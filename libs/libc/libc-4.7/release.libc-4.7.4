Hi, Gals and Guys,

The beta directory has been changed. See below for details.

This is a beta software. Please send your comments to
linux-gcc@vger.rutgers.edu only.

Since libc 4.7.0, the GNU rx 0.07.1 is used to replace the GNU 
regex 0.12. All the old binaries compiled/linked with the old
libc should work fine. But there is a problem with other old libraries
compiled with the old C library if they use regex in libc. Motif
is an example. The old Motif libraries are not compatible with the new
libc. You cannot use the old Motif libraries to compile Motif
source codes with the new libc.

This release is a branch based on libc 4.6.27. It contains only the
minimal necessary patches for libc 4.6.27. No new functions. No
minor bug fixes. This library is designed as an upgrade for libc
4.6.27. The only purpose of this release is to fix the bugs in
the shared libraries. It only supports a.out. It should only be used
together with the new ELF based gcc compiler since the libraries are
installed under /usr/i486-linuxaout/lib. For the new library
and ELF, please use libc 5.0.9 or above. Compiling this library
yourself is strongly discouraged. You should only use it to
replace the old a.out DLL shared libraries in /lib for the old a.out
binaries. You should use libc 5.0.9 or above to compile the new
binaries.

This is the beta release of the Linux C library 4.7.4. You have to
run the kernel and install the source code of the kernel 1.1.92 or
above to use it. It may work with the older kernels. You need a
kernel which supports the QMAGIC format. You also need gcc 2.6.3
or above to use it.

To use this library, you HAVE to use binutils 2.5.2l.17 or above.
You can find it on tsx-11 under pub/linux/packages/GCC.

You need ld.so 1.6.7 or above. It should be found on tsx-11 under
pub/linux/packages/GCC. If it is not there, please try
ftp.ods.com:/pub/linux.

The primary ftp sites for the compiler/C library are tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/packages/GCC/private/tofu and sunsite.unc.edu under
pub/Linux/GCC/private/tofu. The two secondary ftp sites are
i44s10.info.uni-karlsruhe.de under pub/linux/libc/private/dontuse and
ftp.ctd.comsat.com under pub/linux/alpha. Due to the slow link, the
secondary ftp site may not be updated as quickly as tsx-11. Please
check it out yourself. The file names are

1. libc-4.7.4.bin.tar.gz.
2. include-4.7.4.tar.gz.
3. libc-4.7.4.tar.gz.
4. libc-4.7.3-4.7.4.diff.gz.

This release is compressed with gzip 1.2.4. You also need gnu tar
to unpack this package.

Since 4.7.0, the Linux C library is under CVS control thanks to
Michael R. Johnston who sent me a 1 SCSI GB hard drive. I really
appreciate his support. Thanks a lot, Mike. I wish I could afford
a tape drive to backup my hard drives :-).

Now I will generate the diffs for the library source files and
header files only for upgrade. You have to read the diffs and
use -p? to apply the patches. Please let me know if there is
any problem since it is kind of new to me.

Please read ChangeLog for details of the bug fixes and changes.

With bind-4.9.3beta9, you may have to change /etc/resolv.conf. The
resolver's default "search" list will be just the entire "domain" name
rather than the sliding window it had before 4.9.2. This will make the
default search list shorter, so folks who are saying "domain a.b.c"
and relying on the implicit "search a.b.c b.c c" will miss "b.c" and
"c". So what you have to do is add this line into your /etc/resolv.conf:

search  a.b.c b.c c
 
The file list:

1. libc-4.7.4.bin.tar.gz

  REQUIRED.  It has the header files, the stub/static libraries and
  the shared images for libc 4.7.4. To install it, as root do

  cd /
  rm -rf /usr/i486-linuxaout/include
  gzip -dc libc-4.7.4.bin.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -
  ldconfig -v

  The header files in libc-4.7.4.bin.tar.gz are not complete. You have
  to install libc 5.0.9 or above to get some additional header files
  and you have to install the kernel source for the rest of the header
  files.

2. include-4.7.4.tar.gz

  OPTIONAL.  It has the header files for libc 4.7.4. To install it, as
  root do

  cd /
  rm -rf /usr/i486-linuxaout/include
  gzip -dc include-4.7.4.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

  The header files in libc-4.7.4.bin.tar.gz are not complete. You have
  to install libc 5.0.9 or above to get some additional header files
  and you have to install the kernel source for the rest of the header
  files.

3. libc-4.7.4.tar.gz
 
  Source code for 4.7.4. Unpacked in ./libc.
 
  cd src
  rm -rf libc-linux
  gzip -dc libc-4.7.4.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

4. libc-4.7.3-4.7.4.diff.gz

  Patches for the source code from 4.7.3 to 4.7.4. Use it if
  you know how :-(. Hint: use "patch -E -p?".

5. ChangeLog

  Change log for the Linux C library.

Please fix the file permissions/ownership after you install it.
