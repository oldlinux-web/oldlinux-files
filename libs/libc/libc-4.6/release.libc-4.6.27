Hi, Gals and Guys,

This is the public release of the Linux C library 4.6.27. You have to
run the kernel and install the source code of the kernel 1.1.52 or
above to use it. It may work with the older kernels. You need a
kernel which supports the QMAGIC format. You also need gcc 2.6.2
or above to use it.

You need <linux/elf.h> in the kernel 1.1.72 or above if you want to
compile the ELF libraries yourself. Otherwise, please join the Linux
gcc list.

You need to recompile the libraries with the kernel 1.1.65 or above
to gain the support for 57600 and 115200 bps.

Thanks to Stephen L Moshier and Olaf Flebbe, the long double stdio
support and the long double math lib are in,

The librx from the latest libg++ 2.6.2 beta replaced the old GNU regex
library. The old DLL binaries should work fine. But all the new
ELF binaries which uses the GNU regex directly need to be re-compiled
if they are linked with the shared library. When you compile any
packages which come with their own regex, you HAVE to check if they
have the same functions names in regex. If they do, you HAVE to remove
the one in the package and use the one in libc since ELF will binds
all of them to the same symbol names at the runtime. You have to
recompile the ELF version of those binaries. If it is not 100%
compatible with the one in libc, you are screwed. The reason for that
is the ELF dynamic linker will bind the regex symbols at the run-time
if you are using the shared ELF library. The shared ELF Linux C library
was compiled with librx. If you have a local regex which has the
same symbol names as librx, the ELF dynamic linker will use your local
ones instead of the one in the Linux C library for all references
including the shared ELF Linux C library. If your local regex is not
100% compatible, I don't know what will happen. FYI, I just did that
for gawk 2.15.5 as well as GNU m4 1.4 plus a patch. They work fine.

Due to the compatibility problem, libndbm is replaced by gdbm 1.7.3.
The BSD libdb is still there. But I don't know what's the impact on
it. The old nvi compiled/linked with libdb runs fine with the new
libraries.

There is a new select () in libbsd which doesn't return the remaining
time out for compatibility. Just add -lbsd to link with it.

To use this library, you HAVE to use binutils-2.5.2.6.bin.tar.gz for 
a.out. You can find it on tsx-11 under pub/linux/packages/GCC.

You need ld.so 1.5.2 or above to manipulate the ELF/PIC libraries. It
should be found on tsx-11 under pub/linux/packages/GCC. If it is not
there, please try oldtwok.ods.com:/pub/linux. The IP address of
oldtwok.ods.com is 192.94.73.2.

Please get tools 2.16 under pub/linux/packages/GCC/src from
tsx-11.mit.edu and install it in order to compile this library
from the source code yourself.

The primary ftp sites for the compiler/C library are tsx-11.mit.edu
under pub/linux/packages/GCC and sunsite.unc.edu under pub/Linux/GCC.
The file names are

1. inc-4.6.27.tar.gz.
2. libc-4.6.27.tar.gz.
3. image-4.6.27.tar.gz.
4. extra-4.6.27.tar.gz.
5. inc-4.6.20-4.6.27.tar.gz.
6. libc-4.6.20-4.6.27.tar.gz.

This release is compressed with gzip 1.2.4. You also need gnu tar
to unpack this package.

I have put the stub libraries for the shared math and termcap and back.
The gdbm 1.7.3 is in and the shared stubs are restored. db 1.85 from
BSD 4.4 is also in.

I updated to the BSD 4.4 curses and made a new separate libcurses.so.
But the old curses binaries should still work fine with the libc 4.6.27.
Please check it out. The newly compiled curses library will be linked
with libcurses.so. BTW, the file name of libcurses.so is longer than
14 characters. You cannot put it on a minix filesystem.

Please read ChangeLog for details of the bug fixes and changes.

Since we go back to gdbm for dbm, please do

  cd /usr/lib
  rm -f libdbm.*

If you decide to untar the image-4.6.27.tar.gz or extra-4.6.27.tar.gz,
please first do

  cd /usr/lib
  rm -f libg.a libc_p.a libc.a

With bind-4.9.3beta9, you may have to change /etc/resolv.conf. The
resolver's default "search" list will be just the entire "domain" name
rather than the sliding window it had before 4.9.2. This will make the
default search list shorter, so folks who are saying "domain a.b.c"
and relying on the implicit "search a.b.c b.c c" will miss "b.c" and
"c". So what you have to do is add this line into your /etc/resolv.conf:

search  a.b.c b.c c
 
The file list:

1. inc-4.6.27.tar.gz

  REQUIRED. It is the header files for 4.6.27.

  cd /
  rm -f /usr/include/dbm.h
  rm -f /usr/include/ndbm.h
  rm -f /usr/include/gdbm.h
  gzip -dc inc-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xvvSof -
  # Please be careful, I don't know what you have under /usr/include.
  # If you have a problem with the header files, you may do 
  #	rm -rf /usr/include
  #	mkdir -p /usr/include
  # before
  #	gzip -dc inc-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

  The header files in inc-4.6.27.tar.gz are not complete. You have to
  install the kernel source for the rest of the header files. Please
  get the version mentioned at the beginning of this release note.
  Suppose you install the kernel source at "/foo/bar/src", you should
  do as root

  cd /usr/include
  ln -s /foo/bar/src/linux/include/asm .
  ln -s /foo/bar/src/linux/include/linux .
  
  Since some programs need <linux/autoconf.h>, you may have to do
			  
  cd /foo/bar/src/linux
  make config
			       
  before you can compile them.

2. libc-4.6.27.tar.gz
 
  Source code for 4.6.27.
 
  cd src
  rm -rf libc-linux
  gzip -dc libc-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

3. image-4.6.27.tar.gz

  REQUIRED. The stub/static libraries and the shared images. To
  install it, as root do

  cd /
  rm -f /usr/lib/libdbm.*
  gzip -dc image-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -
  ldconfig -v

  FYI, it seems tar -S doesn't work cross the platforms. You may want
  to use cp -a to save some disk spaces.

4. extra-4.6.27.tar.gz
 
  REQUIRED. libmcheck.a, libg.a, libc_p.a, libgmon.a and gcrt0.o. To
  install

  cd /
  gzip -dc extra-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

  If you don't want a profiling and a debugging libc, please do

  cd /usr/lib
  ln -sf libc.a libc_p.a
  ln -sf libc.a libg.a

5. inc-4.6.20-4.6.27.tar.gz

  Change of the header files from 4.6.20 to 4.6.27.

  cd /
  gzip -dc inc-4.6.20-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

6. libc-4.6.20-4.6.27.tar.gz

  Change of the source code from 4.6.20 to 4.6.27. You have to use
  ld.so 1.5.2 or newer to install the compiled ELF/PIC libraries.

  cd src
  gzip -dc libc-4.6.20-4.6.27.tar.gz | tar xSvvof -

7. ChangeLog

  Change log for the Linux C library.

Please fix the file permissions/ownership after you install it.

Fri Nov 25 08:12:20 1994  Robert Andrew Ryan (rr2b+@andrew.cmu.edu)

	* elf/d-link/hash.c (_dl_find_hash): add a new parameter,
	  int copyrel. Symbol resolution has been fixed so that data
	  symbols from a shared object which get copied into the
	  executable will work properly. Previously dynamically loaded
	  code would see the definition in the shared object instead of
	  the copy.

	* elf/d-link/hash.h (_dl_find_hash): fix the prototype.

	* elf/d-link/readelflib1.c:
	* elf/d-link/i386/boot1.c: All mmap calls are now properly
	  checked for failure. Previously some were unchecked and
	  others where checked only for 0xffffffff. The mmap system
	  call actually returns -errno.

	* elf/d-link/i386/boot1.c (_dl_boot): add 0 to _dl_find_hash ().
	  (_dl_malloc): _dl_malloc has been fixed to allocate additional
	  pages as needed.

	* elf/d-link/i386/elfinterp.c (_dl_linux_resolver):
	  (_dl_parse_relocation_information): add 0 to _dl_find_hash ().
	  (_dl_parse_copy_information): add 1 to _dl_find_hash ().

	* elf/d-link/i386/syscall.h (_dl_MAX_ERRNO): new. defined as
	  4096.
	  (_dl_mmap_check_error): new macro. defined as

	  #define _dl_mmap_check_error(__res)   \
		(((int)__res) < 0 && ((int)__res) >= -_dl_MAX_ERRNO)

	* elf/d-link/libdl/dlib.c (_dlsym): add 0 to _dl_find_hash ().
	  (_dlclose): Symbol resolution during fini execution was
	  causing a segfault. Now the fini sections are run before the
	  objects which might be needed for them are unloaded.
