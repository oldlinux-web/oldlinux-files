IntroductionIntroduction

MicroEMACS is a tool for  creating and changing documents, programs, and
other text files. It is both relatively easy  for  the  novice  to use, but also
very  powerful  in  the  hands  of  an  expert.  MicroEMACS  can be  extensively
customized for the needs of the individual user.

MicroEMACS allows  several  files  to  be  edited  at the same time. The
screen can be split into different  windows  and  screens, and text may be moved
freely from one window on  any screen to the next. Depending on the type of file
being edited,  MicroEMACS  can  change  how  it  behaves to make editing simple.
Editing standard text files, program files and word processing documents are all
possible at the same time.

There are extensive capabilities to  make  word  processing  and editing
easier. These include commands for  string  searching  and  replacing, paragraph
reformatting and deleting, automatic word  wrapping, word move and deletes, easy
case controlling, and automatic word counts.

For complex and repetitive editing tasks editing macroes can be written.
These  macroes  allow  the user a great degree of flexibility in determining how
MicroEMACS  behaves. Also, any and all the commands can be used by any keystroke
by changing, or rebinding, what commands various keys invoke.

Special  features  are  also  available  to  perform  a diverse  set  of
operations such  as file encryption, automatic backup file generation, entabbing
and detabbing lines, executing operating system commands and  filtering  of text
through other programs (like SORT to allow sorting text).

HistoryHistory

EMACS was originally a text editor written by Richard Stallman at MIT in
the early 1970s for Digital  Equipment computers. Various versions, rewrites and
clones have made an appearance since.

This version  of  MicroEMACS  is  derived  from  code written by Dave G.
Conroy in 1985. Later  modifications  were performed by Steve Wilhite and George
Jones. In December of 1985 Daniel Lawrence picked  up  the  then  current source
(version  2.0) and made extensive modifications and additions  to  it  over  the
course of the next six years.  Updates  and  support for the current version are
still  available.  Commercial  support  and  usage and resale licences are  also
available. The current program author can be contacted by writing to:

CreditsCredits

Many people have been involved in creating this software and we  wish to
credit some of them here. Dave Conroy, of course, wrote  the  very first version
of MicroEMACS, and it is a credit to his clean coding that so much work was able
to  be done to expand it. John Gamble is responsible for writing the MAGIC  mode
search routines, and for maintaining all the search code. Jeff Lomicka wrote the
appendix on DEC VMS and has supplied a lot of code to support VMS and  the ATARI
1040ST versions. Curtis Smith wrote the  original  VMS code and help support the
Commodore AMIGA. Also Lance Jones  has  done  a  lot  of work on the AMIGA code.
Professor Suresh Konda at Carnegie Mellon University has  put  a  lot  of effort
into  writing  complex  macros and finding all the bugs in  the  macro  language
before anyone else does.

A  special  thanks to Dana Hoggatt who  has  provided  an  almost  daily
sounnding board  for  ideas,  algorithyms  and  code.  He is responcible for the
encryption code  directly  and  has  prodded  me  into adding many features with
simple but poignant  questions (Dan? How do we move the upper left corner of the
screen? . . . which forced me to write the text windowing system).

As to people sending  source  code  and  text translations over computer
networks  like  USENET and ARPA net, there are simply more than  can  be  listed
here. [The comments in the edit history in the history.c  file  mention each and
the piece they contributed]. All these people should  be  thanked  for  the hard
work they have put into MicroEMACS.

 Basic Concepts                                 Basic Concepts


The  current  version  of  MicroEMACS  is  3.11  (Third major  re-write,
eleventh public release), and for the rest of  this  document,  we  shall simply
refer to this version as "EMACS".  Any  modifications for later versions will be
in the file README on the MicroEMACS distribution disk.

1.1  Keys and the Keyboard1.1  Keys and the Keyboard


Many times throughout this manual we will be talking about  commands and
the keys on the keyboard needed to use  them.  There  are  a number of "special"
keys which can be used and are listed here:

<NL>               NewLine which is also called RETURN, ENTER, or <NL>, this key
 is used to end different commands.

^                  The control key  can  be used before any alphabetic character
 and  some symbols. For example, ^C means  to  hold  down  the
 <CONTROL> key and type the C key at the same time.

^X                 The CONTROL-X key is used  at the beginning of many different
 commands.

META or M-         This is a special EMACS  key used to begin many commands.This
 key  is  pressed  and then released before  typing  the  next
 character. On most systems, this is the <ESC> key, but it can
 be changed. (consult appendix E to learn what key is used for
 META on your computer).

Whenever  a  command  is described, the  manual  will  list  the  actual
keystrokes needed to  execute  it  in  boldface using the above conventions, and                                       boldface
also the name of the command in italics.                                _______

1.2  Getting Started1.2  Getting Started


In order to use  EMACS,  you  must  call  it  up  from  your  system  or
computer's command prompt. On UNIX and MSDOS machines, just  type  "emacs"  from
the command prompt and follow it with the <RETURN> or <ENTER> key (we will refer
to this key as <NL> for "new-line" for  the  remainder  of  this manual). On the
Macintosh,  the  Amiga,  the ATARI ST, and  under  OS/2  and  other  icon  based
operating systems, double click on the uEMACS icon. Shortly after this, a screen
similar to the one below should appear.

1.3  Parts and Pieces1.3  Parts and Pieces


The screen is divided into a number of areas or windows. On some systems                                                        windows
the top window contains a function list of unshifted and shifted  function keys.
We will discuss these keys  later. Below them is an EMACS mode line which, as we                                                          mode line
will see, informs you of  the  present  mode  of  operation  of  the editor--for
example  "(WRAP)"  if you set EMACS to wrap at the end of each line.  Under  the
mode line is the text window where text appears and  is  manipulated. Since each                 text window
window has its own mode  line, below the text window is it's mode line. The last
line of the screen is the command line where EMACS takes commands and reports on                          command line
what it is doing.

Entering text in EMACS is simple. Type the following sentence fragment:

The text is displayed at the top of the text window. Now type:

 terrifying events at the turn of the century

Notice that some of your text has dissapeared off the  left  side of the
screen.  Don't panic--your text is safe!!! You've  just  discovered  that  EMACS


 2Basic Concepts                                     MicroEMACS Reference Manual


doesn't "wrap" text to the next  line  like  most word processors unless you hit
<NL>. But since EMACS is used for both word processing, and text editing, it has
a bit of a dual  personality. You can change the way it works by setting various
modes.  In this case, you need to set WRAP mode, using the add-mode command,  bymodes                                 WRAP                 ________
typing ^XM. The  command  line at the base of the screen will prompt you for the       ^XM
mode you wish to add. Type wrap followed by the <NL> key and  any  text  you now                           wrap
enter will be wrapped.  However,  the command doesn't wrap text already entered.
To get rid  of  the long line, press and hold down the <BACKSPACE> key until the
line  is  gone.  Now type in the words you deleted, watch how EMACS goes down to
the next line  at  the right time. (In some versions of EMACS, WRAP is a default                                   ___ ____ ________ __ ______ WRAP __ _ _______                                                               ____
mode in which case you don't  have  to  worry about the instructions relating to____ __ _____ ____ ___ _____  ____  __  _____ _____ ___ ____________ ________ __
adding this mode.)______ ____ ______

Now  let's type a longer insert. Hit <NL> a couple of times to tab  down
from the text you just entered. Now type the following  paragraphs.   Press <NL>
twice to indicate a paragraph break.

 Fang Rock lighthouse, center of  a series of mysterious and terrifying
 events at the turn of the century, is built on a  rocky  island  a few
 miles of the Channel coast. So  small  is the island that wherever you
 stand its rocks are wet with sea spray.

 The lighthouse tower is in the center of the island. A steep flight of
 steps leads to the heavy door in its base. Winding  stairs  lead up to
 the crew room.

1.5  Basic cursor movement1.5  Basic cursor movement


Now let's practice moving around in  this  text. To move the cursor back
to the word "Winding," enter M-B previous-word. This command  moves  the  cursor                             M-B _____________
backwards by one word at  a  time.  Note  you  have to press the key combination
every time the cursor steps back by one  word.  Continuously  pressing  META and
toggling B produces an error message. To move forward to the word "stairs" enter
M-F next-word, which moves the cursor forward by one word at a time.M-F _________

Notice  that  EMACS  commands are usually mnemonic--F for forward, B for
backward, for example.

To move the cursor up one line, enter ^P previous-line, down one line ^N                                              ^P _____________                ^N
next-line. Practice this movement by moving the cursor to the  word "terrifying"_________
in the second line.

The cursor may also be moved forward or backward in  smaller increments.
To move forward by one character, enter ^F forward-character, to  move backward,                                        ^F _________________
^B  backward-character.  EMACS also allows you to  specify  a  number  which  is^B  __________________
normally  used to tell a command to execute many times. To repeat most commands,
press META and then the number before you enter the  command.  Thus, the command
META 5 ^F (M-5^F) will move  the  cursor  forward by five characters. Try moving           M-5^F
around in the text by using  these  commands.  For extra practice, see how close



3MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                       Basic Concepts


you can come to the word "small" in the first paragraph by giving an argument to
the commands listed here.

Two other simple cursor commands that are useful to help us  move around
in  the  text  are M-N next-paragraph which  moves  the  cursor  to  the  second                   M-N ______________
paragraph, and M-P  previous-paragraph  which  moves  it  back  to  the previous               M-P  __________________
paragraph. The cursor may also  be moved rapidly from one end of the line to the
other. Move the cursor to the word "few" in the second line. Press ^A beginning-                                                                   ^A __________
of-line. Notice the cursor moves to  the  word  "events" at the beginning of the_______
line. Pressing ^E end-of-line moves the cursor to the end of the line.               ^E ___________

Finally,  the cursor may be moved from any point in the file to the  end
or beginning of the file. Entering M-> end-of-file moves the  cursor  to the end                                   M-> ___________
of the buffer, M-< beginning-of-file to the first character of the file.               M-< _________________

On the IBM-PC, the ATARI ST and many other machines, the cursor keys can        __ ___ _______ ___ _____ __ ___ ____ _____ _________ ___ ______ ____ ___
also be used to move the cursor.____ __ ____ __ ____ ___ _______

Practice moving the cursor in the text until you  are  comfortable  with
the commands we've explored in this chapter.

1.6  Saving your text1.6  Saving your text


When you've finished practicing  cursor  movement,  save your file. Your
file currently resides in a BUFFER. The buffer is a  temporary  storage area for                            BUFFER
your text, and is lost  when the computer is turned off. You can save the buffer
to a file by entering ^X^S  save-file.  Notice  that EMACS informs you that your                      ^X^S  _________
file has no name and will not let you save it.

To save your buffer to a  file  with  a different name than it's current
one  (which  is empty), press ^X^W write-file.  EMACS will prompt  you  for  the                              ^X^W __________
filename you wish to write. Enter the  name  fang.txt  and  press  return.  On a                                             fang.txt
micro, the drive light will come on, and EMACS will inform you it is writing the
file. When it finishes, it will inform you of the number of lines it has written
to the disk.

Congratulations!! You've just saved your first EMACS file!

2.1  A Word About Windows, Buffers, Screens, and Modes2.1  A Word About Windows, Buffers, Screens, and Modes


In the first chapter, you learned how  to  create  and  save  a  file in
EMACS. Let's do  some  more editing on this file. Call up emacs by typing in the
following command.

emacs fang.txt        emacs fang.txt

On icon oriented  systems,  double  click  on the uEMACS icon, usually a        __ ____ ________  ________  ______  _____  __ ___ ______ _____ _______ _
file dialog box of some sort  will  appear. Choose FANG.TXT from the appropriate____ ______ ___ __ ____ ____  ____  _______ ______ FANG.TXT ____ ___ ___________                                                   ________
folder._______

Shortly after you  invoke  EMACS,  the  text should appear on the screen
ready  for  you  to  edit.  The text you are looking at currently resides  in  a
buffer. A  buffer  is  a  temporary area of computer memory which is the primarybuffer
unit internal to  EMACS  -- this is the place where EMACS goes to work. The mode
line at the bottom of the screen lists the buffer name, FANG.TXT and the name of                                                        FANG.TXT
the file with which this buffer is associated, FANG.TXT                                               FANG.TXT

The computer talks to you through the use  of  its  screen.  This screen                                                            screen
usually has an area of  24 lines each of 80 characters across. You can use EMACS
to  subdivide  the  screen into several separate work areas, or windows, each of                                                                windows
which can be 'looking into' different files or sections of text.  Using windows,
you can work  on several related texts at one time, copying and moving blocks of
text  between  windows with ease. To keep track of what you  are  editing,  each
window is identified  by  a mode line on the last line of the window which lists                            mode line
the  name  of  the buffer which it is looking into, the file from which the text                   buffer
was read, and how the text is being edited.

An EMACS mode  tells  EMACS  how  to  deal  with  user input. As we have                 mode
already  seen,  the  mode 'WRAP' controls how EMACS deals with long lines (lines
with  over  79 characters) while the user is typing them in.  The  'VIEW'  mode,
allows you to read a  file  without  modifying  it.  Modes  are  associated with
buffers and not  with files; hence, a mode needs to be explicitly set or removed
every  time you edit a file. A new file read into a  buffer  with  a  previously
specified  mode  will  be  edited  under  this  mode. If you use specific  modes
frequently, EMACS allows you to set the modes which are used by all new buffers,
called global modes.       global

 Fang Rock lighthouse, center of  a series of mysterious and terrifying
 events at the turn of the century, is built on a  rocky  island  a few
 miles of the Channel coast. So  small  is the island that wherever you
 stand its rocks are wet with sea spray.

 The lighthouse tower is in the center of the island. A steep flight of
 steps leads to the heavy door in its base. Winding  stairs  lead up to
 the crew room.

Let's  assume  you  want to add a sentence in the second paragraph after
the word "base."  Move the cursor until it is on the "W" of "Winding".  Now type
the following:

 This  gives entry to the lower floor where  the  big  steam  generator
 throbs steadily away, providing power for the electric lantern.

If the line fails to wrap and you end up with a '$'  sign  in  the right
margin, just enter  M-Q  fill-paragraph  to  reformat  the  paragraph.  This new                    M-Q  ______________
command attempts to fill out a paragraph. Long lines are  divided  up, and words
are shuffled around to make the paragraph look nicer.

Notice that all visible EMACS characters are self-inserting  --  all you
had to do was type the characters to insert and the existing text made space for
it. With a few exceptions discussed later, all non-printing characters  (such as
control  or escape sequences) are commands. To insert  spaces,  simply  use  the
space bar. Now move to the first line of the file and type ^O open-line (Oh, not                                                           ^O _________
zero).  You've just learned how to insert a blank line in your text.

2.3  Deletions2.3  Deletions


EMACS offers a number of deletion options. For example, move  the cursor
until it's under the period at the end of the insertion you just did.  Press the
backspace  key.  Notice   the   "n"  on  "lantern"  disappeared.  The  backspace
implemented  on  EMACS  is  called  a  destructive  backspace--it  removes  text                                       destructive
immediately  before the current cursor position from the  buffer.  Now  type  ^H                                                                              ^H
delete-previous-character. Notice that the cursor moves back and obliterates the_________________________
"r"--either command will backspace the cursor.

Type in  the  two  letters  you erased to restore your text and move the
cursor to the  beginning  of  the  buffer M-> beginning-of-file. Move the cursor                                          M-> _________________
down one line to the beginning of the first paragraph.

To delete  the forward character, type ^D delete-next-character. The "F"                                               ^D _____________________
of "Fang" disappears. Continue to type ^D until the whole  word  is erased EMACS                                       ^D
also permits  the  deletion  of  larger elements of text. Move the cursor to the


7MicroEMACS Reference Manual       Basic Editing--Simple Insertions and Deletions


word "center" in the first line of text. Pressing M-<backspace> delete-previous-                                                  M-<backspace> ________________
word kills the word immediately before the cursor. M-^H has the same effect.____                                               M-^H

Notice that the commands are very similar to the  control  commands  you
used to delete individual letters. As a general rule in EMACS, control sequences
affect small areas of text, META sequences larger areas. The word forward of the
cursor position can therefore  be  deleted  by  typing M-D delete-next-word. Now                                                       M-D ________________
let's take out the remainder of the first line by typing ^K kill-to-end-of-line.                                                         ^K ___________________
You now have a blank line at the top of your screen.  Typing  ^K  again  or ^X^O                                                              ^K            ^X^O
delete-blank-lines deletes the blank line and flushes the second line to the top__________________
of  the text. Now exit EMACS by typing ^X^C exit-emacs. Notice EMACS reminds you                                       ^X^C __________
that  you have not saved your buffer. Ignore the warning and exit. This way  you
can exit EMACS without saving any of the changes you just made.

 Using Regions                                 Using Regions


3.1  Defining and Deleting a Region3.1  Defining and Deleting a Region


At  this point its time to familiarize ourselves  with  two  more  EMACS
terms--the point and the mark. The point is located directly behind  the current           point         mark
cursor position. The mark (as we shall see shortly) is  user  defined. These two
elements  together are called the current region and limit the region of text on                                          region               region
which EMACS performs many of its editing functions.

Let's  begin by entering some new text. Don't forget to add wrap mode if                                                                    wrap
its not set on this buffer. Start EMACS and open a file called PUBLISH.TXT. Type                                                               PUBLISH.TXT
in the following text:

 One  of  the  largest growth areas in personal computing is electronic
 publishing. There are packages available for practically every machine
 from  elegantly  simple  programs  for  the  humble  Commodore  64  to
 sophisticated professional packages for PC and Macintosh computers.

 Electronic publishing is as revolutionary  in its way as the Gutenburg
 press.  Whereas the printing press allowed  the  mass  production  and
 distribution of the written word, electronic publishing puts the means
 of production in the hands of nearly every individual. From  the class
 magazine to the corporate report,  electronic  publishing  is changing
 the way we produce and disseminate information.

 Personal publishing greatly increases the utility of practically every
 computer. Thousands of people  who  joined  the computer revolution of
 this  decade  only  to hide their  machines  unused  in  closets  have
 discovered a new use for them as dedicated publishing workstations.

Now let's do  some  editing.  The  last  paragraph seems a little out of
place.  To  see what the document looks like without it we can cut it  from  the
text by moving the cursor to  the  beginning  of the paragraph.  Enter M-<space>                                                                       M-<space>
set-mark. EMACS will respond with "[Mark set]". Now move the  cursor  to the end________
of the paragraph.    You have just defined a region of text. To remove this text
from the screen, type ^W kill-region. The paragraph disappears from the screen.                      ^W ___________

On further consideration,  however,  perhaps the paragraph we cut wasn't
so bad after  all.  The problem may have been one of placement. If we could tack
it on to the end of the first paragraph it might work quite well to  support and
strengthen the argument. Move the cursor to the end of  the  first paragraph and
enter ^Y yank. Your text should now look like this:      ^Y ____

 the way we produce and disseminate information.

3.2  Yanking a Region3.2  Yanking a Region


The text you cut initially didn't simply just disappear, it was cut into
a buffer that retains the 'killed' text appropriately called the kill buffer. ^Y                                                                 kill buffer  ^Y
"yanks" the text back from this buffer into the current buffer.  If  you  have a
long line (indicated, remember, by the "$" sign), simply hit M-Q to reformat the                                                             M-Q
paragraph.

There  are  other uses to which the kill buffer can be  put.  Using  the
method we've already learned, define the last paragraph as a region. Now type M-                                                                              M-
W copy-region. Nothing seems to have happened; the cursor stays blinking  at theW ___________
point. But  things  have  changed,  even  though  you may not be able to see any
alteration.

To see what has happened to  the  contents  of the kill buffer, move the
cursor down a couple of lines and "yank" the contents of  the  kill  buffer back
with ^Y. Notice the last paragraph  is  now  repeated. The region you defined is     ^Y
"tacked  on" to the end of your file because M-W copies a  region  to  the  kill                                             M-W copies
buffer while leaving the original text  in  your working buffer. Some caution is
needed however, because the contents of the kill  buffer  are  updated  when you
delete  any regions, lines or words. If you are moving large quantities of text,
complete the operation before you do any more deletions or  you  could find that
the  text  you  want  to  move  has been replaced by the most  recent  deletion.
Remember--a  buffer is a temporary area of computer memory that is lost when the
machine is  powered  down  or  switched  off.  In  order  to  make  your changes
permanent, they must be saved to a file before you leave EMACS. Let's delete the
section of text we just added and save the file to disk.

4.1  Forward Search4.1  Forward Search


Load EMACS and bring in the file you just saved.  Your  file should look
like the one below.

 One  of  the  largest growth areas in personal computing is electronic
 publishing. There are packages available for practically every machine
 from  elegantly  simple  programs  for  the  humble  Commodore  64  to
 sophisticated professional packages for  PC  and  Macintosh computers.
 Personal publishing greatly increases the utility of practically every
 computer. Thousands of people  who  joined  the computer revolution of
 this  decade  only  to hide their  machines  unused  in  closets  have
 discovered a new use for them as dedicated publishing workstations.

 Electronic publishing is as revolutionary  in its way as the Gutenburg
 press.  Whereas the printing press allowed  the  mass  production  and
 distribution of the written word, electronic publishing puts the means
 of production in the hands of nearly every individual. From  the class
 magazine to the corporate report,  electronic  publishing  is changing
 the way we produce and disseminate information.

Let's use EMACS  to  search  for  the word "revolutionary" in the second
paragraph.  Because  EMACS  searches from the current cursor position toward the
end  of  buffers,  and we intend to search  forward,  move  the  cursor  to  the
beginning of the text. Enter ^S  search-forward.  Note that the command line now                             ^S  ______________
reads

"Search [] <META>:"

EMACS is prompting you to enter the search string --  the  text you want                                            search string
to find. Enter  the word revolutionary and hit the META key. The cursor moves to                         revolutionary             META
the end of the word "revolutionary."

Notice that you must enter the  <META>  key  to start the search. If you
simply press <NL> the command line responds with "<NL>".  Although this may seem
infuriating  to  users who are used to pressing the return key  to  execute  any
command,  EMACS' use of <META> to begin searches allows it to pinpoint text with
great accuracy. After every line wrap or carriage  return,  EMACS  'sees'  a new
line character (<NL>).  If you need to search for  a  word at the end of a line,
you can specify this word uniquely in EMACS.



13MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                   Search and Replace


In our sample text for example, the word "and" occurs a number of times,
but only once at the  end of a line. To search for this particular occurrence of
the word, move the cursor to the beginning  of  the  buffer  and type ^S. Notice                                                                      ^S
that EMACS stores the last specified search string as the default string. If you                                                          default
press <META> now, EMACS will  search  for  the  default  string,  in  this case,      <META>
"revolutionary."

To  change  this  string so we can search for our specified "and" simply
enter the word and followed by <NL>. The command line now shows:               and             <NL>

"search [and<NL>]<META>:"

Press <META> and the cursor moves to "and" at the end of the second last              <META>
line.

4.2  Exact Searches4.2  Exact Searches


If the mode EXACT is active in the current buffer,  EMACS  searches on a
case sensitive  basis.  Thus,  for  example  you  could search for Publishing as                                                                   Publishing
distinct from publishing.              publishing


4.3  Backward Search4.3  Backward Search


Backward searching is very similar to forward searching  except  that it
is implemented in the reverse direction. To implement a reverse search,  type ^R                                                                              ^R
search-reverse. Because  EMACS makes no distinction between forward and backward______________
stored search strings, the last search  item  you entered appears as the default
string. Try  searching  back  for  any word that lies between the cursor and the
beginning of the  buffer. Notice that when the item is found, the point moves to
the beginning of  the  found  string  (i.e.,  the cursor appears under the first
letter of the search item).

Practice searching for other words in your text.

4.4  Searching and Replacing4.4  Searching and Replacing


Searching and replacing is a powerful and quick way of making changes to
your text. Our sample text is about electronic publishing, but the  correct term
is  'desktop'  publishing.  To make the necessary changes we need to replace all
occurrences of the word  "electronic"  with "desktop." First, move the cursor to
the top of the current buffer with the M-< command. Then type M-R replace-string                                       M-<                    M-R ______________
The command line responds:

"Replace []<META>:"

where  the square brackets enclose the default  string.  Type  the  word
electronic and hit <META>. The command line responds:electronic         <META>


14Search and Replace                                 MicroEMACS Reference Manual


"with []<META>"

type desktop<META>. EMACS replaces  all  instances  of the original word             desktop<META>
with your revision. Of course, you will have to capitalize  the  first letter of
"desktop" where it occurs at the beginning of a sentence.

You have just completed an  unconditional  replace.  In  this operation,                                    unconditional  replace
EMACS replaces every instance of the found string with the replacement string.

4.5  Query-Replace4.5  Query-Replace


You may also replace text on a  case  by  case  basis.  The  M-^R query-                                                                     M-^R ______
replace-string command  causes  EMACS  to  pause  at  each instance of the found______________
string.

For  example,  assume we want to replace  some  instances  of  the  word
"desktop" with the  word  "personal."  Go  back  to the beginning of the current
buffer and enter the  M-^R  query-replace command. The procedure is very similar                      M-^R  _____________
to that which you followed in the unconditional search/replace option.  When the
search begins however, you will notice that EMACS  pauses  at  each  instance of
"publishing"  and  asks whether you wish to  replace  it  with  the  replacement
string. You have a number of options available for response:

Response        Effect        ________        ______
Y(es)   Make the current replacement and skip to the next
occurrence of the search string

N(o)    Do not make this replacement but continue

!       Do the rest of the replacements with no more queries

U(ndo)  Undo just the last replacement and query for it
again (This can only go back ONE time)

^G      Abort the replacement command (This action does not
undo previously-authorized replacements

. Same effect as ^G, but cursor returns to the point at
which the replacement command was given

?       This lists help for the query replacement command

Practice  searching  and  searching  and   replacing   until   you  feel
comfortable with the commands and their effects.

multiple windowing. Windows offer you a powerful and easy way  to  edit text. By
manipulating a number of  windows  and buffers on the screen simultaneously, you
can perform complete  edits  and  revisions  on the computer screen while having
your draft text or original data available for reference in another window.

You will recall that windows are areas of buffer text  that  you can see
on the screen. Because EMACS can support several  screen  windows simultaneously
you can use them to  look into different places in the same buffer. You can also
use  them to look at text in different buffers. In effect, you can edit  several
files at the same time.

Let's invoke  EMACS  and  pull  back  our  file on desktop publishing by
typing

 emacs publish.txt

When the text appears,  type  the  ^X2 split-current-window command. The                                           ^X2 ____________________
window  splits  into  two windows. The window where the cursor resides is called
the current window -- in this  case  the  bottom window. Notice that each window    current
has  a text area and a mode line. The command line is  however,  common  to  all                                      command line
windows on the screen.

The two windows on your screen are virtually mirror images of each other
because the new window is opened into the same buffer as the one you are in when
you issue the open-window command. All commands issued to EMACS are  executed on              ___________ _______
the current buffer in the current window.

To move the cursor to the  upper  window  (i.e., to make that window the
current window, type ^XP previous-window.  Notice the cursor moves to  the upper                     ^XP _______________
or previous window. Entering ^XO next-window moves to the next  window. Practice   previous                  ^XO ___________              next
moving between windows. You will notice that you can also move into the Function
Key menu by entering these commands.

Now  move to the upper window. Let's open a new file. On the EMACS  disk
is a tutorial file. Let's call it into the upper window by typing:

 ^X^F



17MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                              Windows


and press return.

Enter the filename emacs.tut.                           emacs.tut

In a  short  time,  the  tutorial file will appear in the window. We now
have two windows on the screen, each looking  into  different  buffers.  We have
just  used  the  ^X^F  find-file  command to find a file and bring it  into  our                 ^X^F  _________
current window.

You can scroll  any window up and down with the cursor keys, or with the
commands we've learned so far. However, because the area of visible text in each
window is relatively small, you can scroll the current window a line at a time.

Type ^X^N move-window-down             ^X^N ________________

The  current  window scrolls down by one line -- the top  line  of  text
scrolls out of view, and the bottom line moves towards the  top  of  the screen.
You can imagine, if you  like, the whole window slowly moving down to the end of
the buffer in increments of one  line.  The command ^X^P move-window-up  scrolls                                                    ^X^P ______________
the window in the opposite direction.

As  we have seen, EMACS editing commands are  executed  in  the  current
window,  but the program does support a useful feature that allows you to scroll
the next window.  M-^Z scroll-next-up  scrolls  the next window up, M-^V scroll-    next          M-^Z ______________                               M-^V _______
next-down  scrolls it downward.  From the tutorial  window,  practice  scrolling_________
the window with the desktop publishing text in it up and down.

When  you're finished, exit EMACS without saving  any  changes  in  your
files.


Experiment with splitting the windows  on your screen. Open windows into
different buffers and experiment with any other files you may have.  Try editing
the text in  each  window, but don't forget to save any changes you want to keep
-- you still have to save each buffer separately.

5.2  Deleting Windows5.2  Deleting Windows

Windows allow you to perform complex editing tasks  with  ease. However,
they become an inconvenience when your screen is cluttered with open windows you
have finished using. The simplest solution is to delete  unneeded  windows.  The
command ^X0 delete-window will delete the window you are  currently  working  in        ^X0 _____________
and move you to the next window.

If you have a number of windows open, you can delete all but the current
window by entering ^X1 delete-other-windows.                   ^X1 ____________________

5.3  Resizing Windows5.3  Resizing Windows

During  complex  editing  tasks, you will probably find it convenient to
have a number of windows on the screen simultaneously.  However  this  situation


18Windows                                            MicroEMACS Reference Manual


may present inconveniences because the more  windows  you have on the screen the
smaller  they  are; in some cases, a window may show only a couple of  lines  of
text. To increase the  flexibility  and utility of the window environment, EMACS
allows you to  resize the window you are working in (called, as you will recall,
the  current window) to a convenient size for easier editing, and then shrink it     current
when you no longer need it to be so large.

Let's  try an example. Load in any EMACS text file and split the current
window into two. Now type  ^X^(Shift-6), grow-window. Your current window should                           ^X^(Shift-6)  ___________
be the lower one on  the screen. Notice that it increases in size upwards by one
line.  If  you  are in the upper window, it increases  in  size  in  a  downward
direction. The command ^X^Z, shrink-window correspondingly decreases window size                       ^X^Z  _____________
by one line at a time.

EMACS  also  allows  you to resize a window more precisely by entering a
numeric  argument  specifying  the size of the window in lines.  To  resize  the
window this way, press the META  key  and  enter a numeric argument (remember to
keep it smaller  than the number of lines on your screen display) then press ^XW                                                                             ^XW
resize-window.  The current window will be enlarged or shrunk  to  the number of_____________
lines specified in the numeric argument. For example entering:

 M-8 ^XW     M-8 ^XW

will resize the current window to 8 lines.

5.4  Repositioning within a Window5.4  Repositioning within a Window


The  cursor  may  be centered within a window by entering  M-!  or  M-^L                                                                   M-!  or  M-^L
redraw-display. This command is  especially  useful  in  allowing you to quickly______________
locate the cursor if you are  moving  frequently  from window to window. You can
also use  this  command  to  move the line containing the cursor to any position
within the current window. This is done by using a  numeric  argument before the
command.  Type M-<n> M-^L where <n> is the number of the line within the  window               M-<n> M-^L
that you wish the current line to be displayed.

The  ^L  clear-and-redraw  command is useful for 'cleaning up' a 'messy'             ^L  ________________
screen  that  can  result  of  using  EMACS  on a  mainframe  system  and  being
interrupted by a system message.

 Chapter 6                                   Chapter 6

 Using a Mouse                                 Using a Mouse


On computers equipped with a mouse, the mouse  can  usually  be  used to
make editing  easier.  If  your  computer has a mouse, let's try using it. Start
MicroEMACS by typing:

emacs publish.txt

This brings EMACS  up  and  allows  it  to  edit  the file from the last
chapter.  If the function key window is visible on the screen, press the F5  key
to cause it to disappear. Now use the ^X2 split-current-window command  to split                                      ^X2 ____________________
the screen into two windows.  Next use the ^X^F find-file command to read in the                                           ^X^F _________
fang.txt  file.  Now  your screen should  have  two  windows  looking  into  twofang.txt
different files.

Grab  the mouse and move it around. On the screen an arrow, or block  of
color  appears.  This is called the mouse cursor and can be  positioned  on  any
character on the screen. On some computers, positioning the mouse cursor  in the
extreme upper right or left corner may  bring  down  menus  which  allow  you to
access that computers utilities, sometimes called Desk Accessories.                                                  Desk Accessories

6.1  Moving around with the mouse6.1  Moving around with the mouse


Using the mouse button (or the  left  button  if the mouse has more than
one), position the mouse over some character in the current  window.   Click the
mouse button once. The point  will  move  to  where  the mouse cursor is. If you                       point
place the mouse cursor past the end of a line, the point will move to the end of
that line.

Move  the  mouse cursor into the other window and click on  one  of  the
characters there. MicroEMACS will automatically  make  this  window  the current
window (notice that the mode line changes) and position the  point  to the mouse
cursor. This makes it very easy to use the mouse to switch to a different window
quickly.

6.2  Dragging around6.2  Dragging around


Besides just using the mouse to move around on the  screen,  you can use
the same button to move text. Move the mouse cursor to a character in one of the
windows, and click  down... but don't let the button up yet! The point will move
to where the mouse cursor is. Now move  the  mouse  cursor  up  or  down  on the
screen, and  release  the  button.  The point will again move to where the mouse


21MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                        Using a Mouse


cursor  is,  but this time it will bring the text under it along for  the  ride.
This is called dragging, and  is how you can make the text appear just where you               dragging
want it to. If you try to drag text out of the current window, EMACS will ignore
your attempt and leave the point where you first clicked down.

Now, click down on a word in one of the windows, and drag it directly to
the left. Release the button and watch as the entire  window  slides, or scrolls                                                                         scrolls
to the left.    The missing text has not been deleted, it is simply not visible,
off the left  hand  side of the screen. Notice the mode line has changed and now
looks like:

==== MicroEMACS 3.11 [<12] () == fang.txt == File: fang.txt =========

The number insided the brackets [] shows that the screen is now scrolled
12 characters from the left margin.

Now grab the same text again, and drag it to the right, pulling the rest
of  the text back into the current window. The [<] field will disappear, meaning
that the window is no  longer scrolled to the left.  This feature is very useful
for  looking  at  wide charts and tables.  Remember, MicroEMACS will only scroll
the text in the current window sideways if  you  drag  it  straight to the side,
otherwise it will drag the text vertically.

Now, place the mouse cursor over a character  on  the  upper  mode line,
click down, move the mouse cursor up or down a  few  lines  and  let  go  of the
button. The mode  line  moves to where you dragged it,  changing the size of the
windows above and below it. If you try to make a window with less than one line,
EMACS will not  let  you. Dragging the mode lines can make it very fast and easy
for you to rearrange the windows as you would like.

If  you  have  a  number  of  different  windows  visible on the screen,
positioning the mouse over the mode  line  of  one window and clicking the right
mouse button will cause that window to be deleted.

6.3  Cut and Paste6.3  Cut and Paste


If  your mouse has two buttons, then you can use the right button to  do
some  other things as well. Earlier, we learned how to define a region by  using                                                                region
the M-<space> set-mark command. Now, position the mouse over at the beginning of    M-<space> ________
a  region  you  would  like  to copy. Next click and hold down the  right  mouse
button. Notice that the point jumps to the mouse cursor and EMACS reports "[Mark
Set]". Holding the button down move the mouse to the end of the text you wish to
copy and release the mouse button.  Emacs reports "[Region  Copied]"  to let you
know it has  copied  the region into the KILL buffer. This has done the same job
as the M-W copy-region command.       M-W ___________

If you now click the right  mouse  button, without moving the mouse, the
region you defined dissapear, being cut from the current buffer. This works just                                    cut
like the ^W kill-region command.         ^W ___________



22Using a Mouse                                      MicroEMACS Reference Manual


If you move the mouse away from where you cut the  text,  and  click the
right mouse button down and up without moving the mouse, the  text  in  the KILL
buffer gets inserted, or pasted into the current buffer at the point.

6.4  Screens6.4  Screens


MicroEMACS can use more than  one  screen  at  once.  Each  screen  is a
collection of windows along with a mode line.  These  screens  usually  fill the              _______
terminal or computer screen on text based  systems,  but  can  also  be  held in
different windows on graphically based systems like MicroSoft Windows, OS/2, the          windows
Macintosh Finder and X-Windows. Don't be  confused  by the two different uses of
the term "window".  Inside EMACS style editors, a window lets you view part of a                                                  ______
buffer. Under graphical operating systems,  a window holds a "virtual terminal",                                              window
allowing you to  manipulate  more  than  one  job, editing session or program at
once. Within MicroEMACS, these operating  system windows are called screens. All                                                 window
these screens are displayed on your current desktop.

6.5  Resizing a Screen6.5  Resizing a Screen


You can change the size of a screen. Move the mouse to the last position
of  the  command line. Press the left mouse button down. Holding  it,  move  the
mouse  to the place you want the new lower right corner. Release the mouse.  The
desktop redraws, with your  newly  resized  screen.  MicroEMACS will ignore size
changes  that  can not be done, like attempting to pull the  lower  left  corner
above the upper right corner of the current screen.

6.6  Moving a Screen6.6  Moving a Screen


To change where on the desktop a screen is placed, move the mouse to the
upper right  corner  of  the  screen, press the left mouse button down, move the
mouse and release it where you want the screen displayed. Again, MicroEMACS will
ignore placements that can not be done.

6.7  Creating a Screen6.7  Creating a Screen


Creating  a new screen is just like moving a screen, but using the right
button. Move  to  the  upper  right of an existing screen, press the right mouse
button  down,  and  move the mouse, releasing the button where  the  new  screen
should appear. A new screen will  have  a single window, containing the contents                                                 window
of  the current window in the copied screen, and will have that window's colors.                                                                window
The new screen will have the copied screen's size.

 Chapter 7                                   Chapter 7

Buffers                                    Buffers


We  have  already  learned a number of things about buffers. As you will
recall, they are the major internal entities in EMACS -- the place where editing
commands are executed. They  are  characterized by their names, their modes, and                                                         names        modes
by the file with which they are associated.  Each  buffer  also  "remembers" its
mark and point. This convenient feature  allows  you  to go to other buffers andmark     point
return to the original location in the "current" buffer.

Advanced users  of  EMACS  frequently  have  a  number of buffers in the
computer's memory simultaneously. In the last chapter, for  example,  you opened
at least two  buffers  -- one into the text you were editing, and the other into
the  EMACS  on-line  tutorial. If you deal  with  complex  text  files  --  say,
sectioned chapters of a book, you may have five or six buffers in the computer's
memory.  You  could  select different buffers by simply calling up the file with
^X^F find-file, and let EMACS open  or  reopen the buffer. However, EMACS offers^X^F _________
fast and sophisticated buffering techniques that you will find  easy  to  master
and much more convenient to use.

Let's begin by opening three buffers. You can open any three you choose,
for example call the  following  files  into  memory: fang.txt, publish.txt, and                                                      fang.txt  publish.txt
emacs.tut in the order listed here. When you've finished this process, you'll beemacs.tut
looking at a screen showing the  EMACS  tutorial.  Let's assume that you want to
move to the fang.txt buffer. Enter:

^XX next-buffer        ^XX ___________

This command moves you to the next buffer. Because EMACS  cycles through                                      ____
the  buffer list, which is alphabetized, you will now be in the fang.txt buffer.                                                                fang.txt
Using ^XX again places you in the publish.txt buffer. If you  are  on  a machine      ^XX                         publish.txt         __ ___  ___  __  _ _______

buffer. Using ^XX one last time cycles you back to the beginning of the list.______        ^XX

If you have a large number of buffers to deal with, this cycling process
may  be  slow and inconvenient. The command  ^XB  select-buffer  allows  you  to                                             ^XB  _____________
specify  the  buffer you wish to be switched to. When the  command  is  entered,
EMACS prompts, "Use buffer:".  Simply enter the buffer name (NOT the file name),


27MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                              Buffers


and that buffer will then  become the current buffer. If you type in part of the
file name and  press the space bar, EMACS will attempt to complete the name from
the list of current buffers.  If it succeeds, it will print the rest of the name
and you can hit <NL> to switch to that buffer. If EMACS beeps the bell, there is
no such buffer, and you may continue editing the name on the command line.

Multiple buffer manipulation and editing  is a complex activity, and you
will probably find it very inconvenient to re-save each buffer as you modify it.
The command ^X^B list-buffers creates a new window that gives details  about all            ^X^B ____________
the  buffers  currently known to EMACS. Buffers  that  have  been  modified  are
identified by the "buffer changed" indicator (an asterisk in the second column).
You can thus  quickly and easily identify buffers that need to be saved to files
before  you exit EMACS. The buffer window also  provides  other  information  --
buffer  specific  modes,  buffer size, and buffer name are also listed. To close
this window, simply type the close-windows command, ^X1.                                                    ^X1

To  delete  any  buffer, type ^XK delete-buffer. EMACS prompts you "Kill                                      ^XK _____________
buffer:".  Enter  the  buffer name you want to delete. As  this  is  destructive
command,  EMACS  will  ask for confirmation if the buffer was  changed  and  not
saved.  Answer Y(es) or N(o). As usual ^G cancels the command.                                       ^G

 Modes                                     Modes


EMACS allows you to change the way it works in order to customized it to
the  style  of  editing  you  are using. It does this by providing a  number  of
different  modes.  These  modes can effect either a single buffer,  or  any  new           modes
buffer that is created.  To add a mode to the current buffer, type ^XM add-mode.                                                                   ^XM ________
EMACS will then prompt you for the name of a  mode  to  add.  When you type in a
legal mode name, and type a <NL>, EMACS will add the mode name  to  the  list of
current mode names in the mode line of the current buffer.

To remove an existing mode, typing the ^X^M delete-mode will cause EMACS                                               ^X^M ___________
to  prompt  you for the name of a mode to delete from the current  buffer.  This
will remove that mode from the mode list on the current mode line.

Global modes are the modes which are inherited by any new  buffers which
are  created.  For  example,  if  you  wish  to always do string searching  with
character  case being significant, you would want global mode EXACT to be set so
that any new files read in inherent the EXACT mode. Global  modes  are  set with
the  M-M add-global-mode command, and unset  with  the  M-^M  delete-global-mode     M-M _______________                                M-^M  __________________
command. Also,  the  current  global  modes are displayed in the first line of a
^X^B list-buffers command.^X^B ____________

On  machines  which  are capable of displaying colors, the mode commands
can also set the  background  and foreground character colors. Using add-mode or                                                                     ________
delete-mode with a lowercase color will set the background color in  the current___________
window.  An uppercase color will set the foreground color in the current window.
Colors  that EMACS knows about are: white, cyan,  magenta,  yellow,  blue,  red,
green, and black. If the computer you are running on does not have eight colors,
EMACS will attempt  to make some intelligent guess at what color to use when you
ask for one which is not there.

8.1  ASAVE mode8.1  ASAVE mode

Automatic Save mode tells EMACS to automatically write  out  the current
buffer to its associated file on  a  regular  basis. Normally this will be every
256 characters typed into the file. The environment variable $ACOUNT counts down
to the next auto-save, and $ASAVE is the  value  used  to  reset $ACOUNT after a
save occurs.

8.2  CMODE mode8.2  CMODE mode

CMODE is useful to C programmers.  When  CMODE is active, EMACS will try
to assist the user in  a  number  of  ways.  This mode is set automatically with
files that have a .c or .h extension.


30Modes                                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


The <NL> key will normally attempt to return the user  to  the next line
at the same  level of indentation as the last non blank line, unless the current
line ends with a open brace ({) in which case  the  new  line  will  be  further
indented by one tab position.

A close brace (}) will search for the corresponding open brace  and line
up with it.

A pound sign (#) with only leading white space will delete all the white
space preceding itself. This will  always bring preprocessor directives flush to
the left margin.

Whenever any close fence is typed,  IE  )]>}, if the matching open fence
is on screen in the current window, the  cursor  will  briefly  flash to it, and
then back. This makes balancing expressions, and matching blocks much easier.

8.3  CRYPT mode8.3  CRYPT mode

When a buffer is in CRYPT mode, it is encrypted  whenever  it is written
to a file,  and  decrypted when it is read from the file. The encryption key can
be  specified  on  the  command  line with the -k switch, or with the  M-E  set-                                                                       M-E  ____
encryption-key command. If you attempt to read or write a  buffer  in crypt mode______________
and   now   key   has  not  been  set,  EMACS  will  execute  set-encryption-key                                                              __________________
automatically, prompting you for the needed key.  Whenever EMACS prompts you for
a key, it will not echo the key to your screen  as you type it (IE make SURE you
get it right when you set it originally).

The  encryption  algorithm  used  changes  all  characters  into  normal
printing  characters,  thus  the resulting file  is  suitable  for  sending  via
electronic mail. All version of MicroEMACS should be able decrypt  the resulting
file regardless of what machine encrypted  it.  Also available with EMACS is the
stand  alone program, MicroCRYPT, which can en/decrypt  the  files  produced  by
CRYPT mode in EMACS.

8.4  EXACT mode8.4  EXACT mode

All string searches and replacements  will  take  upper/lower  case into
account.  Normally the case of a string during a search or replace is not  taken
into account.

8.5  MAGIC mode8.5  MAGIC mode

In the MAGIC mode certain characters gain special meanings when  used in
a search  pattern.  Collectively  they  are  know  as regular expressions, and a
limited  number  of  them  are  supported  in  MicroEmacs.  They  grant  greater
flexibility  when  using  the  search  command.  They  have  no  affect  on  the
incremental search command.

The  symbols that have special meaning in MAGIC mode are ^, $, ., &,  ?,
*, +, [ (and ], used with it), and \.



31MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                                Modes


The characters ^ and $ fix the search pattern to  the  beginning and end
of  line,  respectively.  The ^ character must appear at the  beginning  of  the
search  string,  and the $ must appear at the end, otherwise  they  loose  their
meaning and are treated just like any other  character.  For  example,  in MAGIC
mode, searching for the pattern "t$" would put the cursor at the end of any line
that ended with the letter 't'. Note that this is  different  than searching for
"t<NL>", that is, 't' followed by a newline character. The  character  $ (and ^,
for that matter) matches a position, not a character, so  the  cursor remains at
the end of the line.  But a newline is a character that must be matched like any
other character, which means that the cursor is placed just after  it  -  on the
beginning of the next line.

The  character  .  has a very simple meaning -- it  matches  any  single
character, except the newline. Thus a search for "bad.er" could  match "badger",
"badder" (slang), or up to the 'r' of "bad error".

The  character [ indicates the beginning of a  character  class.  It  is
similar to  the  'any'  character  ., but you get to choose which characters you
want to match. The character class is ended with the character  ].  So,  while a
search for "ba.e" will match "bane", "bade", "bale", "bate", et cetera,  you can
limit it to matching "babe" and "bake" by searching for  "ba[bk]e".  Only one of
the characters inside the [ and ] will match a character. If in fact you want to
match any character except those  in the character class, you can put a ^ as the
first character. It must be  the first character of the class, or else it has no
special meaning. So, a search for [^aeiou] will  match  any  character  except a
vowel, but a search for [aeiou^] will match any vowel or a ^.

If you have  many  characters  in  order,  that  you  want to put in the
character class, you may use a dash (-)  as  a  range  character. So, [a-z] will
match any letter (or any lower case letter if EXACT mode  is  on),  and [0-9a-f]
will match  any  digit  or  any  letter  'a' through 'f', which happen to be the
characters for hexadecimal  numbers. If the dash is at the beginning or end of a
character class, it is taken to be just a dash.

The ? character indicates that  the preceding character is optional. The
character may or may not appear in the matched string. For example, a search for
"bea?st" would match both "beast" and "best". If there is no  preceding charcter
for ? to modify, it is treated as a normal question mark character.

The * character  is known as closure, and means that zero or more of the
preceding character will match. If there is no preceding character,
* has no special meaning  and  is  treated  as  a  normal  asterisk. The
closure symbol will  also  have  no  special  meaning  if  it is preceded by the
beginning of line symbol ^, since it represents a position, not a character.

The notion of  zero  or  more  characters is important. If, for example,
your cursor was on the line

 This line is missing two vowels.




32Modes                                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


and a search was made for "a*", the cursor would not move, because it is
guaranteed  to  match  no letter 'a' , which satisfies the search conditions. If
you  wanted  to search for one or more of the letter 'a', you could  search  for
"aa*", which would match the  letter a, then zero or more of them. A better way,
however, is to use the + character.

The + character behaves in every respect like the * character,  with the
exception that its minimum match range is one, not zero.  Thus  the pattern "a+"
is identical to "aa*".

Under  older  versions  of  MicroEMACS,  the closure symbols  would  not
operate on newlines. The current versions no longer have this restriction.

The \ is the escape character.  With  the exception of groups, which are
explained below, the \ is used at those times when you want to be in MAGIC mode,
but also want a regular expression  character  to  be just a character. It turns
off the special meaning of the character. So a search for "it\." will search for
a line with "it.", and not "it" followed by any other  character.  Or,  a search
for "TEST\*+" would match the word TEST followed by one  or  more asterisks. The
escape character will also let  you put ^, -, or ] inside a character class with
no special side effects.

The character pair \( represent the start of a group in a search string.
A group is  ended by the character pair \). All characters matched within the \(
and \)  are  part  of  a  numbered  group, and may be referenced with the &GROUP
function, or with  a \ followed by the group number in the replacement string of
replace-string or the  query-replace-string  commands. For example, a search for______________         ____________________
"INDEX\([0-9]+\)", to be replaced by "getind(\1)" would change

 indptr := INDEX42

 to

 indptr := getind(42)

.

There may be up to nine groups. Groups may be nested.

The character &  (ampersand)  is a replacement character, and represents
all the characters which were matched by the search string.  When used in the M-                                                                              M-
R replace-string or  the  M-^R  query-replace-string  commands,  the  &  will beR ______________          M-^R  ____________________
substituted for the search string.

8.6  OVER mode8.6  OVER mode

OVER mode stands for overwrite mode. When in this mode,  when characters
are typed, instead of simply inserting them into the file, EMACS will attempt to
overwrite  an  existing  character  past  the  point.   This is very useful  for
adjusting tables and diagrams.



33MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                                Modes


8.7  WRAP mode8.7  WRAP mode

Wrap mode is used when typing in continuous text. Whenever the cursor is
past the currently set fill column (72 by default) and the user types a space or
a <NL>, the last word of the line is brought down to the beginning  of  the next
line.  Using  this,  one just types a  continuous  stream  of  words  and  EMACS
automatically inserts <NL>s at appropriate places.

NOTE to programmers:

 The EMACS variable $wraphook contains the name of  the  function which
 executes when  EMACS  detects  it  is time to wrap. This is set to the
 function  wrap-word  by  default,  but  can  be  changed  to  activate               _________
 different functions and macros at wrap time.

8.8  VIEW mode8.8  VIEW mode

VIEW mode disables all  commands  which  can  change the current buffer.
EMACS will display  an error message and ring the bell every time you attempt to
change a buffer in VIEW mode.

 Chapter 9                                   Chapter 9

 Files                                     Files


A file is simply a collection of related data. In  EMACS  we are dealing
with  text files -- named collections of text residing on a disk (or some  other
storage  medium).  You  will recall that the major entities EMACS deals with are
buffers. Disk-based versions  of  files  are  only  active in EMACS when you are
reading into  or  writing  out  of buffers. As we have already seen, buffers and
physical  files are linked by associated file names.  For  example,  the  buffer
"ch7.txt" which is associated with the physical disk file  "ch7.txt."  You  will
notice that the file is usually specified by the drive name or (in the case of a
hard drive) a path. Thus you can specify full file names in EMACS,

e.g. disk:\directories\filename.extension

If you do not specify a disk and directories, the  default  disk and the
current directory is used.

IMPORTANT -- If you do not  explicitly  save  your buffer to a file, all
your edits  will  be  lost  when you leave EMACS (although EMACS will prompt you
when you are  about  to  lose  edits  by  exiting).  In addition, EMACS does not
protect your disk-based files from overwriting  when  it saves files.  Thus when
you instruct EMACS to  save  a  file  to  disk,  it  will  create  a file if the
specified file doesn't exist, or it will overwrite the previously  saved version
of the file thus replacing it. Your old version is gone forever.

If you are at all unsure about your edits, or if  (for  any  reason) you
wish  to  keep  previous versions of a file, you can  change  the  name  of  the
associated file with the  command  ^XN change-file-name. When this file is saved                                   ^XN ________________
to  disk, EMACS will create a new physical file under the new name. The  earlier
disk file will be preserved.

For example, let's load the file fang.txt into EMACS. Now, type ^XN. The                                         fang.txt                       ^XN
EMACS command line prompts "Name:". Enter a new name for the file -- say new.txt                                                                         new.txt
and press <NL>. The file will be saved  under  the  new  filename, and your disk
directory will show both fang.txt and new.txt.                         fang.txt     new.txt

An  alternative method is to write the file directly to disk under a new
filename. Let's pull our "publish.txt" file into EMACS. To write this file under
another filename, type ^X^W  write-file.  EMACS  will  prompt you "write file:".                       ^X^W  __________
Enter  an  alternate  filename -- desktop.txt. Your file will be  saved  as  the                                  desktop.txt
physical file "desktop.txt".

Note that in the examples above, although you have changed the  names of
the  related files, the buffer names remain the same. However, when you pull the


36Files                                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


physical file back into EMACS, you will find that the buffer name now relates to
the filename.

For example -- You are working with a buffer "fang.txt" with the related
file "fang.txt". You change the name of the file to  "new.txt".  EMACS now shows
you working with the buffer "fang.txt" and the related file "new.txt".  Now pull
the file "new.txt" into EMACS. Notice  that  the  buffer name has now changed to
"new.txt".

If for any reason a conflict  of  buffer names occurs,(if you have files
of the  same  name  on  different drives for example) EMACS will prompt you "use
buffer:". Enter an alternative buffer name if you need to.

For a list of file related commands (including some we`ve already seen),
see the summary page.

10.1  Wrapping Text10.1  Wrapping Text


As we learned in the introduction, EMACS is not a word processor, but an
editor. Some simple formatting options are available however,  although  in most
cases they will not affect the appearance of the finished text  when  it  is run
through the formatter. We  have  already encountered WRAP mode which wraps lines
longer  than  a  certain length (default is 75 characters). You will recall that
WRAP is enabled by entering ^XM and responding to the  command  line prompt with                            ^XM
wrap.wrap

You can also set your own wrap margin  with  the  command  ^XF set-fill-                                                                   ^XF _________
column.  Notice  EMACS  responds "[Fill column is 1]." Now try typing some text.______
You'll notice some very strange things happening --  your  text  wraps  at every
word!! This effect occurs because the  set  wrap margin command must be preceded
by  a  numeric  argument or EMACS sets it to the first column. Thus any text you
type that extends past the first  column  will  wrap at the most convenient line
break.

To reset the  wrap  column  to  72  characters, press the <META> key and                                                                  <META>
enter 72. EMACS will respond "Arg: 72". Now press ^XF. EMACS will respond "[Fill                                                  ^XF
column is 72]". Your text  will again wrap at the margin you've been using up to
this point.

10.2  Reformatting Paragraphs10.2  Reformatting Paragraphs


After  an  intensive  editing  session,  you  may  find  that  you  have
paragraphs containing lines  of  differing lengths. Although this disparity will
not  affect the formatted text, aesthetic and technical  concerns  may  make  it
desirable  to have consistent paragraph blocks on the screen. If you are in WRAP
mode, you can  reformat  a  paragraph  with the command M-Q fill-paragraph. This                                                        M-Q ______________
command 'fills'  the  current  paragraph  reformatting  it  so all the lines are
filled and wrap logically.

10.3  Changing Case10.3  Changing Case


There  may be occasions when you find it necessary to change the case of
the text you've entered. EMACS allows you  to  change  the  case  of  even large
amounts  of  text  with  ease.  Let's  try  and convert  a  few  of  the  office
traditionalists to the joy of word processing. Type in the following text:

 Throw  away  your  typewriter and learn to use a word processor.  Word
 processing  is  relatively  easy  to  learn  and  will  increase  your
 productivity enormously. Enter the Computer  Age and find out just how
 much fun it can be!!

Let's give it a little more impact by capitalizing the first four words.
The first step is to define the region of text just as  you  would  if  you were
doing an extensive deletion. Set the mark at the beginning of the paragraph with
M-<space> set-mark and  move  the  cursor  to the space beyond "typewriter." NowM-<space> ________
enter ^X^U case-region-upper.  Your text should now look like this:      ^X^U _________________

 THROW  AWAY  YOUR  TYPEWRITER and learn to use a word processor.  Word
 processing  is  relatively  easy  to  learn  and  will  increase  your
 productivity enormously. Enter the Computer  Age and find out just how
 much fun it can be!!

If you want to change the text  back  to  lower  case,  type  ^X^L case-                                                                      ^X^L _____
region-lower. You can also capitalize individual words. To  capitalize  the word____________
"fun",  position  the  cursor in front of the word and type M-U case-word-upper.                                                            M-U _______________
The word is now capitalized. To change it ck to lower case, move the cursor back
to the beginning of the word and type M-L case-word-lower.                                      M-L _______________

You may also capitalize  individual  letters  in  EMACS. The command M-C                                                                             M-C
case-word-capitalize capitalizes  the first letter after the point. This command____________________
would normally be issued with the cursor positioned in front of the first letter
of the word you wish to capitalize. If you issue it in the middle of a word, you
can end up with some strAnge looking text.

10.4  Tabs10.4  Tabs


Unless  your  formatter  is instructed to take screen text literally (as
MicroSCRIBE  does  in  the  'verbatim'  environment for example), tabs in  EMACS
generally affect screen formatting only.

When EMACS is first started, it sets the  default  tab  to  every eighth
column. As long as you stay with default, every time you press the tab key a tab
character, ^I is inserted.  This  character,  like  other control characters, is           ^I
invisible -- but it makes a subtle and significant difference  to  your file and
editing.

For example, in default mode, press the tab key and  then  type the word
Test.  "Test" appears at the eighth column. Move your cursor to the beginning ofTest
the  word and delete the backward character. The word doesn't move back just one
character,  but  flushes to the left margin.  The reason for  this  behavior  is
easily explained. In tab default, EMACS inserts a 'real' tab character  when you
press the tab key. This character  is  inserted  at the default position, but NO
SPACES  are  inserted  between the tab character and the margin (or previous tab
character). As you will recall, EMACS only recognizes characters (such as spaces
or letters) and  thus when the tab character is removed, the text beyond the tab
is flushed back to the margin or previous tab mark.


40Screen Formatting                                  MicroEMACS Reference Manual


This  situation  changes  if you alter the  default  configuration.  The
default value may be changed by entering a numeric argument before  pressing the
tab  key. As we saw earlier, pressing the META key and entering a number  allows                                          META
you to specify how EMACS performs a given action. In this case, let's specify an
argument of 10 and hit the tab key.

Now hit the  tab key again and type Test. Notice the word now appears at                                            Test
the tenth column.  Now move to the beginning of the word and delete the backward
character. "Test" moves back by one character.

EMACS behaves  differently in these circumstances because the ^I handle-                                                                      ^I _______
tab function deals with tabbing in two distinct ways. In default  conditions, or___
if the  numeric  argument  of  zero  is  used,  handle-tab  inserts  a  true tab                                                __________
character. If, however, a non-zero  numeric  argument  is  specified, handle-tab                                                                      __________
inserts the correct number of spaces needed to position the  cursor  at the next
specified  tab  position.  It does NOT insert the single tab character and hence
any editing functions should take account of the number of spaces between tabbed
columns.

The distance which a true tab character moves the cursor can be modified
by changing the value of the $hardtab environment variable.  Initially set to 8,
this will determine  how far each tab stop is placed from the previous one. (Use
the ^XA set command to set the value of an environment variable).        ___

Many  times you would like to take text which has been created using the
tab  character  and  change it to use just spaces. The command ^X^D detab-region                                                               ^X^D ____________
changes  any  tabs  in the currently selected region into the  right  number  of
spaces so the text does  not change. This is very useful for times when the file
must be printed or transferred to a machine which does not understand tabs.

Also, the  inverse command, ^X^E entab-region changes multiple spaces to                                    ^X^E ____________
tabs where possible.  This  is a good way to shrink the size of large documents,
especially with data tables. Both of these commands can take a  numeric argument
which will be interpreted as the number of lines to en/detab.

Another function, related  to  those  above  is provided for by the ^X^T                                                                            ^X^T
trim-region when invoked will delete any trailing white space  in  the  selected___________
region. A preceding numeric argument will do this for that number of lines.

 Chapter 10 Summary                               Chapter 10 Summary

In Chapter 10 introduced some of the formatting features of EMACS. Text-
wrap, paragraph reformatting,  and  tabs  were  discussed  in  some  detail. The
commands in the following table were covered in the chapter.

Access to the Outside World                          Access to the Outside World


EMACS has the ability to interface to other programs and the environment
of the  computer  outside  of  itself. It does this through a series of commands
that allow it to talk to  the  computer's  command processor or shell. Just what                                           command processor    shell
this is varies between different computers. Under MSDOS  or  PCDOS  this  is the
command.com command processor.   Under UNIX it is the csh shell. On the Atari STcommand.com                                           csh
is can be the Mark Williams MSH or the Beckmeyer shell. In each case, it  is the                            MSH
part of the computer's operating system that is responsible for determining what
programs are executed, and when.

The ^X! shell-command  command  prompts  the  user for a command line to            ^X! _____________
send  out  to  the shell to execute. This can be  very  useful  for  doing  file
listings and changing the current directory or folder. EMACS  gives  control  to
the shell, which executed the command,  and  then  types [END] and waits for the                                                         [END]
user  to  type  a character before redrawing the screen and resuming editing. If
the  shell-command  command  is used from within the macro language, there is no     _____________
pause.

^X@ pipe-command command allows EMACS to execute a shell command, and if        ^X@ ____________
the  particular  computer  allows it, send the results into a  buffer  which  is
automatically displayed on the  screen.  The  resulting buffer, called "command"
can be manipulated just like any other editing buffer. Text can be copied out of
it or rearranged as needed. This buffer is originally created  in  VIEW mode, so                                                                   VIEW
remember to ^X^Mview<NL> in order to change it.            ^X^Mview<NL>

Many computers provide tools which will allow you to filter text, making                                                             filter
some  modifications to it along the way. A very common tool is the SORT  program                                                                   SORT
which accepts a file, sorts it,  and  prints  the result out. The EMACS command,
^X# filter-buffer sends the current buffer through such a filter.  Therefore, if^X# _____________
you wished to  sort the current buffer on a system which supplied a sort filter,
you would  type  ^X#sort<NL>.    You can also create your own filters by writing                 ^X#sort<NL>
programs  and  utilities  which  read  text  from  the  keyboard and display the
results.  EMACS will use any of these which would normally be available from the
current shell.

If  you  would  like  to  execute another program directly, without  the
overhead of an intervening  shell,  you can use the ^X$ execute-program command.                                                    ^X$ _______________
It  will  prompt you for an external program and its arguments  and  attempt  to
execute  it.  Like when EMACS looks for command files, EMACS will look first  in
the  HOME  directory,  then down the execute PATH, and finally  in  the  current
directory for the named program. On some systems, it will automatically tack the
proper  extension on the file name to indicate it is a program. On some  systems
that don't support this function, ^X$ will be equivalent to ^X! shell-command.                                  ^X$                       ^X! _____________


43MicroEMACS Reference Manual                          Access to the Outside World


Sometimes, you would like to get back to  the  shell  and  execute other
commands, without losing the current contents of EMACS. The ^XC  i-shell command                                                            ^XC  _______
shells out of EMACS, leaving EMACS in the computer and executing another command

Keyboard Macros                                Keyboard Macros


In many applications, you may need  to  repeat a series of characters or
commands frequently. For example, a paper may require the frequent repetition of
a complex formula  or  a long name. You may also have a series of EMACS commands
that  you  invoke  frequently. Keyboard macros  offer  a  convenient  method  of
recording and repeating these commands.

Imagine, for example, you  are  writing  a  scholarly paper on Asplenium                                                                       _________
platyneuron, the spleenwort fern. Even  the  dedicated  botanist  would probably___________
find  it  a  task bordering on  the  agonizing  to  type  Asplenium  platyneuron                                                          _________  ___________
frequently throughout the paper. An alternative method is 'record' the name in a
keyboard macro. Try it yourself.

The command ^X( begin-macro starts  recording the all the keystrokes and                    ^X( ___________
commands you input. After you've typed it, enter Asplenium platyneuron.  To stop                                                 Asplenium platyneuron
recording, type ^X) end-macro.  EMACS  has stored all the keystrokes between the                ^X) _________
two commands. To repeat the name you've stored, just  enter  ^XE  execute-macro,                                                             ^XE  _____________
and  the name "Asplenium platyneuron" appears. You can  repeat  this  action  as
often as you  want,  and of course as with any EMACS command, you may precede it
with a numerical argument to repeat it many times.

Because EMACS records  keystrokes,  you may freely intermix commands and
text. Unfortunately, you  can only store one macro at a time. Thus, if you begin
to record another macro, the previously defined macro  is  lost.  Be  careful to
ensure that you've finished with one macro before defining another. If  you have
a series of commands that you would like  to  'record'  for  future use, use the
procedure facilities detailed in chapter 13.

Procedures,  or  macros,  are  programs  that are used to customize  the
editor  and to perform complicated editing tasks. They may be stored in files or
buffers  and  may  be executed using an  appropriate  command,  or  bound  to  a
particular keystroke. Portions of the standard start-up file are implemented via
procedures, as  well  as  the  built in help system. The M-^E run command causes                                                         M-^E ___
named procedures to be executed. The execute-file command allows you  to execute                                     ____________
a  procedure stored in a disk file, and the execute-buffer command allows you to                                            ______________
execute a procedure stored in a buffer. Procedures are stored for easy execution
by executing files that contain the store-procedure command.

In a command file, the store-procedure command takes  a  string argument                               _______________
which is the name of a procedure to store. These procedures than can be executed
with the M-^E run command. Also,  giving  the  name of a stored procedure within         M-^E ___
another procedure will executed that named procedure as if it had been called up
with the run command.         ___

Some  fairly length examples of MicroEMACS procedures  can  be  seen  by
examining the standard  files  that  come  with EMACS. The emacs.rc file (called                                                           emacs.rc
.emacsrc)  under UNIX) is the MicroEMACS command file  which  is  executed  when.emacsrc
EMACS is normally run. It contains a number of different stored procedures along
with the lines to setup and display the Function key window and to call up other
procedures and command files using function keys.

There  are many different aspects to  the  language  within  MicroEMACS.
Editor commands are the various commands that manipulate text, buffers, windows,
et cetera, within the  editor.  Directives are commands which control what lines
get  executed  within  a macro. Also  there  are  various  types  of  variables.
Environmental  variables both control and report on  different  aspects  of  the
editor. User variables hold string values which may be  changed  and  inspected.
Buffer  variables  allow  text to be placed into variables. Interactive variable
allow the program to prompt the user for information. Functions  can  be used to
manipulate all these variables.

13.1  Constants13.1  Constants


All constants and variable contents in EMACS are stored  as  strings  of
characters. Numbers are stored  digit  by digit as characters. This allows EMACS
to be "typeless",  not  having  different  variables types be legal in different
contexts. This has the disadvantage of forcing the user to be more careful about
the context of the statements variables  are  placed  in, but in turn gives them



48MicroEMACS Procedures                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


more flexibility in where they can  place  variables. Needless to say, this also
allows EMACS's expression evaluator to be both concise and quick.

Wherever  statements  need  to have arguments,  it  is  legal  to  place
constants.  A  constant  is a double quote character, followed by  a  string  of
characters,  and  terminated  by another double quote  character.  To  represent
various special characters within  a  constant, the tilde (~) character is used.
The  character following the tilde is interpreted  according  to  the  following
table:

Sequence        Result________        ______
~n                      EMACS newline character (breaks lines)
~r              ^M      carriage return
~l              ^J      linefeed
~~              ~       tilde
~b              ^H      backspace
~f              ^L      formfeed
~t              ^I      tab
~"              "       quote

Any character not  in  the  table  which  follows a tilde will be passed
unmodified. This action is similar to the ^Q  quote-character  command available                                          ^Q  _______________
from the keyboard.

EMACS may use different characters  for  line  terminators  on different
computers. The ~n  combination  will  always  get  the  proper  line terminating
sequence for the current system.

The double quotes  around  constants  are  not  needed  if  the constant
contains  no internal white space and it also does not happen to meet the  rules
for  any  other  EMACS  commands,  directives, variables, or functions. This  is
reasonable useful for numeric constants.

13.2  Variables13.2  Variables


Variables in MicroEMACS procedures can be used to  return  values within
expressions, as repeat counts to editing commands, or  as  text  to  be inserted
into buffers and messages. The value of these variables is set using the set ^XA                                                                             ^XA
command.  For  example,  to set the current fill column to  64  characters,  the
following macro line would be used:

set $fillcol 64

or to have the contents of  %name  inserted  at the point in the current                                    %name
buffer, the command to use would be:

insert-string %name

$diagflag          If set to TRUE,  diagonal  dragging of text and mode lines is
 enabled. If FALSE, text and  modelines  can  only  be dragged
 horizontally or vertically at one time.

$discmd            Controls the echoing of command prompts. Default is TRUE.

$disinp            Controls the echoing of input at the command prompts. Default
 is TRUE.

$disphigh          If set to TRUE, high-bit characters  (single  byte characters
 that are greater than 127 in value) will be  displayed  in  a
 pseudo-control format. The characters "^!" will lead  off the
 sequence, followed by the character stripped of its high bit.
 Default is FALSE.

$exbhook           This variable holds the name of a function or macro  which is
 run whenever you are switching out of a buffer.

 be used to change indentation only within the editor.

$hjump             The number in here tells EMACS how many columns to scroll the
 screen horizontally when a horizontal scroll is required.

$hscroll           This flag  determines if EMACS will scroll the entire current
 window horizontally, or just the  current  line.  The default
 value, TRUE,  results  in  the  entire  current  window being
 shifted left and right  when  the cursor goes off the edge of
 the screen.

$kill              This contains  the first 127 characters currently in the kill
 buffer  and  can be used to set  the  contents  of  the  kill
 buffer.

52MicroEMACS Procedures                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


$progname          [READ  ONLY]Always  contains  the  string   "MicroEMACS"  for
 standard MicroEMACS. Could  be  something  else  if  EMACS is
 incorporated as part of someone else's program.

$ram                The amount of  remaining  memory  if MicroEMACS was compiled
 with RAMSIZE set. A debugging tool.

$readhook          This  variable  holds  the  name  of  a  function to  execute
 whenever  a  file  is read into EMACS.  Normally,  using  the
 standard emacs.rc file, this is  bound  to  a  function which                            emacs.rc
 places EMACS into CMODE if the extension of the file  read is
 .c or .h.

$region            Contains the string  of  the current region. It will truncate
 at the stringsize limit, 255.

$replace           Current default replace string.

$rval              This contains the return value from the last subprocess which
 was invoked from EMACS.

$scrname           The current screen name.

$search            Current default search string.

$searchpnt         Set the placement of the of the cursor on a successful search
 match. $searchpnt = 0 (the  default), causes the cursor to be
 placed  at  the  end of the matched text on forward searches,
 and  at  the  beginning  of  the  text  on reverse  searches.
 $searchpnt  = 1 causes the cursor to be  placed  at  the  the
 beginning  of  the  matched  text  regardless  of  the search
 direction,  while  $searchpnt  = 2 causes the  cursor  to  be
 placed at the end.

$seed              Integer seed of the random number generator.

$softtab           Number  of  spaces  inserted  by  EMACS  when  the handle-tab
 command (which is normally bound to the TAB key) is invoked.

$sres              Current screen resolution (CGA, MONO,  EGA or VGA on the IBM-
 PC  driver.  LOW,  MEDIUM, HIGH or DENSE on the Atari ST1040,
 NORMAL on most others).

$ssave             If TRUE, when  EMACS  is  asked  to save the current file, it
 writes  all  files  out  to  a  temporary  file, deletes  the
 original,  and then renames the temporary  to  the  old  file
 name. The default value of this is TRUE.

$sscroll           Changes EMACS, when  set  to TRUE, to smoothly scroll windows
 (one line  at  a  time)  when  cursoring  off the ends of the
 current window.


53MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                MicroEMACS Procedures


$status            [READ ONLY]Status of the success of the last command (TRUE or
 FALSE).  This is usually used with !force  to  check  on  the
 success of a search, or a file operation.

$sterm             This is the character used to terminate search string inputs.
 The default for this is the last key bound to meta-prefix.                                                                 ___________

$target            Current target for line moves (setting this fool's EMACS into
 believing the last command was a line move).

$time              [READ  ONLY]Contains  a  string  corresponding to the current
 date and time. Usually this is in a form similar to  "Mon May
 09 10:10:58 1988". Not  all  operating  systems  will support
 this.

$tpause            Controls the length of the pause to display  a  matched fence
 when the current  buffer  is  in  CMODE and a close fence has
 been typed.

$version           [READ ONLY]Contains the current MicroEMACS version number.

$wchars            When  set, MicroEMACS uses the characters  listed  in  it  to
 determine if it is in a word or not. If it  is  not  set (the
 default), the characters it uses are the upper and lower case
 letters, and the underscore.

$wline             Number of display lines in current window.

$wraphook          This variable contains the name of an EMACS function which is
 executed when a  buffer  is  in  WRAP  mode and it is time to
 wrap. By default this is bound to wrap-word.                                                     _________

$writehook         This variable contains the name of an EMACS function or macro
 which is invoked whenever EMACS  attempts to write a file out
 to  disk.  This  is  executed  before  the  file is  written,
 allowing you to process a file on the way out.

$xpos              The column the mouse was at the last mouse button press.

$yankflag          Controls the placement of the  cursor after a yank command or
 an insert.  When $yankflag is FALSE (the default), the cursor
 is placed at the end of the yanked or inserted text.  When it
 is TRUE, the cursor remains at the start of the text.

$ypos              The line which the mouse was on during the last  mouse button
 press.

13.2.2  User variables13.2.2  User variables


User variables allow you  to  store  strings  and manipulate them. These
strings can  be  pieces  of  text, numbers (in text form), or the logical values
TRUE and FALSE. These variables can be combined, tested, inserted  into buffers,TRUE     FALSE
and otherwise used  to control the way your macros execute. At the moment, up to
512  user  variables may be in use in one editing session.  All  users  variable
names  must  begin  with  a  percent  sign  (%) and  may  contain  any  printing
characters. Only the first 10  characters are significant (IE differences beyond
the  tenth character are ignored). Most operators will  truncate  strings  to  a
length of 128 characters.


13.2.3  Buffer Variables13.2.3  Buffer Variables


Buffer variables are special in that they can only be queried and cannot
be set. What buffer variables are is a way to take text from a buffer  and place
it in a variable. For example, if I have a  buffer by the name of RIGEL2, and it
contains the text:

Richmond
Lafayette
<*>Bloomington          (where <*> is the current point)
Indianapolis
Gary
=* MicroEMACS 3.11 (WRAP) == rigel2 == File: /data/rigel2.txt =====

and within a command I reference #rigel2, like:

insert-string #rigel2

MicroEMACS would start  at  the  current  point in the RIGEL2 buffer and
grab all the text up to the end of that  line  and pass that back. Then it would
advance the point  to  the  beginning  of  the  next  line. Thus, after our last
command  executes,  the  string  "Bloomington"  gets inserted into  the  current
buffer, and the buffer RIGEL2 now looks like this:

Richmond
Lafayette
Bloomington
<*>Indianapolis         (where <*> is the current point)
Gary
=* MicroEMACS 3.11 (WRAP) == rigel2 == File: /data/rigel2.txt =====

as you have probably  noticed,  a buffer variable consists of the buffer
name, preceded by a pound sign (#).

13.2.4  Interactive variables13.2.4  Interactive variables


Interactive variables are  actually  a  method  to prompt the user for a
string. This  is  done  by  using  an  at sign (@) followed either with a quoted
string, or a variable containing a string.  The  string  is  the  placed  on the
bottom  line,  and the editor waits for the user to type in a string.  Then  the
string  typed  in  by  the  users  is returned as the value of  the  interactive
variable. For example:

set %quest "What file? "
find-file @%quest

will ask the user for a file name,  and  then  attempt  to find it. Note
also that complex expressions can be built up with these operators, such as:

set %default "file1"
@&cat &cat "File to decode[" %default "]: "

which prompts the user with the string:

File to decode[file1]:

13.3  Functions13.3  Functions


Functions  can  be  used to act on variables in various ways.  Functions
can have one, two, or three arguments. These  arguments  will  always  be placed
after the  function  on  the  current command line. For example, if we wanted to
increase the current fill column by two, using  emacs's  set  (^XA)  command, we
would write:

set $fillcol &add $fillcol 2
 \      \      \      \     \____second operand
\      \      \      \_________first operand
 \      \      \_______________function to execute
\      \_____________________variable to set
 \___________________________set (^XA) command

Function  names  always  begin with the ampersand (&) character, and are
only  significant  to  the first three characters after the ampersand. Functions
will normal  expect  one  of  three  types  of arguments, and will automatically
convert types when needed. Different argument types include:

<num>              an ascii string of digits which is interpreted  as  a numeric
 value.  Any string which does not start  with  a  digit  or a
 minus sign (-) will be considered zero.

<str>              An arbitrary string of characters. At the moment, strings are
 limited to 128 characters in length.


56MicroEMACS Procedures                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


<log>              A logical value  consisting  of the string "TRUE" or "FALSE".
 Numeric strings will also evaluate  to  "FALSE"  if  they are
 equal to zero, and "TRUE"  if  they  are  non-zero. Arbitrary
 text strings will have the value of "FALSE".

A  list  of  the currently available functions  follows.  Functions  are
always used in lower case, the uppercase letters in the  function  table are the
short form of the function (IE &div for &divide).

TRUE.
&GREater        <num1> <num2>   If <num1> is greater than, or equal to
<num2>, return TRUE.
&SEQual         <str1> <str2>   If the two strings are the same, return
TRUE.
&SLEss          <str1> <str2>   If <str1> is less alphabetically than

&EXIst          <str>           Does the named file <str> exist?

&ISNum          <num>           Is the given argument a legitimate number?

Special Functions:

&GROup          <num>           Return group <num> as set by a MAGIC
mode search.

&SUPper         <str1> <str2>   Translate the first char in <str1> to
the first char in <str2> when uppercasing.

&SLOwer         <str1> <str2>   Translate the first char in <str1> to
the first char in <str2> when lowercasing.

&INDirect       <str>           Evaluate <str> as a variable.

This  last  function  deserves  more  explanation.  The   &IND  function
evaluates its argument, takes the  resulting  string,  and  then  uses  it  as a
variable name. For example, given the following code sequence:

; set up reference table


58MicroEMACS Procedures                              MicroEMACS Reference Manual


set %one        "elephant"
set %two        "giraffe"
set %three      "donkey"

set %index "two"
insert-string &ind %index

the  string  "giraffe" would have been inserted  at  the  point  in  the
current buffer. This indirection can be safely nested up to about 10 levels.

13.4  Directives13.4  Directives


Directives  are  commands  which  only  operate   within   an  executing
procedure,  IE they do not make sense as a single command. As such, they  cannot
be  called  up  singly or bound to keystroke. Used within  command  files,  they
control what lines are executed and in what order.

Directives always start with the exclamation mark (!) character and must
be the first non-wite space placed on a line. Directives  executed interactively
(via the execute-command-line command) will be ignored.


13.4.1  !ENDM Directive13.4.1  !ENDM Directive


This directive is used  to  terminate a procedure or macro being stored.
For example, if a file is being executed contains the text:

;       Read in a file in view mode, and make the window red

store-procedure get-red-viewed-file
find-file @"File to view: "
add-mode "view"
add-mode "red"
!endm

print "[Consult procedure has been loaded]"

only the lines between the store-macro command and  the  !ENDM directive
are stored in  procedure  get-red-viewd-file. Both named procedures and numbered
macroes (via the store-macro command) should be terminated with this directive.                 ___________


13.4.2  !FORCE Directive13.4.2  !FORCE Directive


When  MicroEMACS  executes  a  procedure,  if  any  command  fails,  the
procedure  is  terminated  at  that  point.  If a line is preceded by  a  !FORCE
directive, execution continues whether the command succeeds or not. For example:



59MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                MicroEMACS Procedures


;       Merge the top two windows

save-window             ;remember what window we are at
1 next-window           ;go to the top window
delete-window           ;merge it with the second window
!force restore-window   ;This will continue regardless
add-mode "red"
Often this is used  together  with  the  $status environment variable to
test if a command succeeded. For example:

set %seekstring "String to Find: "
!force search-forward %seekstring
!if &seq $status TRUE
print "Your string is Found"
!else
print "No such STRING!"
!endif


13.4.3  !IF, !ELSE, and !ENDIF Directives13.4.3  !IF, !ELSE, and !ENDIF Directives


This  directive allows statements only to be  executed  if  a  condition
specified in the directive is met. Every line following the !IF directive, until
the  first  !ELSE  or !ENDIF directive,  is  only  executed  if  the  expression
following  the  !IF  directive evaluates to  a  TRUE  value.  For  example,  the
following commands creates  the  portion  of  a  text  file  automatically. (yes
believe me, this will be easier to understand then that last explanation....)

!if &sequal %curplace "timespace vortex"
insert-string "First, rematerialize~n"
!endif
!if &sequal %planet "earth"     ;If we have landed on earth...
!if &sequal %time "late 20th century"  ;and we are then
write-message "Contact U.N.I.T."
!else
insert-string "Investigate the situation....~n"
insert-string "(SAY 'stay here Sara')~n"
!endif
!else
set %conditions @"Atmosphere conditions outside? "
!if &sequal %conditions "safe"
insert-string &cat "Go outside......" "~n"
insert-string "lock the door~n"
!else
insert-string "Dematerialize..try somewhen else"
newline
!endif
!endif

13.4.4  !GOTO Directive13.4.4  !GOTO Directive


Flow can be controlled  within  a  MicroEMACS  procedure using the !GOTO
directive. It takes  as an argument a label. A label consists of a line starting
with  an  asterisk  (*) and then an  alphanumeric  label.  Only  labels  in  the
currently executing  procedure  can  be  jumped to, and trying to jump to a non-
existing label terminates execution of a procedure. For example:

;Create a block of DATA statements for a BASIC program

insert-string "1000 DATA "
set %linenum 1000

*nxtin
update-screen           ;make sure we see the changes
set %data @"Next number: "
!if &equal %data 0
!goto finish
!endif

!if &greater $curcol 60
2 delete-previous-character
newline
set %linenum &add %linenum 10
insert-string &cat %linenum " DATA "
!endif

insert-string &cat %data ", "
!goto nxtin

*finish

2 delete-previous-character
newline


13.4.5  !WHILE and !ENDWHILE Directives13.4.5  !WHILE and !ENDWHILE Directives


This  directive  allows  you  to  set  up  repetitive tasks  easily  and
efficiently. If a group of  statements  need  to  be  executed  while  a certain
condition is true, enclose them with a while loop. For example,

!while &less $curcol 70
insert-string &cat &cat "[" #stuff "]"
!endwhile

places items from buffer "item" in the current line until the  cursor is
at or past column 70. While loops may be nested  and  can  contain  and  be  the


61MicroEMACS Reference Manual                                MicroEMACS Procedures


targets of !GOTOs  with no ill effects. Using a while loop to enclose a repeated
task will run much faster than the corresponding construct using !IFs.


13.4.6  !BREAK Directive13.4.6  !BREAK Directive


This  lets you abort out of the most  executing  currently  inner  while
loop, regardless of  the  condition.  It  is  often used to abort processing for
error conditions. For example:

;       Read in files and substitute "begining" with "beginning"

set %filename #list
!while &not &seq %filename "<end>"
!force          find-file %filename
!if &seq $status FALSE
write-message "[File read error]"
!break
!endif
beginning-of-file
replace-string "begining" "beginning"
save-file
set %filename #list
!endwhile

This while loop will process files until the list is exhausted  or there
is an error while reading a file.


13.4.7  !RETURN Directive13.4.7  !RETURN Directive


The  !RETURN  Directive  causes the current procedure  to  exit,  either
returning to the caller (if any) or to interactive mode. For example:

;       Check the monitor type and set %mtyp

!if &sres "CGA"
set %mtyp 1
!return
!else
set %mtyp 2
!endif

insert-string "You are on a MONOCHROME machine!~n"

Debugging MicroEMACS Procedures                        Debugging MicroEMACS Procedures


When  developing new procedures, it is very convenient  to  be  able  to
trace  their  execution  to  discover  errors. The $debug  environment  variable
enables procedure debugging.  While  this  variable  is TRUE, emacs will stop at
each line it intends to execute and allow you to view it, and issue a  number of
different commands to help determine how the procedure is executing.

For example, we  will  step  through  the  procedure  which  toggles the
function key window off. The  first thing to do, is to set $debug, using the ^XA                                                                             ^XA
set  command.  Type  ^XA  and  emacs  will prompt you on the command  line  with___
"Variable  to set: ". Type in "$debug" and press the enter key. Emacs will  then
ask "Value: ". Type in "TRUE" (in capital letters) and press the enter key.

While macro debugging is enabled (as  it  is now) emacs will report each
time a variable is assigned a value, by displaying the variable and its value on
the command line. Right now,

((($debug <- TRUE)))

appears  on  the  command  line  to  tell  you that $debug now has  been
assigned the value of TRUE. Press the space bar to continue.

Now, lets try  to  debug  a  macro.  Press function key 5 which normally
toggles the function key window. The first thing that appears is:

<<<[Macro 01]:!if %rcfkeys>>>

At this point,  emacs is waiting for a command. It is prepared to see if
the  user variable %rcfkeys is TRUE, and execute some lines if they are. Suppose
we  want  to  see the value of this variable, type the letter "e" to evaluate an
expression. Emacs will prompt with "EXP: ".   Type  "%rcfkeys"  followed  by the
enter key. Emacs should then respond  with  "TRUE" to indicate that the function
key window is currently on screen.

Press the space bar to allow the !if directive to  execute.   Emacs will
decide that it is TRUE, and then display the next command to execute.

<<<[Macro 01]:!goto rcfoff>>>

Notice emacs tells us what procedure we are currently executing (in this
case, the macro bound to execute-macro-1). Press the space bar again  to execute
the !goto directive.



63MicroEMACS Reference Manual                      Debugging MicroEMACS Procedures


<<<[Macro 01]:save-window>>>

Emacs is saving the position  of  the  current  window  so  that  it can
attempt to return to it after it has brought up the function key window.

64Key Bindings, What they are and why                MicroEMACS Reference Manual






 Chapter 15                                   Chapter 15

Key Bindings, What they are and why                      Key Bindings, What they are and why


One of the features which makes MicroEMACS very adaptable is its ability
to use different  keystrokes  to  execute  different  commands.  The  process of
changing the particular command  a  key invokes is called rebinding. This allows                                                          _________
us to make the editor look like other popular editors and programs.

Each  command  in  MicroEMACS has a  name  which  is  used  for  binding
purposes. For example, the command to  move  the  cursor down one page is called
next-line and is normally bound  to  the  ^N  key.  If you decided that you also_________
wanted to use the ^D key to move the cursor down one line, you would use the M-K
bind-to-key command. EMACS would respond with ": bind-to-key "  on  the  command___________
line and allow you to type in a command name.  Then  type  in  the  name  of the
command   you want to change, in this case next-line, followed by the <NL>  key.                                           _________
EMACS will then wait for you to type in the keys you want to activate  the named
function. Type a single ^D. From now on, typing ^D will cause EMACS to move down
one line, rather than its original function of deleting characters.

To find out the name of a  command,  consult  the  list  of  valid EMACS
commands in Appendix B. Also, you can use the ^X?  describe-key  command to look                                                   ____________
up the name of a command. Type ^X? and then the key  to  use  that  command, and
EMACS will show you the name of the command.

After you have experimented  with  changing  your  key bindings, you may
decide that you want to change  some  bindings permanently. To have EMACS rebind
keys  to your pleasure each time you start EMACS, you can add statements to  the
end of your startup file (emacs.rc or .emacsrc  depending  on  the  system). For                          emacs.rc    .emacsrc
example,

bind-to-key next-line ^D

Notice,  that control D character in the  startup  file  is  represented
visibly as an uparrow key  followed by a capital D. To know how to represent any
keys you want to bind,  use  the  describe-key  command  on the key, and use the                                  ____________
sequence that is displayed.

bind-to-key split-current-window FN1

This example would make function key 1 activate the command  that splits
the current window in two.

EMACS will let you define  a  large  number  of  keys,  but  will report
"Binding table FULL!" when it runs out of space to bind  keys.  Normally   EMACS



65MicroEMACS Reference Manual                  Key Bindings, What they are and why


will  allow  up  to 512 key bindings (including approx. 300  originally    bound
keys).

If you want to get a current listing of all the  commands  and  the keys
bound to them, use  the  describe-bindings command. Notice, that this command is                         _________________
not bound to any keys!

 MicroEMACS Command Line Switches and Startup Files               MicroEMACS Command Line Switches and Startup Files


When  EMACS  first  executes, it always  searches  for  a  file,  called
.emacsrc under most UNIX systems or emacs.rc on most other systems which it will.emacsrc _____ ____ ____ _______    emacs.rc __ ____ _____ _______
execute as  EMACS  macros  before  it reads in the named source files. This file
normally contains EMACS macroes to bind the function keys  to  useful  functions
and load various useful macros. The contents of  this  file  will  probably vary
from system to system and can be modified by the user as desired.

When  searching for this file, EMACS looks for it in this order.  First,
it attempts to  find a definition for "HOME" in the environment. It will look in                                       HOME
that directory first. Then it searches all the directories listed in  the "PATH"                                                                           PATH
environment variable. Then  it  looks  through  a  list  of  predefined standard
directories which vary from system to system. Finally, failing all of  these, it
looks in the  current directory. This is also the same method EMACS uses to look
up any files to execute, and to find it's help file EMACS.HLP.                                                    EMACS.HLP

On computers that  call  up  EMACS  via  a command line process, such as
MSDOS and UNIX, there are different things that can be added to the command line
to control the way EMACS operates. These can be switches, which are a dash ('-')
followed  by  a  letter,  and  possible  other  parameters,  or  a startup  file
specifier, which is an at sign '@' followed by a file name.

@<file>            This  causes the named file to be  executed  instead  of  the
 standard emacs.rc file before emacs reads in any other files.
 More than one of these can be placed on the command line, and
 they will be executed in the order that they appear.

-C                 The following source files on the command line can be changed
 (as opposed to being in VIEW mode). This is  mainly  used  to
 cancel  the  effects  of the -v switch used previously in the
 same command line.

-E                 This flag  causes emacs to automatically run the startup file
 "error.cmd" instead of emacs.rc.  This  is  used by various C
 compilers for error processing  (for  example,  Mark Williams
 C).

-G<num>            Upon entering EMACS, position the cursor at the <num> line of
 the first file.

-I<var> <value>    Initialize an EMACS variable with <value>. This can be useful
 to force EMACS to start in a particular  mode.  (For example,



67MicroEMACS Reference Manual   MicroEMACS Command Line Switches and Startup Files


 invoke EMACS with "emacs  -i$sres  VGA  foo.bar" to edit file
 foo.bar in VGA 50 line mode on an IBM-PC).

-K<key>            This key tells emacs to place the source files in  CRYPT mode
 and read it in using <key>  as  the encryption key. If no key
 is listed  immediately after the -K switch, EMACS will prompt
 for a key, and not echo it as it is typed.

-R                 This places EMACS in  "restricted  mode"  where  any commands
 allowing the user to  read  or write any files other than the
 ones  listed  on  the  command  line are disabled.  Also  all
 commands allowing the user access to the operating system are
 disabled.  This  makes  EMACS  very   useful   as   a  "safe"
 environment for use  within other applications and especially
 used  as a remote editor for a  BBS  or  electronic  bulletin
 board system.

-S<string>         After  EMACS  is   started,  it  automatically  searches  for
 <string> in the first source file.

-V                 This tells EMACS that all  the following sources files on the
 command  line  should  be in VIEW mode to prevent any changes
 being made to them.






























68Command Completion                                 MicroEMACS Reference Manual

 Command Completion                               Command Completion


Some versions of MicroEMACS will  allow you to abbrieviate buffer names,
command names and  file  names as you enter them. To use this, type in the first
few characters of the name you wish, and then hit either the space bar, the META
key or the TAB key. MicroEMACS will then attempt to look at the list of  all the
availible names and if there is only one  which  will  fit,  it will choose that
name. If there are several names that quailify, as many characters as are common
to ALL of them will  be entered. If there are no possible matches, the bell will
ring to indicate MicroEMACS can not complete the command.

For example, if you have several files in your  current  directory  with
the following names:

prog1.c
prog1.obj
prog1.exe
prog1.doc
program.one
project.one
test.c
tes

and you enter the ^X^F find-file command, if you type  'p'  and then hit                          ^X^F _________
the  space  bar,  EMACS will respond by typing the 'r' that is common to all the
above file names begining with  'p'. If you then type 'ogr' and hit the tab key,
EMACS will respond with 'am.one' and automatically hit the enter key for you.

If you were to instead type an 'a'  and  hit  the  space bar, EMACS will
beep, informing you that there is no possible match.

If you  type  a  'te'  and  hit  the space bar, EMACS will then type the
following 's', but it will not automatically enter it because it is possible you
mean to get to the test.c file.

Buffer name, and command name completion is available in all versions of
MicroEMACS. File name completion is available on UNIX BSD4.3, the Atari  ST, the
AMIGA and under MSDOS.

 Numeric Arguments to Commands                         Numeric Arguments to Commands


In general, preceding a  MicroEMACS  command  with  a numeric argument n                                                                               n
causes the command to be  executed  n  times.    However, there are a great many                                    n
commands for which this has no effect, simply because it would make no sense for
the command to be executed more than once.  There are  also  commands  that take
advantage of the numeric  arguments  to alter their behavior subtly or unsubtly.
The following is a list of these commands.  Commands that  are  not  affected at
all by numeric arguments are listed afterwards.

backward-character
 A negative argument invokes forward-character.                                               _________________

change-screen-size
 With  no  arguments,  the  number  of  rows  defaults to  the
 largest.  Otherwise, set the screen size to n.                                                               n

change-screen-width
 With  no arguments, the number of  columns  defaults  to  the
 largest.  Otherwise, set the screen width to n.                                                                n

clear-and-redraw   With an  argument,  centers  the  window  around  the current
 cursor position.

delete-next-character
 A negative argument invokes delete-previous-character.                                               _________________________

delete-next-word   With  an  argument  of  0,  will  not  delete the  whitespace
 trailing the deleted word.  A  negative  argument  will cause
 nothing to happen.

delete-previous-character
 A negative argument invokes delete-next-character.                                               _____________________

delete-previous-word
 An negative or zero argument will cause nothing to happen.

detab-region       Without an argument, detab-region changes hard tabs to spaces                                        ____________
 in  the  lines between the mark and  the  cursor.    With  an
 argument  n, the commands detab n lines -  forward  if  n  is                             n                     n                       n
 positive, backwards if not.

end-of-word        A negative argument invokes next-word.                                               _________



81MicroEMACS Reference Manual                        Numeric Arguments to Commands


entab-region       Without an argument, entab-region changes spaces to hard tabs                                        ____________
 in  the  lines between the mark and  the  cursor.    With  an
 argument  n, the commands entab n lines -  forward  if  n  is                             n                     n                       n
 positive, backwards if not.

exchange-point-and-mark
 Swap the current cursor position  and mark number n.  Without                                                                     n
 an argument, n defaults to 0.                                n

exit-emacs         Providing a numeric  argument  n causes two things to happen.                                                  n
 First, no  checking for modified buffers will occur.  Second,
 MicroEMACS exits with a status of n.                                                     n

forward-character  A negative argument invokes backward-character.                                               __________________

goto-line          An argument n  will  be  taken  as  the line number to go to.                               n
 Without an argument, you will be asked for a line number.  In
 either case, the line number must be 1 or greater.

kill-to-end-of-line
 With no argument n, the command deletes all characters to the                                    n
 end of the line.  If it is already at the end of the line, it
 will delete the newline.    With a positive n as an argument,                                                               n
 the command will delete n complete  lines,  newline character                                           n
 and all, starting from the cursor.  With n equal to zero, the                                                            n
 command deletes all text from  the cursor to the beginning of
 the line, but will not delete past the newline character.   A
 negative n is illegal.                            n

list-buffers       With a numeric argument, INVISIBLE buffers are also listed.

move-window-down   With a negative argument, invokes move-window-up.                                                     ______________

select-buffer      Without an argument, the  buffer  is  simply displayed in the
 window.  With an argument,  the buffer is not only displayed,
 but also given the attribute INVISIBLE.

set                If using the set command interactively, preceding the command                                ___
 with  a numeric argument then makes  it  unecessary  for  the
 command  to  ask  for the variable's value (it will still ask
 for the variable's name).  If used in a  command  line,  then
 the command

 set <variable name> <number>

is identical to

 <number> set <variable name>

set-fill-column    With an argument, the fill column  is  set to n.  The default                                                                 n

 the  new upper or lower window  depending  upon  whether  the
 cursor was in the upper or lower half of the old window.

store-macro        Since  macroes  are  numbered,  a  numeric  argument  must be
 provided. These numbered  macroes  are  being  phased  out in
 preference for named macros.

store-procedure    If the command is provided a numeric argument, it will assume
 that store-macro is actually being called.                        ___________

trim-region        Without an argument, trim-region removes spaces and tabs from                                        ___________
 the end of the lines between the mark and the cursor. With an
 argument n,  the  commands  trim  n  lines  - forward if n is                            n                        n                      n

Machine Dependent Notes                            Machine Dependent Notes


This appendix lists some notes specific to individual implementations of
MicroEMACS. Every attempt has been made  to  allow  EMACS to be identical on all
machines, but we  have  also  tried  to  take advantage of function keys, cursor
keys, mice, and special screen modes where possible.

I.1  IBM-PC/XT/AT and its clonesI.1  IBM-PC/XT/AT and its clones


The IBM-PC family of computers is supported with a variety  of different
display adapters. EMACS will  attempt  to discover what adapter is connected and
use  the proper driver for it. Below is a list of the currently supported  video
adapters:

Adapter                         $sres           Original mode used_______                         _____           ________ ____ ____
Monochrome Graphics Adapter     MONO            MONO
Color Graphics Adapter          CGA             CGA

Enhanced Graphics Adapter       EGA             CGA
Video Graphics Adapter          VGA             CGA
VGA12

If a driver for a Microsoft compatable mouse is installed on the system,
EMACS will use the mouse  in text mode and allow the user all the standard mouse
functions. The mouse cursor will  appear  to  be  a  block of color in the color
opposite of it's background.

EMACS also takes advantage of various function keys and the keys  on the
keypad on an IBM-PC. The function keys are initially not bound to any particular
functions (except by the emacs.rc startup file), but the keypad keys  do default
to the following:

Keypad key      Function______ ___      ________
Home            beginning-of-file
CSRS UP         previous-line
Pg Up           previous-page

All these special keys are indicated in EMACS macroes by  use  of the FN                                                                              FN
prefix. Below is a list of many of the keys and the codes used to  specify them.
Also the codes may be gotten by using  the  describe-key  (^X  ?) command on the
suspect key.

I.2  HP 150I.2  HP 150


This machine from Hewlett Packard is very unusual for an  MSDOS machine.
It  has a touch screen and is very function key oriented. An additional command,
label-function-key  allows you to place labels on the  on  screen  function  key__________________
labels. A numeric argument indicates which function key to  label  (one  through
eight) and then the program prompts for a 16 character label, which will be used
as two lines of eight characters. To label function key  three  with "save file"
from a macro, you would use:

3 label-function-key "save              file"

Notice the 4 spaces after "save". This forces  "file"  to  begin  on the
second line of the label.

I.3  Atari 520/1040STI.3  Atari 520/1040ST


The ATARI ST family of computers  have  a dual personality. They may use
either a monochrome or a color screen. EMACS supports two screen  resolutions on
each monitor.

NOTE                                      NOTE

 When you set MicroEMACS up on your system, please remember  to install
 it on the desktop as a GEM application. If you have EMACS set as a TOS
 application,  the mouse will not function  properly,  and  EMACS  will
 alert you to this problem by beeping the bell.

Monitor $sres size #color $palette format_______ _____ ____ ______ ________ ______
Color   LOW     40x25   16      000111222333444555666777
MEDIUM  80x25   4       000111222333
Mono    HIGH    80x25   2       000
DENSE   80x50   2       000

The $palette environment variable can be used to change  what  color  is
associated  with  each  color name. With a color monitor, each  group  of  three
digits  indicates  an  octal number specifying the RED, GREEN and BLUE levels of
that color. Each color digit  can  vary  from  0  to 7. For example, the initial
setting of $palette in LOW resolution is:

000700070770007707077777

which broken up is:

000 700 070 770 007 707 077 777

which means:

000     Black
700     Red
070     Green
770     Yellow
007     Blue
707     Magenta
077     Cyan
777     White

Also the mouse buttons are bound to mouse functions as described  in the
chapter about mice. The cursor keys and the function keys are bound similarly to
IBM-PC.

Files generated by EMACS on the ATARI ST have a single  return character
at  the  end  of each line, unlike the desktop files  which  want  to  have  two
returns. This makes  it  display  files  strangely from GEM's [SHOW] option, but


92Machine Dependent Notes                            MicroEMACS Reference Manual


makes the files port  to  other computers much nicer. When compiling MicroEMACS,
the ADDCR symbol in estruct.h will cause emacs to generate line ending sequences                    estruct.h
compatible with GEM.

Currently, when operating under the Mark Williams MSH program, EMACS can
shell out and perform external commands. This capability will be added later for
the Beckmeyer shell and under GEMDOS.

the colors defined for the workbench.

Note about Compiling MicroEMACS

 If you are compiling the sources on the AMIGA  to  produce  an
 executable image, and you  are  using the Lattice compiler, be sure to
 give the CLI command  'STACK  40000' before compiling to make sure the
 compiler  has  sufficient  stack   space   to   successfully  complete
 compilation.

I.5  UNIX V5, V7, and BSD4.[23]I.5  UNIX V5, V7, and BSD4.[23]


MicroEMACS under UNIX utilizes  the  TERMCAP  library to provide machine                                             TERMCAP
independent screen functions. Make sure that termcap is  available  and properly
set on your account before attempting to use MicroEMACS.

Under systems which support job control, you can use  the  ^XD  suspend-                                                                   ^XD  ________
emacs  command  to  place EMACS into the background. This carries a much smaller_____
overhead  than  bringing  up a new shell under EMACS. EMACS will properly redraw
the screen when you bring it back to the foreground.

If the  symbol  VT100  has  been set to 1 in the estruct.h options file,                                                         _________
EMACS will recognize  the key sequence <ESC>[ as the lead in sequence for the FN
function key prefix.

With the addition  of  some very machine/operating system specific code,
EMACS can prevent two or more people from modifying the same  file  at  the same
time. The upper level of a set of functions to provide file locking exist in the
source  file LOCK.C.  It requires two machine  specific  functions  written  and             LOCK.C
linked into EMACS for it to operate properly.

char *dolock(fname)

char *fname;

dolock() locks a file, preventing others from modifying it. If
it succeeds, it returns NULL, otherwise it returns a pointer to
a string in the form "LOCK ERROR: explanation".

char *undolock(fname)

char *fname;

undolock() unlocks a file, allowing others to modifying it. If
it succeeds, it returns NULL, otherwise it returns a pointer to
a string in the form "LOCK ERROR: explanation".

I.6  DEC VMS operating systemI.6  DEC VMS operating system


TERMINALSTERMINALS

Depending upon the options set  in ESTRUCT.H, MicroEMACS uses either the
capabilities  of  VMS  SMG,  working  with  any  terminal  that  is  defined  in
SMGTERMS.TXT or TERMTABLE.TXT (see your SMG manual for more information), or the
ANSI escape sequences. Full keyboard support, with function keys and everything,
is provided for VT100 and VT200 series compatible terminals.  Mouse  support  is
provided under the ANSI version only at this time. Mouse support is provided for
the VSII workstation's VT220 terminal  emulator,  and  other  terminal emulators
that use the same escape sequences for mouse  control.  (There  is  some partial
support for the BBN BitGraph mouse sequences in the sources, but this is not yet
complete). Terminals may have up to 100 lines and 160 columns.

The  maximum  terminal  size is 256 columns  and  72  row.  If  you  run
MicroEMACS  on a terminal that is larger than this, MicroEMACS will reduce it to
these limits while you are editing.

Flow controlFlow control
Some terminals will require  the  use of XON/XOFF flow control when used
with MicroEMACS. When XON/XOFF flow control is used, you will not be able to use
functions bound to ^S or ^Q, and should use bind-to-key  to  put these functions
on other keys. MicroEMACS does not change the flow  control  characteristics  of
your terminal line while it is running. If your terminal requires  flow control,
you should:

$ SET TERM/HOSTSYNC/TTSYNC

before  entering  MicroEMACS.  If you are on a VSII emulated workstation
terminal, are using  the  SSU  multi-session  protocol (VT330 and VT340 with SSU
enabled), or  are  certain  that  your  terminal  does not require XON/XOFF flow
control, you should

$ SET TERM /HOSTSYNC/NOTTSYNC

This  will allow you to use ^S and ^Q for MicroEMACS commands. Note that
if  you  are using a VSII with VWS V3.2 or later, you must leave  the  /HOSTSYNC
enabled  in  order  for the cross/session  cut  and  paste  capability  to  work
properly.


KEYBOARDKEYBOARD

The VMS version understands the LK201 functions of  VT200  series, vt300
series, and compatible terminals and terminal emulators, and allows you  to bind
to them as function keys. In addition, the VT100 numeric keypad,  in application
mode,  is  available  as function keys. MicroEMACS will only put the keypad into
application mode for you if the KEYPAD  option  is  set  in  ESTRUCT.H.  In this


96Machine Dependent Notes                            MicroEMACS Reference Manual


situation, MicroEmacs will  detect  your  kepad's  state, and restore it to that
state  upon  exiting.  If MicroEMACS has not been compiled with this option, you
may  still put the keypad into application mode by issuing the command "SET TERM
/APPLICATION" before entering MicroEMACS.

WARNING                                    WARNING

 The VMS version contains code for  interpreting  function keys
 that are sent  as  Ansi  sequences  that begin with the ESC character.
 Because  of  this,  MicroEMACS cannot process an incoming ESC until it
 knows  what  character  follows  it.  This  can  cause  problems  with
 terminating search and replace strings. If you use ESC  as  the  meta-
 prefix character (which is the default) you must  type  one additional
 keystroke  following ESC before emacs will  recognize  that  you  have
 edited the  search command prompt, and are continuing. (The additional
 character is processed normally be MicroEMACS, it is NOT discarded.)

 MicroEMACS must wait long  enough  for  the network delay that
 might be involved between  seeing  the  ESC  and seeing the characters
 that  follow  it.  If  holding  down  one  of  the  arrow keys  causes
 characters to drop  into  your  file,  then  you may want to alter the
 delay yourself. The logical variable MICROEMACS$SHORTWAIT  may  be set



97MicroEMACS Reference Manual                              Machine Dependent Notes


 to vary that delay. The default delay is 400ms (4 tenths of a second).
 The equivalent value in MICROEMACS$SHORTWAIT is 4000000.

Special case for BBN BItGraphSpecial case for BBN BItGraph

If you are using the BBN BitGraph, execute the following commands before
entering MicroEMACS, and you will get mouse support:

$ esc[0,8] = 27
$ microemacs$mouse_enable == esc+":5;6;L"+esc+":0;63;;;;;;;;;9;16;c"
$ microemacs$mouse_disable == esc+":5;1;L"+esc+":0;0c"
$ exit

Do NOT do this for any other terminals.

Search List for EMACS.RCSearch List for EMACS.RC

VMS MicroEMACS will  first  search  logical  name  MICROEMACS$LIB:, then
SYS$LOGIN:,  then the current directory, and finally  "sys$sysdevice:[vmstools]"
when looking for startup files or help files.

Please use MICROEMACS$LIB:, and allow the secondary search of [vmstools]
to  become archaic. If desired, MICROEMACS$LIB may be defined to be a VMS search
list that first searches a user directory, and then a system directory.

Generally, you should create a private directory where you keep all your
.CMD files, and in your LOGIN.COM $DEFINE a logical name to point to this area.

In addition to  whatever  commands  you  have in your EMACS.RC file, one
command  you should certainly include is "set $ssave  FALSE".  The  "safe  save"
mechanism, which writes a buffer to a temporary file, deletes the old version of
a file,  and  then  moves  the  temporary  file  to  its  permanent  name, works
wonderfully  on  most  systems, but makes no sense on VMS, which maintains older
versions of a file.

Using MicroEMACS as a subprocessUsing MicroEMACS as a subprocess
MicroEmacs can now be kept in a subprocess.  You  can  arrange  to start
emacs only once in a job, and to re-attach to  it  each time you want to use it.
This is optional. To use this feature, install MicroEMACS in the following way:

1. MicroEMACS contains two images. ME.EXE is a small program for
starting and stopping the Emacs subprocess. The source for ME.
is in ME.C, and should not be linked into MESHR.EXE. MESHR.EXE
is the actual MicroEMACS image. The name "MESHR" is required for
MAIL/NOTES support, see next section for details.

2. Make sure that the SYS$SHARE search list includes MESHR.EXE. If you
 don't have the privilages to move MESHR.EXE into SYS$SHARE, you
 can $ DEFINE the MESHR logical name to be the full name and location of
 the MESHR.EXE program. For example, you could store all of these
 programs in the MICROEMACS$LIB: search list, and say:


98Machine Dependent Notes                            MicroEMACS Reference Manual


$ DEFINE MESHR microemacs$lib:meshr.exe

3. Put ME.EXE in MICROEMACS$LIB and the following line in your LOGIN.COM:

$ me :== $microemacs$lib:me

4. Put a line in your EMACS.RC that will

bind-to-key suspend-emacs ^C  ; use your usual exit-emacs key

Now,  use  the   "$   ME"  command  to  invoke  microemacs.  Subseqeuent
invocations in the same job will re-use the existing subprocess. You can use the
full capabilty of the microemacs command line in the first and in all subsequent
invocations of ME.

WARNING:

MicroEMACS  will  ALWAYS  read in new copies of any files you specify on
the command line, even if you are already editing it.  If  you  edit  a  file  a
second time  with  the  same  MicroEMACS, you will get a NEW buffer with ANOTHER
copy of the file. The old buffer is  still  there  also.  It  is  easy,  in this
situation,  to  accidently  edit  in  a  WRONG BUFFER, and if you write  out  an
obsolete buffer, you will loose earlier edits!

This  is  considered  a bug and may be  fixed  in  a  later  version  of
MicroEMACS. To avoid this situation, do not specify a file  on  the command line
if MicroEMACS already has that file in a buffer. Use the  "find-file" MicroEMACS
command instead.


Using MICROEMACS with MAIL and NOTES:        Using MICROEMACS with MAIL and NOTES:

With VMS V5 and later versions, the MAIL interface to Microemacs is much
simplified. With VMS  V5, the MESHR.EXE image does NOT have to be installed as a
known  image  to  be  used  as  a callable editor from MAIL. Therefore,  to  use
MicroEMACS  as  your  VMS MAIL editor, simply add the following  lines  to  your
LOGIN.COM:

$ DEFINE MAIL$EDIT CALLABLE_ME
$ MAIL :== MAIL/EDIT

and make sure that the SYS$SHARE search list includes MESHR.EXE.  If you
don't  have  privs  or permission to move MESHR.EXE into SYS$SHARE,  you  can  $
DEFINE the MESHR  logical name to be the full name and location of the MESHR.EXE
program.  For  example,  you  could  store  all  of  these   programs   in   the
MICROEMACS$LIB: search list, and say:

$ DEFINE MESHR microemacs$lib:meshr.exe

Note that this is the  same  location  as  is  required  for  using kept
MicroEMACS.

To abort sending a message, exit MicroEMACS without writing out the mail
message file.

To use MicroEMACS as your VAX NOTES editor, issue the  following command
to VAX NOTES:

NOTES> SET PROFILE/EDIT=(ME,CALL)

Note,  if you are still in the dark ages of VMS V4,  you  will  have  to
either  install  MESHR  as a known image, or following the original "Second way"
instructions given in the  existing  appendix F.6 of the older MicroEMACS manual
(previous to version 3.10).

Second way, as described in older versionsSecond way, as described in older versions

In  the  event  that you cannot  get  your  system  manager  to  INSTALL
MicroEMACS as known image, you can use the following technique:

1. In MICROEMACS$LIB:MEMAIL.COM, put the following command file:

$! Use on VAX/VMS as MAIL$EDIT for using MicroEMACS as mail editor.
$ if "''P1'" .NES. "_NL:" then if "''P1'" .NES. "" then copy 'P1' 'P2'
$ define/user sys$input sys$output
$ me 'P2'
$ exit

This file may have come with your MicroEMACS kit.

2. In your LOGIN.COM, put the following lines:

$       me :== $MICROEMACS$LIB:MESHR.EXE ! Assumes meshr.exe is there
$       define mail$edit microemacs$lib:me_edit.com

3. In NOTES, give the command

Building MicroEMACS for VMSBuilding MicroEMACS for VMS

The configuration options are set in file estruct.h:

- Under the category of "Machine/OS definitions", set VMS to "1" and all
others to "0".

- Under "Compiler definitions", set all selections to "0". Selecting
VMS implies that you are using VAXC.

- Under "Special keyboard definitions", be sure "VT100" is set to "0".
This option is not required for the VMS version, it is for other
systems using ANSI terminal support. VMS in combination with SMG or
ANSI already handles the special characteristics of Ansi keyboards.


 100Machine Dependent Notes                            MicroEMACS Reference Manual


- Under "Terminal Output definitions", set either ANSI or SMG to "1"
and all others to "0". As stated previously, only ANSI supports the
mouse at this time.

- Under "Configuration options", you may select as you wish, with the
following notes:

- COLOR     support does not exist for VMS, even when using
color workstations.
- MOUSE     support should be enabled if you have any VSII
workstations. Only supported under the ANSI driver.
- KEYPAD    support recognises whether your keypad is already
in application mode or not, and puts your keypad
in its correct state on exit.
- XNONOFF   automatically allows you to use control-S or
control-Q in MicroEMACS, by disabling the TTSYNC
characteristic. This option should not be set if
MicroEMACS might be used on DecStations or VT100s.
It also should not be used with slow terminals or
terminal emulators connected to fast terminal lines.
- RMSIO     support should absolutely be used. This option
allows the writing and reading of files in VMS's
variable-length format, as opposed to STREAM-LF,
and cuts down on file writing and reading time by
approximately two thirds.
- OPTMEM    support may be used on VMS versions 5.0 and higher.
It substitutes the C library's memory allocation
calls for the native VAX calls, and gives a speed
improvement.

If  you  have  MMS,  you  can  use  the  supplied  DESCRIP.MMS to  build
MicroEMACS.  Otherwise, the command file MEMAKE.COM  has  been  provided.  These
files assume that you are using SMG as your terminal driver.  If  you  are using
ANSI, then you  must  replace SMG with ANSI in the command and opt files. If you
do not have MMS or are missing MEMAKE.COM, simply compile each module with "CC",
and link with the command:

$ LINK MESHR/OPTION/SHARE

Note  that  the  executable  filename  must  end  in  "SHR" in order for
MicroEMACS  to  be  used  as  a callable editor from MAIL or NOTES.   (Method  1
above.)

If you edit any of the Emacs sources, note that  any  global or external
data  must be declared as "noshare" in order for the VMS callable editor support
to  work properly. This applies to all global data used in the VMS version,  but
not to routines or to "static "data.   The  "noshare"  declaration  is #define'd
away on non-VMS systems. If you fail to do this,  VMS  will  not  allow  you  to
INSTALL MicroEMACS as a sharable library.

 Appendix J                                   Appendix J

 Mode Flags                                   Mode Flags


The two environment variables, $cmode and $gmode, contain  a  number the
corresponds  to the modes set for the current buffer and the editor as a  whole.
These  are encoded as the sum of the following numbers for each of the  possible
modes:

WRAP      1             Word wrap
CMODE     2             C indentation and fence match
SPELL     4             Interactive spell checking (Not Implemented Yet)
EXACT     8             Exact matching for searches
VIEW     16             Read-only buffer
OVER     32             Overwrite mode
MAGIC    64             Regular expressions in search
CRYPT   128             Encryption mode active
ASAVE   256             Auto-save mode

So, if you wished to set  the  current  buffer to have CMODE, EXACT, and
MAGIC on, and  all  the others off, you would add up the values for those three,
CMODE 2  +  EXACT 8  +  MAGIC 64 = 74, and use a statement like:

set $cmode 74

or, use the binary or operator to combine the different modes:

set $cmode &bor &bor 2 8 64

Internal FlagsInternal Flags

Some of the ways  EMACS  controls its internal functions can be modified
by the value in the $gflags environment variable. Each bit in this variable will
be used to control a different function.

GFFLAG          1       If this bit is set to zero, EMACS will not
automatically switch to the buffer of the
first file after executing the startup macros.
GFSDRAW         2       If this bit is set to one, supress redraw events.

Current buffer flagsCurrent buffer flags

The $cbflags environment variable allows the user to modify some  of the
characteristics of the  current  buffer. The various characteristics are encoded
as the sum of the following numbers:



 102Mode Flags                                         MicroEMACS Reference Manual


BFINVS          1       Internal invisible buffer
BFCHG           2       Changed since last write
BFTRUNC         4       buffer was truncated when read
BFNAROW         8       buffer has been narrowed

Only  the invisible and changed flags can be  modified  by  setting  the
$cbflags variable. The truncated file and narrowed flags are read only.
