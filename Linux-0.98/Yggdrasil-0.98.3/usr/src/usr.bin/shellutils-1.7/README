This is a package of small shell programming utilities.  They are mostly
compliant with POSIX.2, where applicable.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

nice, stty, and uname require facilities not available on all systems;
`configure' detects this and does not try to compile them on systems
where those facilities are missing.
nohup requires nice.
su will only be installed if you do `make install' as root.

Although these programs have no `-V' or `--version' option, you can
check which version you have by using `grep' or `strings -' on the
binaries, e.g., `grep shellutils /usr/local/bin/basename'.

Mail suggestions and bug reports for these programs to
