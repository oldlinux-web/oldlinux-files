OVERVIEW

This file gives more-or-less system independent configuration information for
C-Kermit 5A.  The major topics covered include program size (and how to reduce
it), how to include or exclude particular features, notes on modem and network
support, and a list of C-Kermit's compile-time options.

For details about your particular operating system, consult the system-specific
installation instructions file:

  CK?INS.DOC

FULLSCREEN DISPLAY

New to edit 180 is support for an MS-DOS-Kermit-like local-mode full screen
file transfer display, accomplished using the curses library, or something
equivalent (for example, the Screen Manager on VAX/VMS).  To enable this
feature, include the following in your CFLAGS:

  -DCK_CURSES

and then change your build procedure (if necessary) to include the necessary
libraries, usually "curses", perhaps also "termcap" or "termlib".

The curses and termcap libraries add considerable size to the program image
(e.g. about 20K on a SUN-4, 40K on a 386).  On some small systems, such as the
AT&T 6300 PLUS, curses support can push Kermit over the edge... even though it
compiles, loads, and runs correctly, its increased size apparently makes it
swap constantly, slowing it down to a crawl, even when the curses display is
not in use.  Some new makefile entries have been added to take care of this
(e.g. sys3upcshcc), but similar tricks might be necessary in other cases too.

An alternative to curses is also available at compile time, but should be
selected if your version of Kermit is to be run in local mode only in an ANSI
terminal environment, for example on a desktop workstation that has an ANSI
console driver.  To select this option in place of curses, define the symbol
MYCURSES:

  -DMYCURSES

instead of CK_CURSES.  The MYCURSES option uses built-in ANSI (VT100) escape
sequences, and depends upon your terminal or console driver to interpret them
correctly.

To use the fullscreen dispay feature, SET FILE DISPLAY FULLSCREEN.  Beware, it
can slow the transfer down a bit (or a lot).  The faster the connection speed,
the more likely the fullscreen display will become the bottleneck.  To test
whether the fullscreen display is slowing your transfers down on a particular
connection, transfer the same with it and without it, and compare the figures
given in the STATISTICS command.  The default file transfer display is still
the old SERIAL ("dots") display, even if you build in curses support.

A compromise between the two styles (new to edit 183), that can be used on any
video display terminal, can be elected at runtime with the SET FILE DISPLAY
CRT.  It relies only on the ability of the terminal to write over the current
line when it receives a bare carriage return.  The same performance comments
apply to this display option.


CHARACTER-SET SUPPORT

By default, C-Kermit is built with support for translation of character sets
for Western European languages (i.e. languages that originated in in Western
Europe, but are now also spoken in the Western Hemisphere and other parts of
the world), via ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1, for Eastern European languages
(ISO Latin-2), and Cyrillic-alphabet languages (ISO Latin/Cyrillic).  Many
file (local) character sets are supported: ISO 646 7-bit national sets, IBM
code pages, Apple, DEC, DG, NeXT, etc.

Japanese language support is available by defining the following symbol in
your CFLAGS (for example in UNIX, you can "make xxx KFLAGS=-KANJI"):

-DKANJI
   Japanese.
   Transfer character-set: Japanese EUC (= JIS X 0201 + JIS X 0208)
   File character-sets: EUC, JIS-7, DEC Kanji, Shift JIS

To build Kermit with no character-set translation at all, include -DNOCSETS in
the CFLAGS.  To build with no Latin-2, add -DNOLATIN2.  To build with no
Cyrillic, add -DNOCYRIL.  If -DNOCSETS is *not* included, you'll always get
LATIN1.  There is presently no way to include Latin-2, Cyrillic, or Kanji
without also including Latin-1.


PROGRAM SIZE

C-Kermit 5A is a large program, much larger than previous releases because of
all the new features, primarily the script programming language, sliding
window packet protocol, and international character set translation.  On some
systems, the size of the program prevents it from being successfully linked
and loaded.  On some others, it occupies so much memory that it is constantly
swapping or paging.  In such cases, you can reduce C-Kermit's size in various
ways, outlined in this section.  The following options can cut down on the
program's size at compile time by removing features or changing the size of
storage areas.

These are symbols that are defined on the CC (C compiler) command line. "-D"
is the normal CC directive to define a symbol so, for example, "-DNODEBUG"
defines the symbol NODEBUG.  Some C compilers might use different syntax, e.g.
"-d NODEBUG" or "/DEFINE=NODEBUG".  For C compilers that do not take
command-line arguments, you can put the corresponding #define statements in
the file CKCSYM.H, for example:

#define NODEBUG

(The #define statement must be on the left margin.)  Here are C-Kermit's
size-related compile-time options.  The ones that take up the most space are
marked by asterisk (*).  If you are desparate to save space, remove debugging
first, rather than some more useful feature.  Remove built-in help only if
absolutely necessary.  The final resort is to remove the interactive command
parser completely, leaving only a UNIX-style command-line interface
("kermit -s foo").  This cuts the program down to about 25% of its fully
configured size.

* -DNODEBUG:  Add this option to omit all debugging code.
  -DNOTLOG:   Add this option to omit transaction logging.
* -DNOHELP:   Add this option to omit built-in help.
  -DTCPSOCKET:Remove this option to omit TCP/IP support.
  -DSUNX25:   Remove this option to omit SunLink X.25 support.
  -DNOMSEND:  Add this option to remove the MSEND command.
* -DNODIAL:   Add this option to remove the DIAL command and modem support.
* -DMINIDIAL: Add this option to support only CCITT, Hayes, and Unknown modems.
  -DNOXMIT:   Add this option to remove the TRANSMIT command.
  -DNOSCRIPT: Add this option to remove the UUCP-style SCRIPT command.
  -DNOCMDL:   Add this option to remove the command-line option interface.
* -DNOSPL:    Add this option to remove the script programming language.
* -DNOICP:    Add this option to remove the entire interactive command parser.
  -DDCMDBUF:  Add this option to allocate command buffers dynamically.
* -DNOCSETS:  Add this option to remove international character set support.
  -DNOLATIN2  Add this option to remove ISO Latin-2 character-set translation.
  -DNOCYRIL:  Add this option to remove Cyrillic character set translation.
  -DNOLATIN2: Add this option to remove Latin-2 character set translation.
  -DKANJI:    Omit this option to exclude Kanji character set translation.
  -DNOESCSEQ: Add this option to omit ANSI escape sequence recognition.
  -DNOSERVER: Add this option to remove server mode.
  -DNOSETKEY: Add this option to remove the SET KEY command.
  -DNOPUSH:   Add this option to remove escapes to operating system.
  -DNOFRILLS: Add this option to remove "frills".
* -DCK_CURSES: Omit this option to keep the curses library out of Kermit.

  -DSBSIZ=nnnn -DRBSIZ=nnnnn
     Change the overall size of the packet send and receive buffers.

-DNOFRILLS removes various command synonyms; the following top-level commands:
CLEAR, DELETE, DISABLE, ENABLE, the multiline version of GET, GETOK, MAIL,
RENAME, TYPE, WHO; and the following REMOTE commands: KERMIT, LOGIN, LOGOUT,
PRINT, TYPE, WHO.

There are options to control Kermit's packet buffer allocations.  The
following symbols are defined in ckcker.h in such a way that you can override
them by redefining them in CFLAGS:

  -DMAXSP=xxxx - Maximum send-packet length, default 2048.
  -DMAXRP=xxxx - Maximum receive-packet length, 2048 for UNIX, 1920 for VMS.
  -DSBSIZ=xxxx - Total allocation for send-packet buffers, default 3008.
  -DRBSIZ=xxxx - Total allocation for receive-packet buffers, default 3008.

The program size is affected by SBSIZ and RBSIZ (send and receive packet
buffer size).  These are static character arrays compiled into the program.
If you wish, you can have Kermit allocate packet buffers dynamically at
runtime using malloc() by including the CFLAGS switch:

  -DDYNAMIC

In this case, the default packet and buffers sizes are changed to:

  -DMAXSP=9024 (for UNIX, 2048 for VMS)
  -DMAXRP=9024 (for UNIX, 1920 for VMS)
  -DSBSIZ=9050
  -DRBSIZ=9050

but you can change the packet buffer sizes (not the maximum packet size) at
runtime using the command:

  SET BUFFERS <sbsiz> <rbsiz>

Using dynamic allocation (-DDYNAMIC) reduces storage requirements for the
executable program on disk, and allows more and bigger packets at runtime.
But dynamic allocation might not work on all systems.  Try it.  If it works
for you, there is no reason not to use it.  But if the program hangs or core
dumps, then omit the -DDYNAMIC option from CFLAGS.

The CK_CURSES option, at least on UNIX, requires C-Kermit be linked with
a large external library.  On certain small systems, C-Kermit programs built
this way have been observed to cause swapping and/or performance problems.

OTHER SIZE-RELATED ITEMS

To make Kermit compile and load successfully, you might have to change your
build procedure to:

   a. Request a larger ("large" or "huge") model.  This is particularly true
      for 16-bit PC-based UNIX versions.  This is typically done with a -M
      and/or -F switch (see your cc manual or man page for details).

   b. Some systems support overlays.  If the program is too big to be built
      as is, check your loader manual ("man ld") to see if an overlay feature
      is available.  See the 2.10/2.11 BSD example in the UNIX makefile. 

   c. Similarly, some systems support "code mapping", which is similar to
      overlays.  Again, see "man ld".

It is also possible to reduce the size of the executable program file in
several other ways:

   a. Include the -O (optimize) compiler switch if it isn't already included
      in your "make" entry (and if it works!).  If your compiler supports
      higher levels of optimization (e.g. -O2), try it.

   b. If your UNIX system supports shared libraries, change the make entry to
      take advantage of this feature.  The way to do this depends on your
      particular system.  Some (like SUNOS) do it automatically.  See the NeXT
      entry for an example.

   c. Strip the program image after building ("man strip" for further info),
      or add -s to the LNKFLAGS (UNIX only).  This strips the program of its
      symbol table and relocation information.

   d. Move character strings into a separate file.  See the 2.10 BSD entry
      for an example.

SPACE/TIME TRADEOFFS

There are over 1000 debug() statements in the program.  If you want to save
both space (program size) and time (program execution time), include -DNODEBUG
in the compilation.  If you want to include debugging for tracking down
problems, omit -DNODEBUG from the make entry.  But when you include debugging,
you have two choices for how it's done.  One definition defines debug() to be
a function call; this is cheap in space but expensive in execution.  The other
defines debug as "if (deblog)" and then the function call, to omit the
function call overhead when the debug log is not active.  But this adds a lot
of space to the program.  Both methods work, take your choice.  The first
method is the default.  To select the second method, include -DIFDEBUG in the
compilation (and don't include -DNODEBUG).

DIALER SUPPORT

-DNODIAL removes automatic modem dialing completely, including the entire
ckudia.c module, plus all commands that refer to dialing in the various
ckuus*.c modules.

-DMINIDIAL leaves the DIAL and related commands (SET/SHOW MODEM, SET/SHOW DIAL)
intact, but removes support for all types of modems except CCITT, Hayes,
Unknown, and None (= Direct).  The MINIDIAL option cuts the size of the dial
module approximately in half.  Use this option if you have only Hayes or
CCITT modems and don't want to carry the baggage for the other types.


NETWORK SUPPORT

C-Kermit supports not only RS-232 serial connections, direct and modem, but
also TCP/IP and X.25 network connections.  The OS/2 version supports DECnet
(LAT) connections.

TCP/IP support requires the Berkeley sockets library, and is generally
available on any BSD-based UNIX system.  It is also available on non-BSD-based
UNIX systems that have a sockets library, including HP-UX and Xenix versions
with Excelan TCP/IP, and many others.  The TCP/IP support includes built-in
Telnet negotiation handling.  To select TCP/IP support, include -DTCPSOCKET in
your makefile entry's CFLAGS, or the appropriate variant (e.g. -DWOLLONGONG,
-DMULTINET, -DEXCELAN, -DWINTCP, etc).  The network support for TCP/IP and
X.25 is in the source files CKCNET.H and CKCNET.C, with miscellaneous SHOW
commands, etc, in the various CKUUS*.C modules, plus code in the CK*CON.C
(CONNECT command) and several other modules to detect TELNET negotiations,
etc.

If you get a compilation error in CKCNET.C, with a complaint like
"incompatible types in assignment", it probably has something to do with the
data type your system uses for the inet_addr() function, which is declared
(usually) in <arpa/inet.h>.  Kermit uses "unsigned long" unless the symbol
INADDRX is defined, in which case "struct inaddr" is used instead.  Try adding
-DINADDRX to CFLAGS in your make entry.

X.25 support requires (a) a SUN, (b) the SunLink product (libraries and header
files), and (c) an X.25 connection into your SUN.  Special makefile entries
sunos4x25 and sunos41x25 (for SUNOS 4.0 and 4.1, respectively) are provided to
build in this feature, but they only work if conditions (a)-(c) are met.  To
request this feature, include -DSUNX25 in CFLAGS.


SECURITY FEATURES

Compiling with the NOPUSH symbol defined removes all the "shell escape"
features from the program, including the PUSH, RUN, and SPAWN commands, the
"!" and "@" command prefixes, OPEN !READ, OPEN !WRITE, job control (including
the SUSPEND command), shell/DCL escape from CONNECT mode, as well as the
server's execution of REMOTE HOST commands (and, of course, the ENABLE HOST
command).  For UNIX, also be sure to read CKUINS.DOC about set[ug]id
installation.


APPENDIX I: SUMMARY OF COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS

These are the symbols that can be specified on the cc command line, listed
alphabetically.  Others are used internally, including those taken from header
files, those defined by the compiler itself, and those inferred from the ones
given below.  Kermit's SHOW VERSIONS command attempts to display most of
these.  See ckcdeb.h and ckcnet.h for inference rules.  For example SVR3
implies ATTSV, MULTINET implies TCPSOCKET, and so on.

The following options are not included in all makefile entries, but they are
beneficial if they work.  It is recommended that you add them to your makefile
entry if they are lacking and test the result.  If it's OK, let me know and
I'll add them to the official makefile:

DYNAMIC        Dynamic packet buffer allocation, bigger packets allowed, etc.
NOSETBUF       Don't do unbuffered single-character writes to the console.
               This tends to speed up CONNECT mode.
