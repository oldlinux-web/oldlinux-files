RZSZ.ZOO is designed to be uploaded to a Unix or Xenix system by
ZCOMM, Professional-YAM or Powercom using the supplied zupl.t script.
Connect to your Unix/Xenix system, select an empty directory, and then
give the YAM/ZCOMM/PowerCom command: "source zupl.t".  This will
upload minirb.c, compile it, and then use minirb to upload the rz/sz
files.  At this time you should study rz.c, sz.c, and rbsb.c to
determine which compile time flags are necessary for your system.

Compile instructions are located in the comments at the beginning of
the rz.c ans sz.c files.  The main compiler flags are -DV7 for V7 and
BSD systems and -DSVR2 for sVr2.  Other #ifdefs in the files may be
activated to deal with various types of kernel brain damage if you
have a mutant system.

Naturally, rz ans sz work best with comm programs that seamlessly
support ZMODEM command and file AutoDownload (PowerCOm, Pro-YAM and
ZCOMM).  Ths DOS "DSZ" sub-program allows ZMODEM file transfers with
older programs, but it must be called manually.  DSZ provides a "mini
term function" that supports ZMODEM AutoDownload.  DSZ (DSZ.ZOO) and
the ZMODEM protocol description (YZMODEM.ZOO) are on TeleGodzilla and
other bulletin boards.  They may be obtained via UUCP from site
"omen", for which a direct UUCP login and telephone number are
provided below.  You may uucp ~uucp/FILES first to determine the
pathnames for the "goodies".
