This is mgm, a macro package for groff.

It is supposed to be compatible with the DWB mm macros,
and has several extensions.

Send bug reports to jh@efd.lth.se with a description of the problem
and a sample of text which reproduces the error.

Don't forget to mention the version of mgm (look in the beginning
of tmac.m) and the version of groff.

Any new ideas or improvements are welcome.

Newest version is available with anonymous FTP
at ftp.efd.lth.se [130.235.48.4], as pub/groff/mm<something>.Z

This README should be bigger :-)

Jörgen.
