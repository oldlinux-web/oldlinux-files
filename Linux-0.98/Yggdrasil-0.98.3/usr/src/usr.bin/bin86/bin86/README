This is the as86 and ld86 distribution written by Bruce Evans.  It's
copyright Bruce Evans, all rights reserved although you may use and copy
it for your personal use.  It's a complete 8086 assembler and loader
which can make 32-bit code for the 386+ processors (under linux it's
used only to create the 16-bit bootsector and setup binaries).  The
syntax is not compatible with the GNU assembler, but closer to intel
syntax ("wrong" order of operands etc). 

Hints for compiling:

 - you'll need the a.out.h-files from the a.out.h directory for the
linker.  These aren't really part of the distribution, but I included
them for ease of setup (in case you need to crosscompile etc).  Do a 
	cp a.out.h/* ld/
or similar before compiling the linker. 

 - the assembler needs the typeconv.o file produced by the linker
compilation.  So compile the linker first, and then do a
	cp ld/typeconv.o as/
before making the assembler. 

This distribution also contains some test-files etc that aren't actually
needed, but as they also give some idea of the assembler syntax, I left
them in.  The directories are as follows:

  as - the assembler sources (minus typeconv.c)
  ld - linker sources
  bcc - bruce evans' cc frontend sources (the actual compiler isn't
	included).
  bccfp - assembly floating point routines written by bruce evans.  Note
	that these use integer register returns, and won't work with the
	linux libraries.  They can be used as examples of as86 code. 
  a.out.h - header files for crosscompilation.

Note that I am NOT the author of this package, but I'll forward any
comments to bruce evans and I'll try to answer any questions about the
assembler/linker I can.  I just made it available as bde doesn't have
ftp capability right now.  Bruce Evans does have mail as
<bde@runx.oz.au>.
