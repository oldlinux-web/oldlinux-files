1. Should cause error when an address which requires > 16 bits is referenced
   using 16 bits.

TODO:
	integrate byteord.h with compiler as well as assembler

TODO:
	integrate align.h with compiler and assembler
	use alignment for *86 like compiler - use more portable macro
	((x) + (-(int) (x) & MASK)) when it is either necessary or
	faster

TODO:
	do malloc stuff better, as in compiler

2. Error message about "foo.a is not an object file" is confusing - should
   name archive member.
