Installing GNU CC
******************

   Here is the procedure for installing GNU CC on a Unix system.

  1. If you have built GNU CC previously in the same directory for a
     different target machine, do `make distclean' to delete all files
     that might be invalid.

  2. On a System V release 4 system, make sure `/usr/bin' precedes
     `/usr/ucb' in `PATH'.  The `cc' command in `/usr/ucb' uses
     libraries which have bugs.

  3. Specify the host and target machine configurations.  You do this by
     running the file `configure' with appropriate arguments.

     If you are building a compiler to produce code for the machine it
     runs on, specify just one machine type.  Use the `--target'
     option; the host type will default to be the same as the target. 
     (For information on building a cross-compiler, see *Note
     Cross-Compiler::.)  The command looks like this:

          configure --target=sparc-sun-sunos4.1

     A configuration name may be canonical or it may be more or less
     abbreviated.

     A canonical configuration name has three parts, separated by
     dashes. It looks like this: `CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM'. (The three parts
     may themselves contain dashes; `configure' can figure out which
     dashes serve which purpose.)  For example, `m68k-sun-sunos4.1'
     specifies a Sun 3.

     You can also replace parts of the configuration by nicknames or
     aliases. For example, `sun3' stands for `m68k-sun', so
     `sun3-sunos4.1' is another way to specify a Sun 3.  You can also
     use simply `sun3-sunos', since the version of SunOS is assumed by
     default to be version 4.  `sun3-bsd' also works, since `configure'
     knows that the only BSD variant on a Sun 3 is SunOS.

     You can specify a version number after any of the system types,
     and some of the CPU types.  In most cases, the version is
     irrelevant, and will be ignored.  So you might as well specify the
     version if you know it.

     Here are the possible CPU types:

          a29k, arm, cN, hppa1.0, hppa1.1, i386, i860, i960, m68000,
          m68k, m88k, mips, ns32k, romp, rs6000, sparc, vax, we32k.

     Here are the recognized company names.  As you can see, customary
     abbreviations are used rather than the longer official names.

          alliant, altos, apollo, att, convergent, convex, crds, dec,
          dg, encore, harris, hp, ibm, mips, motorola, ncr, next, ns,
          omron, sequent, sgi, sony, sun, tti, unicom.

     The company name is meaningful only to disambiguate when the rest
     of the information supplied is insufficient.  You can omit it,
     writing just `CPU-SYSTEM', if it is not needed.  For example,
     `vax-ultrix4.2' is equivalent to `vax-dec-ultrix4.2'.

     Here is a list of system types:

          bsd, sysv, mach, minix, genix, ultrix, vms, sco, isc, aix,
          sunos, hpux, unos, luna, dgux, newsos, osfrose, osf, dynix,
          aos, ctix.

     You can omit the system type; then `configure' guesses the
     operating system from the CPU and company.

     You can add a version number to the system type; this may or may
     not make a difference.  For example, you can write `bsd4.3' or
     `bsd4.4' to distinguish versions of BSD.  In practice, the version
     number is most needed for `sysv3' and `sysv4', which are often
     treated differently.

     If you specify an impossible combination such as `i860-dg-vms',
     then you may get an error message from `configure', or it may
     ignore part of the information and do the best it can with the
     rest. `configure' always prints the canonical name for the
     alternative that it used.

     Often a particular model of machine has a name.  Many machine
     names are recognized as aliases for CPU/company combinations. 
     Thus, the machine name `sun3', mentioned above, is an alias for
     `m68k-sun'. Sometimes we accept a company name as a machine name,
     when the name is popularly used for a particular machine.  Here is
     a table of the known machine names:

          3300, 3b1, 3bN, 7300, altos3068, altos, apollo68, att-7300,
          balance, convex-cN, crds, decstation-3100, decstation, delta,
          encore, fx2800, gmicro, hp7NN, hp8NN, hp9k2NN, hp9k3NN,
          hp9k7NN, hp9k8NN, iris4d, iris, isi68, m3230, magnum, merlin,
          miniframe, mmax, news-3600, news800, news, next, pbd, pc532,
          pmax, ps2, risc-news, rtpc, sun2, sun386i, sun386, sun3,
          sun4, symmetry, tower-32, tower.

     Remember that a machine name specifies both the cpu type and the
     company name.

     There are three additional options you can specify independently to
     describe variant hardware and software configurations.  These are
     `--with-gnu-as', `--with-gnu-ld', and `--nfp'.

    `--with-gnu-as'
          On certain systems, you must specify whether you want GNU CC
          to work with the usual compilation tools or with the GNU
          compilation tools (including GAS).  Use the `--with-gnu-as'
          argument when you run `configure', if you want to use the GNU
          tools.  (Specify `--with-gnu-ld' as well, since on these
          systems GAS works only with the GNU linker.)  The systems
          were this makes a difference are `i386-ANYTHING-sysv',
          `i860-ANYTHING-bsd', `m68k-hp-hpux', `m68k-sony-bsd',
          `m68k-altos-sysv', `m68000-hp-hpux', and `m68000-att-sysv'. 
          On any other system, `--with-gnu-as' has no effect.

    `--with-gnu-ld'
          Specify the option `--with-gnu-ld' if you plan to use the GNU
          linker.  This inhibits the installation of `collect2', a
          program which otherwise serves as a front-end for the
          system's linker on most configurations.

    `--nfp'
          On certain systems, you must specify whether the machine has
          a floating point unit.  These systems are `m68k-sun-sunosN'
          and `m68k-isi-bsd'.  On any other system, `--nfp' currently
          has no effect, though perhaps there are other systems where
          it could usefully make a difference.

     If you want to install your own homemade configuration files, you
     can use `local' as the company name to access them.  If you use
     configuration `CPU-local', the entire configuration name is used
     to form the configuration file names.

     Thus, if you specify `m68k-local', then the files used are
     `m68k-local.md', `m68k-local.h', `m68k-local.c',
     `xm-m68k-local.h', `t-m68k-local', and `x-m68k-local'.

     Here is a list of configurations that have special treatment or
     special things you must know:

    `i386-*-sco'
          Compilation with RCC is recommended, but it produces lots of
          spurious warnings.  They do not necessarily indicate that
          anything is wrong.

    `i386-sequent'
          Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.  In addition,
          you probably need to create a file named `string.h'
          containing just one line: `#include <strings.h>'.

    `m68000-att'
          AT&T 3b1, a.k.a. 7300 PC.  Special procedures are needed to
          compile GNU CC with this machine's standard C compiler, due
          to bugs in that compiler.  *Note 3b1 Install::.  You can
          bootstrap it more easily with previous versions of GNU CC if
          you have them.

    `m68000-hp-bsd'
          HP 9000 series 200 running BSD.  Note that the C compiler
          that comes with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact
          `law@cs.utah.edu' to get binaries of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

    `m68k-altos'
          Altos 3068.  You must use the GNU assembler, linker and
          debugger, with COFF-encapsulation.  Also, you must fix a
          kernel bug.  Details in the file `README.ALTOS'.

    `m68k-hp-hpux'
          HP 9000 series 300 or 400 running HP-UX.  HP-UX version 8.0
          has a bug in the assembler that prevents compilation of GNU
          CC.  To fix it, get patch PHCO_0800 from HP.

          In addition, `--gas' does not currently work with this
          configuration.  Changes in HP-UX have broken the library
          conversion tool and the linker.

    `m68k-sun'
          Sun 3.  We do not provide a configuration file to use the Sun
          FPA by default, because programs that establish signal
          handlers for floating point traps inherently cannot work with
          the FPA.

    `m88k-svr3'
          Motorola m88k running the AT&T/Unisoft/Motorla V.3 reference
          port. These systems tend to use the Green Hills C, revision
          1.8.5, as the standard C compiler.  There are apparently bugs
          in this compiler that result in object files differences
          between stage 2 and stage 3.  If this happens, make the stage
          4 compiler and compare it to the stage 3 compiler.  If the
          stage 3 and stage 4 object files are identical, this suggests
          a problem with the standard C compiler.  It is best, however,
          to use an older version of GNU CC for bootstrapping.

    `m88k-dgux'
          Motorola m88k running DG/UX.  To build native or cross
          compilers on DG/UX, you must first change to the 88open BCS
          software development environment.  This is done by issuing
          this command:

               eval `sde-target m88kbcs`

    `mips-mips-bsd'
          MIPS machines running the MIPS operating system in BSD mode. 
          It's possible that some old versions of the system lack the
          functions `memcpy', `memcmp', and `memset'.  If your system
          lacks these, you must remove or undo the definition of
          `TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS' in `mips-bsd.h'.

    `mips-sony-sysv'
          Sony MIPS NEWS.  This works in NEWSOS 5.0.1, but not in 5.0.2
          (which uses ELF instead of COFF).  Support for 5.0.2 will
          probably be provided soon by volunteers.

    `ns32k-encore'
          Encore ns32000 system.  Encore systems are supported only
          under BSD.

    `ns32k-*-genix'
          National Semiconductor ns32000 system.  Genix has bugs in
          `alloca' and `malloc'; you must get the compiled versions of
          these from GNU Emacs.

    `ns32k-sequent'
          Go to the Berkeley universe before compiling.  In addition,
          you probably need to create a file named `string.h'
          containing just one line: `#include <strings.h>'.

    `ns32k-utek'
          UTEK ns32000 system ("merlin").  The C compiler that comes
          with this system cannot compile GNU CC; contact
          `tektronix!reed!mason' to get binaries of GNU CC for
          bootstrapping.

    `romp-*-aos'
    `romp-*-mach'
          The only operating systems supported for the IBM RT PC are
          AOS and MACH.  GNU CC does not support AIX running on the RT.

    `rs6000-*-aix'
          Read the file `README.RS6000' for information on how to get a
          fix for a problem in the IBM assembler that prevents use of
          GNU CC.

    `vax-dec-ultrix'
          Don't try compiling with Vax C (`vcc').  It produces
          incorrect code in some cases (for example, when `alloca' is
          used).

          Meanwhile, compiling `cp-parse.c' with pcc does not work
          because of an internal table size limitation in that
          compiler.  To avoid this problem, compile just the GNU C
          compiler first, and use it to recompile building all the
          languages that you want to run.

    `we32k-att-sysv'
          Don't use `-g' when compiling GNU CC.  The system's linker
          seems to be unable to handle such a large program with
          debugging information.

     Here we spell out what files will be set up by `configure'. 
     Normally you need not be concerned with these files.

        * A symbolic link named `config.h' is made to the top-level
          config file for the machine you plan to run the compiler on
          (*note The Configuration File: (gcc.info)Config.).  This file
          is responsible for defining information about the host
          machine.  It includes `tm.h'.

          The top-level config file is located in the subdirectory
          `config'. Its name is always `xm-SOMETHING.h'; usually
          `xm-MACHINE.h', but there are some exceptions.

          If your system does not support symbolic links, you might
          want to set up `config.h' to contain a `#include' command
          which refers to the appropriate file.

        * A symbolic link named `tconfig.h' is made to the top-level
          config file for your target machine.  This is used for
          compiling certain programs to run on that machine.

        * A symbolic link named `tm.h' is made to the
          machine-description macro file for your target machine.  It
          should be in the subdirectory `config' and its name is often
          `MACHINE.h'.

        * A symbolic link named `md' will be made to the machine
          description pattern file.  It should be in the `config'
          subdirectory and its name should be `MACHINE.md'; but MACHINE
          is often not the same as the name used in the `tm.h' file
          because the `md' files are more general.

        * A symbolic link named `aux-output.c' will be made to the
          output subroutine file for your machine.  It should be in the
          `config' subdirectory and its name should be `MACHINE.c'.

        * The command file `configure' also constructs `Makefile' by
          adding some text to the template file `Makefile.in'.  The
          additional text comes from files in the `config' directory,
          named `t-TARGET' and `h-HOST'.  If these files do not exist,
          it means nothing needs to be added for a given target or host.

  4. Make sure the Bison parser generator is installed.  (This is
     unnecessary if the Bison output files `c-parse.c' and `cexp.c' are
     more recent than `c-parse.y' and `cexp.y' and you do not plan to
     change the `.y' files.)

     Bison versions older than Sept 8, 1988 will produce incorrect
     output for `c-parse.c'.

  5. Build the compiler.  Just type `make LANGUAGES=c' in the compiler
     directory.

     `LANGUAGES=c' specifies that only the C compiler should be
     compiled.  The makefile normally builds compilers for all the
     supported languages; currently, C, C++ and Objective C.  However,
     C is the only language that is sure to work when you build with
     other non-GNU C compilers.  In addition, building anything but C
     at this stage is a waste of time.

     In general, you can specify the languages to build by typing the
     argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"', where LIST is one or more words from
     the list `c', `c++', and `objective-c'.

     Ignore any warnings you may see about "statement not reached" in
     `insn-emit.c'; they are normal.  Any other compilation errors may
     represent bugs in the port to your machine or operating system, and
     should be investigated and reported.

     Some commercial compilers fail to compile GNU CC because they have
     bugs or limitations.  For example, the Microsoft compiler is said
     to run out of macro space.  Some Ultrix compilers run out of
     expression space; then you need to break up the statement where
     the problem happens.

     If you are building with a previous GNU C compiler, do not use
     `CC=gcc' on the make command or by editing the Makefile. Instead,
     use a full pathname to specify the compiler, such as
     `CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc'.  This is because make might execute the
     `gcc' in the current directory before all of the compiler
     components have been built.

  6. If you are using COFF-encapsulation, you must convert `libgcc.a' to
     a GNU-format library at this point.  See the file `README.ENCAP'
     in the directory containing the GNU binary file utilities, for
     directions.

  7. If you are building a cross-compiler, stop here.  *Note
     Cross-Compiler::.

  8. Move the first-stage object files and executables into a
     subdirectory with this command:

          make stage1

     The files are moved into a subdirectory named `stage1'. Once
     installation is complete, you may wish to delete these files with
     `rm -r stage1'.

  9. Recompile the compiler with itself, with this command:

          make CC="stage1/gcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O"

     This is called making the stage 2 compiler.

     The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
     languages.  If you don't want them all, you can specify the
     languages to build by typing the argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"'.  LIST
     should contain one or more words from the list `c', `c++',
     `objective-c', and `proto'.  Separate the words with spaces.
     `proto' stands for the programs `protoize' and `unprotoize'; they
     are not a separate language, but you use `LANGUAGES' to enable or
     disable their installation.

     If you are going to build the stage 3 compiler, then you might
     want to build only the C language in stage 2.

     Once you have built the stage 2 compiler, if you are short of disk
     space, you can delete the subdirectory `stage1'.

     On a 68000 or 68020 system lacking floating point hardware, unless
     you have selected a `tm.h' file that expects by default that there
     is no such hardware, do this instead:

          make CC="stage1/gcc -Bstage1/" CFLAGS="-g -O -msoft-float"

 10. If you wish to test the compiler by compiling it with itself one
     more time, do this:

          make stage2
          make CC="stage2/gcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O"

     This is called making the stage 3 compiler.  Aside from the `-B'
     option, the options should be the same as when you made the stage 2
     compiler.

     The command shown above builds compilers for all the supported
     languages.  If you don't want them all, you can specify the
     languages to build by typing the argument `LANGUAGES="LIST"', as
     described above.

     Then compare the latest object files with the stage 2 object
     files--they ought to be identical, unless they contain time stamps.
     You can compare the files, disregarding the time stamps if any,
     like this:

          make compare

     This will mention any object files that differ between stage 2 and
     stage 3.  Any difference, no matter how innocuous, indicates that
     the stage 2 compiler has compiled GNU CC incorrectly, and is
     therefore a potentially serious bug which you should investigate
     and report.

     If your system does not put time stamps in the object files, then
     this is a faster way to compare them (using the Bourne shell):

          for file in *.o; do
          cmp $file stage2/$file
          done

     If you have built the compiler with the `-mno-mips-tfile' option on
     MIPS machines, you will not be able to compare the files.

 11. Install the compiler driver, the compiler's passes and run-time
     support. You can use the following command:

          make CC="stage2/gcc -Bstage2/" CFLAGS="-g -O" install LANGUAGES="LIST"

     (Use the same value for `CC', `CFLAGS' and `LANGUAGES' that you
     used when compiling the files that are being installed.  One
     reason this is necessary is that some versions of Make have bugs
     and recompile files gratuitously when you do this step.  If you
     use the same variable values, those files will be recompiled
     properly.

     This copies the files `cc1', `cpp' and `libgcc.a' to files `cc1',
     `cpp' and `libgcc.a' in directory
     `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/TARGET/VERSION', which is where the
     compiler driver program looks for them.  Here TARGET is the target
     machine type specified when you ran `configure', and VERSION is
     the version number of GNU CC.  This naming scheme permits various
     versions and/or cross-compilers to coexist.

     It also copies the driver program `gcc' into the directory
     `/usr/local/bin', so that it appears in typical execution search
     paths.

     On some systems, this command will cause recompilation of some
     files. This is usually due to bugs in `make'.  You should either
     ignore this problem, or use GNU Make.

     *Warning: there is a bug in `alloca' in the Sun library.  To avoid
     this bug, be sure to install the executables of GNU CC that were
     compiled by GNU CC.  (That is, the executables from stage 2 or 3,
     not stage 1.)  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never
     the one in the library.*

     (It is usually better to install GNU CC executables from stage 2
     or 3, since they usually run faster than the ones compiled with
     some other compiler.)

 12. Correct errors in the header files on your machine.

     Various system header files often contain constructs which are
     incompatible with ANSI C, and they will not work when you compile
     programs with GNU CC.  This behavior consists of substituting for
     macro argument names when they appear inside of character
     constants.  The most common offender is `ioctl.h'.

     You can overcome this problem when you compile by specifying the
     `-traditional' option.

     Alternatively, on Sun systems and 4.3BSD at least, you can correct
     the include files by running the shell script `fixincludes'.  This
     installs modified, corrected copies of the files `ioctl.h',
     `ttychars.h' and many others, in a special directory where only
     GNU CC will normally look for them.  This script will work on
     various systems because it chooses the files by searching all the
     system headers for the problem cases that we know about.

     Use the following command to do this:

          make install-fixincludes

     If you selected a different directory for GNU CC installation when
     you installed it, by specifying the Make variable `prefix' or
     `libdir', specify it the same way in this command.

     Note that some systems are starting to come with ANSI C system
     header files.  On these systems, don't run `fixincludes'; it may
     not work, and is certainly not necessary.

   If you cannot install the compiler's passes and run-time support in
`/usr/local/lib', you can alternatively use the `-B' option to specify
a prefix by which they may be found.  The compiler concatenates the
prefix with the names  `cpp', `cc1' and `libgcc.a'. Thus, you can put
the files in a directory `/usr/foo/gcc' and specify `-B/usr/foo/gcc/'
when you run GNU CC.

   Also, you can specify an alternative default directory for these
files by setting the Make variable `libdir' when you make GNU CC.


Compilation in a Separate Directory
====================================

   If you wish to build the object files and executables in a directory
other than the one containing the source files, here is what you must
do differently:

  1. Make sure you have a version of Make that supports the `VPATH'
     feature.  (GNU Make supports it, as do Make versions on most BSD
     systems.)

  2. If you have ever run `configure' in the source directory, you must
     undo the configuration.  Do this by running:

          make distclean

  3. Go to the directory in which you want to build the compiler before
     running `configure':

          mkdir gcc-sun3
          cd gcc-sun3

     On systems that do not support symbolic links, this directory must
     be on the same file system as the source code directory.

  4. Specify where to find `configure' when you run it:

          ../gcc/configure ...

     This also tells `configure' where to find the compiler sources;
     `configure' takes the directory from the file name that was used to
     invoke it.  But if you want to be sure, you can specify the source
     directory with the `--srcdir' option, like this:

          ../gcc/configure --srcdir=../gcc sun3

     The directory you specify with `--srcdir' need not be the same as
     the one that `configure' is found in.

   Now, you can run `make' in that directory.  You need not repeat the
configuration steps shown above, when ordinary source files change.  You
must, however, run `configure' again when the configuration files
change, if your system does not support symbolic links.


Building and Installing a Cross-Compiler
=========================================

   GNU CC can function as a cross-compiler for many machines, but not
all.

   * Cross-compilers for the Mips as target do not work because the
     auxiliary programs `mips-tdump.c' and `mips-tfile.c' can't be
     compiled on anything but a Mips.

   * Cross-compilers to or from the Vax probably don't work completely
     because the Vax uses an incompatible floating point format (not
     IEEE format).

   Since GNU CC generates assembler code, you probably need a
cross-assembler that GNU CC can run, in order to produce object files.
If you want to link on other than the target machine, you need a
cross-linker as well.  You also need header files and libraries suitable
for the target machine that you can install on the host machine.

   To build GNU CC as a cross-compiler, you start out by running
`configure'.  You must specify two different configureations, the host
and the target.  Use the `--host=HOST' option for the host and
`--target=TARGET' to specify the target type.  For example, here is how
to configure for a cross-compiler that runs on a hypothetical Intel 386
system and produces code for an HP 68030 system running BSD:

     configure --target=m68k-hp-bsd4.3 --host=i386-bozotheclone-bsd4.3

   Next you should install the cross-assembler and cross-linker (and
`ar' and `ranlib').  Put them in the directory `/usr/local/TARGET'. 
The installation of GNU CC will find them there and copy or link them
to the proper place to find them when you run the cross-compiler later.

   If you want to install any additional libraries to use with the
cross-compiler, put them in the directory `/usr/local/TARGET/lib'; all
files in that subdirectory will be installed in the proper place when
you install the cross-compiler. Likewise, put the header files for the
target machine in `/usr/local/TARGET/include'.

   Then you can proceed just as for compiling a single-machine compiler
through the step of building stage 1.

   When you are using a cross-compiler configuration, building stage 1
does not compile all of GNU CC.  This is because one part of building,
the compilation of `libgcc2.c', requires use of the cross-compiler.

   However, when you type `make install' to install the bulk of the
cross-compiler, that will also compile `libgcc2.c' and install the
resulting `libgcc.a'.

   You will find it necessary to produce a substitute for `libgcc1.a'.
Normally this file is compiled with the "native compiler" for the
target machine; compiling it with GNU CC does not work.  But compiling
it with the host machine's compiler also doesn't work--that produces a
file that would run on the host, and you need it to run on the target.

   We can't give you any automatic way to produce this substitute.  For
some targets, the subroutines in `libgcc1.c' are not actually used. You
need not provide the ones that won't be used.  The ones that most
commonly are used are the multiplication, division and remainder
routines--many RISC machines rely on the library for this.  One way to
make them work is to define the appropriate `perform_...' macros for
the subroutines that you need.  If these definitions do not use the C
arithmetic operators that they are meant to implement, you might be
able to compile them with the cross-compiler you have just built.

   Do not try to build stage 2 for a cross-compiler.  It doesn't work to
rebuild GNU CC as a cross-compiler using the cross-compiler, because
that would produce a program that runs on the target machine, not on the
host.  For example, if you compile a 386-to-68030 cross-compiler with
itself, the result will not be right either for the 386 (because it was
compiled into 68030 code) or for the 68030 (because it was configured
for a 386 as the host).  If you want to compile GNU CC into 68030 code,
whether you compile it on a 68030 or with a cross-compiler on a 386, you
must specify a 68030 as the host when you configure it.


Installing GNU CC on the HP Precision Architecture
===================================================

   There are two variants of this CPU, called 1.0 and 1.1, which have
different machine descriptions.  You must use the right one for your
machine.  All 7NN machines and 8N7 machines use 1.1, while all other
8NN machines use 1.0.

   The easiest way to handle this problem is to use `configure hpNNN'
or `configure hpNNN-hpux', where NNN is the model number of the
machine.  Then `configure' will figure out if the machine is a 1.0 or
1.1.  Use `uname -a' to find out the model number of your machine.

   `-g' does not work on HP-UX, since that system uses a peculiar
debugging format which GNU CC does not know about.  There is a
preliminary version available of some modified GNU tools including the
GDB debugger which do work with GNU CC for debugging.  You can get them
by anonymous ftp from `mancos.cs.utah.edu' in the `dist' subdirectory. 
You would need to install GAS in the file

     /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/CONFIGURATION/GCCVERSION/as

where CONFIGURATION is the configuration name (perhaps `hpNNN-hpux')
and GCCVERSION is the GNU CC version number.

   If you do this, delete the line

     #undef DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO

from `tm.h' before you build GNU CC, to enable generation of debugging
information.


Installing GNU CC on the Sun
=============================

   Make sure the environment variable `FLOAT_OPTION' is not set when
you compile `libgcc.a'.  If this option were set to `f68881' when
`libgcc.a' is compiled, the resulting code would demand to be linked
with a special startup file and would not link properly without special
pains.

   There is a bug in `alloca' in certain versions of the Sun library.
To avoid this bug, install the binaries of GNU CC that were compiled by
GNU CC.  They use `alloca' as a built-in function and never the one in
the library.

   Some versions of the Sun compiler crash when compiling GNU CC.  The
problem is a segmentation fault in cpp.  This problem seems to be due to
the bulk of data in the environment variables.  You may be able to avoid
it by using the following command to compile GNU CC with Sun CC:

     make CC="TERMCAP=x OBJS=x LIBFUNCS=x STAGESTUFF=x cc"


Installing GNU CC on the 3b1
=============================

   Installing GNU CC on the 3b1 is difficult if you do not already have
GNU CC running, due to bugs in the installed C compiler.  However, the
following procedure might work.  We are unable to test it.

  1. Comment out the `#include "config.h"' line on line 37 of `cccp.c'
     and do `make cpp'.  This makes a preliminary version of GNU cpp.

  2. Save the old `/lib/cpp' and copy the preliminary GNU cpp to that
     file name.

  3. Undo your change in `cccp.c', or reinstall the original version,
     and do `make cpp' again.

  4. Copy this final version of GNU cpp into `/lib/cpp'.

  5. Replace every occurrence of `obstack_free' in the file `tree.c'
     with `_obstack_free'.

  6. Run `make' to get the first-stage GNU CC.

  7. Reinstall the original version of `/lib/cpp'.

  8. Now you can compile GNU CC with itself and install it in the normal
     fashion.


Installing GNU CC on Unos
==========================

   Use `configure unos' for building on Unos.

   The Unos assembler is named `casm' instead of `as'.  For some
strange reason linking `/bin/as' to `/bin/casm' changes the behavior,
and does not work.  So, when installing GNU CC, you should install the
following script as `as' in the subdirectory where the passes of GCC
are installed:

     #!/bin/sh
     casm $*

   The default Unos library is named `libunos.a' instead of `libc.a'. 
To allow GNU CC to function, either change all references to `-lc' in
`gcc.c' to `-lunos' or link `/lib/libc.a' to `/lib/libunos.a'.

   When compiling GNU CC with the standard compiler, to overcome bugs in
the support of `alloca', do not use `-O' when making stage 2. Then use
the stage 2 compiler with `-O' to make the stage 3 compiler.  This
compiler will have the same characteristics as the usual stage 2
compiler on other systems.  Use it to make a stage 4 compiler and
compare that with stage 3 to verify proper compilation.

   (Perhaps simply defining `ALLOCA' in `x-crds' as described in the
comments there will make the above paragraph superfluous.  Please
inform us of whether this works.)

   Unos uses memory segmentation instead of demand paging, so you will
need a lot of memory.  5 Mb is barely enough if no other tasks are
running. If linking `cc1' fails, try putting the object files into a
library and linking from that library.


Installing GNU CC on VMS
=========================

   The VMS version of GNU CC is distributed in a backup saveset
containing both source code and precompiled binaries.

   To install the `gcc' command so you can use the compiler easily, in
the same manner as you use the VMS C compiler, you must install the VMS
CLD file for GNU CC as follows:

  1. Define the VMS logical names `GNU_CC' and `GNU_CC_INCLUDE' to
     point to the directories where the GNU CC executables (`gcc-cpp',
     `gcc-cc1', etc.) and the C include files are kept.  This should be
     done with the commands:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.] gnu_cc
          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.include.] gnu_cc_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory names.  These commands can
     be placed in your system startup file so they will be executed
     whenever the machine is rebooted.  You may, if you choose, do this
     via the `GCC_INSTALL.COM' script in the `[GCC]' directory.

  2. Install the `GCC' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables gnu_cc:[000000]gcc
          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables

  3. To install the help file, do the following:

          $ lib/help sys$library:helplib.hlb gcc.hlp

     Now you can invoke the compiler with a command like `gcc /verbose
     file.c', which is equivalent to the command `gcc -v -c file.c' in
     Unix.

   If you wish to use GNU C++ you must first install GNU CC, and then
perform the following steps:

  1. Define the VMS logical name `GNU_GXX_INCLUDE' to point to the
     directory where the preprocessor will search for the C++ header
     files. This can be done with the command:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[gcc.gxx_include.] gnu_gxx_include

     with the appropriate disk and directory name.  If you are going to
     be using libg++, this is where the libg++ install procedure will
     install the libg++ header files.

  2. Obtain the file `gcc-cc1plus.exe', and place this in the same
     directory that `gcc-cc1.exe' is kept.

     The GNU C++ compiler can be invoked with a command like `gcc /plus
     /verbose file.cc', which is equivalent to the command `g++ -v -c
     file.cc' in Unix.

   We try to put corresponding binaries and sources on the VMS
distribution tape.  But sometimes the binaries will be from an older
version that the sources, because we don't always have time to update
them.  (Use the `/version' option to determine the version number of
the binaries and compare it with the source file `version.c' to tell
whether this is so.)  In this case, you should use the binaries you get
to recompile the sources.  If you must recompile, here is how:

  1. Copy the file `vms.h' to `tm.h', `xm-vms.h' to `config.h',
     `vax.md' to `md.' and `vax.c' to `aux-output.c'.  The files to be
     copied are found in the subdirectory named `config'; they should
     be copied to the main directory of GNU CC.  If you wish, you may
     use the command file `config-gcc.com' to perform these steps for
     you.

  2. Setup the logical names and command tables as defined above.  In
     addition, define the VMS logical name `GNU_BISON' to point at the
     to the directories where the Bison executable is kept.  This
     should be done with the command:

          $ assign /system /translation=concealed -
            disk:[bison.] gnu_bison

     You may, if you choose, use the `INSTALL_BISON.COM' script in the
     `[BISON]' directory.

  3. Install the `BISON' command with the command line:

          $ set command /table=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            /output=sys$common:[syslib]dcltables -
            gnu_bison:[000000]bison
          $ install replace sys$common:[syslib]dcltables

  4. Type `@make-gcc' to recompile everything (alternatively, you may
     submit the file `make-gcc.com' to a batch queue).  If you wish to
     build the GNU C++ compiler as well as the GNU CC compiler, you must
     first edit `make-gcc.com' and follow the instructions that appear
     in the comments.

  5. In order to use GCC, you need a library of functions which GCC
     compiled code will call to perform certain tasks, and these
     functions are defined in the file `libgcc2.c'.  To compile this
     you should use the command procedure `make-l2.com', which will
     generate the library `libgcc2.olb'. `libgcc2.olb' should be built
     using the compiler built from the same distribution that
     `libgcc2.c' came from, and `make-gcc.com' will automatically do
     all of this for you.

     To install the library, use the following commands:

          $ lib gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib/delete=(new,eprintf)
          $ lib libgcc2/extract=*/output=libgcc2.obj
          $ lib gnu_cc:[000000]gcclib libgcc2.obj

     The first command simply removes old modules that will be replaced
     with modules from libgcc2.  If the VMS librarian complains about
     those modules not being present, simply ignore the message and
     continue on with the next command.

     Whenever you update the compiler on your system, you should also
     update the library with the above procedure.

     You may wish to build GCC in such a way that no files are written
     to the directory where the source files reside.  An example would
     be the when the source files are on a read-only disk.  In these
     cases, execute the following DCL commands (substituting your
     actual path names):

          $ assign dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]tran=conc, -
                   dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]/tran=conc gcc_build
          $ set default gcc_build:[000000]

     where `dua1:[gcc.source_dir.]' contains the source code, and
     `dua0:[gcc.build_dir.]' is meant to contain all of the generated
     object files and executables.  Once you have done this, you can
     proceed building GCC as described above.  (Keep in mind that
     `gcc_build' is a rooted logical name, and thus the device names in
     each element of the search list must be an actual physical device
     name rather than another rooted logical name).

     *If you are building GNU CC with a previous version of GNU CC, you
     also should check to see that you have the newest version of the
     assembler*.  In particular, GNU CC version 2 treats global constant
     variables slightly differently from GNU CC version 1, and GAS
     version 1.38.1 does not have the patches required to work with GCC
     version 2. If you use GAS 1.38.1, then `extern const' variables
     will not have the read-only bit set, and the linker will generate
     warning messages about mismatched psect attributes for these
     variables.  These warning messages are merely a nuisance, and can
     safely be ignored.

     If you are compiling with a version of GNU CC older than 1.33,
     specify `/DEFINE=("inline=")' as an option in all the
     compilations.  This requires editing all the `gcc' commands in
     `make-cc1.com'. (The older versions had problems supporting
     `inline'.)  Once you have a working 1.33 or newer GNU CC, you can
     change this file back.

   Under previous versions of GNU CC, the generated code would
occasionally give strange results when linked to the sharable `VAXCRTL'
library. Now this should work.

   Even with this version, however, GNU CC itself should not be linked
to the sharable `VAXCRTL'.  The `qsort' routine supplied with `VAXCRTL'
has a bug which can cause a compiler crash.

   Similarly, the preprocessor should not be linked to the sharable
`VAXCRTL'.  The `strncat' routine supplied with `VAXCRTL' has a bug
which can cause the preprocessor to go into an infinite loop.

   If you attempt to link to the sharable `VAXCRTL', the VMS linker
will strongly resist any effort to force it to use the `qsort' and
`strncat' routines from `gcclib'.  Until the bugs in `VAXCRTL' have
been fixed, linking any of the compiler components to the sharable
VAXCRTL is not recommended.  (These routines can be bypassed by placing
duplicate copies of `qsort' and `strncat' in `gcclib' under different
names, and patching the compiler sources to use these routines).  Both
of the bugs in `VAXCRTL' are still present in VMS version 5.4-1, which
is the most recent version as of this writing.

   The executables that are generated by `make-cc1.com' and
`make-cccp.com' use the nonshared version of `VAXCRTL' (and thus use
the `qsort' and `strncat' routines from `gcclib.olb').
