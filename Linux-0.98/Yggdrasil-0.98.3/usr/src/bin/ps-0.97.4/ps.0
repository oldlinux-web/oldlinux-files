    PPss  shows  information  about running processes.  tty name or
    pid must be given after the last  option,  no  space  between
    options and pid or tty, -- is optional.

    Description of the displayed fields:

    PRI priority,  this is not the priority in task_struct, a low
        number means that the process gets more cpu  time  if  it
        can run.

    NI  nice value, a positive value means less cpu time.

    SIZE
        virtual image size, size of text+data+stack

    RSS resident set size, kilobytes of program in memory.

    WCHAN
        name  of  the kernel function where the process is sleep-
        ing.

    STAT
        status

        R   runnable

        S   sleeping

        D   uninterruptible sleep

        T   stopped or traced

        Z   zombie

        W   process has no resident pages

    %CPU
        percentage of cpu time / real  time,  this  is  different
        from UNIX ps

    %MEM
        percentage  of  available  memory in use by this process,
        the total of all processes can  exceed  100%  because  of
        shared  pages.  This is not a decaying average as in UNIX
        ps.

    TT  controlling tty

    TPGID
        current process group of controlling tty

    PAGEIN
        number of major page faults

    TRS text resident size, does not include shared libraries

    DRS data resident size,  includes  dirty  library  pages  and
        stack.

    SWAP
        kilobytes (with --pp pages) on swap device

    SHRD
        shared memory

    DT  dirty library pages (kb or # pages with -p)

    F   process flags

        04  process has used math emulator

        10  process is being traced

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
    --aa  show processes of all users

    --cc  show command name stored in task_struct

    --ee  show environment, cannot be combined with --ee option

    --hh  no header

    --jj  jobs format: pgid sid

    --ll  long format: flags, wchan, nice value, priority

    --mm  displays  memory info (combine with --pp flag to get number
        of pages): shared and swapped sizes, minor and major page
        faults.   The  size  field  shown with this option is the
        size computed from the page tables, it should be equal to
        the sum of SWAP and RSS.

    --XX  another format: displays the registers eip and esp, time-
        out and alarm

    --nn  numeric output for USER and WCHAN

    --rr  running processes only, these  include  processes  in  an
        uninterruptible sleep

    --ss  signal format

    --uu  user format: gives user name and start-time

    --vv  vm format

    --ww  wide output, can be specified more then once

    --xx  show processes without controlling terminal

    --SS  add cpu time and page fault count from reaped children

    --UU  update  psdatabase. The arguments syspath and swappath if
        given are stored in the psdatabase and the symbol info is
        updated,  if  no system path is given the path in the old
        psdatabase is used.

    --tt_x_x
        only procs with controlling tty _x_x, use for _x_x  the  same
        letters  as  shown in TT field. If _x_x is omitted the con-
        trolling terminal of ps is used.

FFIILLEESS
    /dev/kmem kernel memory
    /dev/swap swapdevice or (link to) swap file
    /etc/psdatabase symbol information

SSEEEE AALLSSOO
    kill(1)

BBUUGGSS
    Tty names are hard coded: virtual consoles are  a1,  a2,  ...
    serial lines are s0 and s1, pty's are p0, p1 ...

    %CPU and %MEM don't give decaying averages, %CPU is different
    from UNIX ps.

    Things can change while ppss is running, the picture  it  gives
    is only a close approximation to reality.
