              Do not print error messages about files whose  own-
              ership cannot be changed.

       _-_v_, _-_-_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
              Verbosely describe ownership changes.

       _-_R_, _-_-_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
              Recursively  change  ownership  of  directories and
              their contents.

       The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as  well
       as  `--', for compatibility with previous releases.  Even-
       tually support for `+' will  be  removed,  because  it  is
       incompatible with the POSIX.2 standard.
