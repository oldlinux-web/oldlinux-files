     This manual page documents the GNU version of llss.  ddiirr and vvddiirr are
     versions of llss with different default output formats.   These  pro-
     grams  list  each given file or directory path.  Directory contents
     are sorted alphabetically.  For llss, files are by default listed  in
     columns,  sorted  vertically, if the standard output is a terminal;
     otherwise they are listed one per line.  For ddiirr, files are by  de-
     fault listed in columns, sorted vertically.  For vvddiirr, files are by
     default listed in long format.

     _-_a_, _-_-_a_l_l
	  List all files in directories, including all files that  start
	  with `.'.

     _-_b_, _-_-_e_s_c_a_p_e
	  Quote nongraphic characters in file names using alphabetic and
	  octal backslash sequences like those used in C.

     _-_c_, _-_-_t_i_m_e_=_c_t_i_m_e_, _-_-_t_i_m_e_=_s_t_a_t_u_s
	  Sort directory contents according to the files' status  change
	  time  instead  of  the modification time.  If the long listing
	  format is being used, print the status change time instead  of
	  the modification time.

     _-_d_, _-_-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
	  List  directories  like other files, rather than listing their
	  contents.

     _-_g   Ignored; for Unix compatibility.

     _-_i_, _-_-_i_n_o_d_e
	  Print the index number of each file to the left  of  the  file
	  name.

     _-_k_, _-_-_k_i_l_o_b_y_t_e_s
	  If file sizes are being listed, print them in kilobytes.  This
	  overrides the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT.

     _-_l_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_l_o_n_g_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_v_e_r_b_o_s_e
	  In addition to the name of each file,  print  the  file  type,
	  permissions,  number  of  hard  links, owner name, group name,
	  size in bytes, and timestamp  (the  modification  time  unless
	  other times are selected).  For files with a time that is more
	  than 6 months old or more than 1 hour  into  the  future,  the
	  timestamp contains the year instead of the time of day.

     _-_m_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_c_o_m_m_a_s
	  List  files  horizontally,  with  as  many as will fit on each
	  line, separated by commas.

     _-_n_, _-_-_n_u_m_e_r_i_c_-_u_i_d_-_g_i_d
	  List the numeric UID and GID instead of the names.

     _-_p   Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.

     _-_q_, _-_-_h_i_d_e_-_c_o_n_t_r_o_l_-_c_h_a_r_s
	  Print question marks instead of nongraphic characters in  file
	  names.

     _-_r_, _-_-_r_e_v_e_r_s_e
	  Sort directory contents in reverse order.

     _-_s_, _-_-_s_i_z_e
	  Print  the  size  of each file in 1K blocks to the left of the
	  file name.  If the  environment  variable  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is
	  set, 512-byte blocks are used instead.

     _-_t_, _-_-_s_o_r_t_=_t_i_m_e
	  Sort  directory  contents  by  timestamp instead of alphabeti-
	  cally, with the newest files listed first.

     _-_u_, _-_-_t_i_m_e_=_a_t_i_m_e_, _-_-_t_i_m_e_=_a_c_c_e_s_s_, _-_-_t_i_m_e_=_u_s_e
	  Sort directory contents according to the  files'  last  access
	  time  instead  of  the modification time.  If the long listing
	  format is being used, print the last access  time  instead  of
	  the modification time.

     _-_x_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_a_c_r_o_s_s_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_h_o_r_i_z_o_n_t_a_l
	  List the files in columns, sorted horizontally.

     _-_A_, _-_-_a_l_m_o_s_t_-_a_l_l
	  List all files in directories except for `.' and `..'.

     _-_B_, _-_-_i_g_n_o_r_e_-_b_a_c_k_u_p_s
	  Do  not list files that end with `~', unless they are given on
	  the command line.

     _-_C_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_v_e_r_t_i_c_a_l
	  List files in columns, sorted vertically.

     _-_F_, _-_-_c_l_a_s_s_i_f_y
	  Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.
	  For regular files that are executable, append a `*'.  The file
	  type indicators are `/'  for  directories,  `@'  for  symbolic
	  links, `|' for FIFOs, `=' for sockets, and nothing for regular
	  files.

     _-_L_, _-_-_d_e_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
	  List the files linked to by symbolic links instead of  listing
	  the contents of the links.

     _-_N_, _-_-_l_i_t_e_r_a_l
	  Do not quote file names.

     _-_Q_, _-_-_q_u_o_t_e_-_n_a_m_e
	  Enclose file names in double quotes and quote nongraphic char-
	  acters as in C.

     _-_R_, _-_-_r_e_c_u_r_s_i_v_e
	  List the contents of all directories recursively.

     _-_S_, _-_-_s_o_r_t_=_s_i_z_e
	  Sort directory contents by file size  instead  of  alaphabeti-
	  cally, with the largest files listed first.

     _-_U_, _-_-_s_o_r_t_=_n_o_n_e
	  Do not sort directory contennts.

     _-_X_, _-_-_s_o_r_t_=_e_x_t_e_n_s_i_o_n
	  Sort  directory  contents  alphabetically  by  file  extension
	  (characters after the last `.'); files with no  extension  are
	  sorted first.

     _-_1_, _-_-_f_o_r_m_a_t_=_s_i_n_g_l_e_-_c_o_l_u_m_n
	  List one file per line.

     _-_w_, _-_-_w_i_d_t_h _c_o_l_s
	  Assume  the screen is _c_o_l_s columns wide.  The default is taken
	  from the terminal driver if possible; otherwise  the  environ-
	  ment  variable CCOOLLUUMMNNSS is used if it is set; otherwise the de-
	  fault is 80.

     _-_T_, _-_-_t_a_b_s_i_z_e _c_o_l_s
	  Assume that each tabstop is _c_o_l_s columns wide.  The default is
	  8.

     _-_I_, _-_-_i_g_n_o_r_e _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  Do  not list files whose names match the shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  unless they are given on the command line.  As in  the  shell,
	  an  initial `.' in a filename does not match a wildcard at the
	  start of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_.

BBUUGGSS
     On BSD systems, the _-_s option reports sizes that are half the  cor-
     rect  values for files that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems.  On
     HP-UX systems, it reports sizes that are twice the  correct  values
     for  files that are NFS-mounted from BSD systems.  This is due to a
     flaw in HP-UX; it also affects the HP-UX llss program.

     The long-named options can be introduced with `+' as well as  `--',
     for  compatibility  with previous releases.  Eventually support for
     `+' will be removed, because it is incompatible  with  the  POSIX.2
     standard.
