     ffiinndd [path...] [expression]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This manual page documents the GNU version of ffiinndd.  ffiinndd  searches
     the  directory tree rooted at each given pathname by evaluating the
     given expression from left to right,  according  to  the  rules  of
     precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the
     left hand side is false for _a_n_d operations, true for _o_r), at  which
     point ffiinndd moves on to the next pathname.

     The  first  argument that begins with `-', `(', `)', `,', or `!' is
     taken to be the beginning of the expression; any  arguments  before
     it  are paths to search, and any arguments after it are the rest of
     the expression.  If no paths are given, the  current  directory  is
     used.  If no expression is given, the expression `-print' is used.

     ffiinndd  exits  with status 0 if all files are processed successfully,
     greater than 0 if errors occur.

     The expression is made up of options (which affect  overall  opera-
     tion  rather than the processing of a specific file, and always re-
     turn true), tests (which return a true or false value), and actions
     (which  have  side  effects  and return a true or false value), all
     separated by operators.  -and is  assumed  where  the  operator  is
     omitted.   If the expression contains no actions other than -prune,
     -print is performed on all files for which the expression is true.

     OOPPTTIIOONNSS

     All options always return true.

     -daystart
	  Measure times (for -amin, -atime, -cmin,  -ctime,  -mmin,  and
	  -mtime)  from the beginning of today rather than from 24 hours
	  ago.

     -depth
	  Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.

     -follow
	  Dereference symbolic links.  Implies -noleaf.

     -maxdepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
	  Descend at most_ _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative integer) levels of  di-
	  rectories  below  the  command  line arguments.  `-maxdepth 0'
	  means only apply the tests and actions to the command line ar-
	  guments.

     -mindepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
	  Do  not  apply any tests or actions at levels less than _l_e_v_e_l_s
	  (a non-negative integer).  `-mindepth  1'  means  process  all
	  files except the command line arguments.

     -noleaf
	  Do  not  optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer
	  subdirectories than their hard link count.  Each directory  on
	  a  normal Unix filesystem has at least 2 hard links:  its name
	  and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its subdirectories (if  any)
	  each have a `..' entry linked to that directory.  When ffiinndd is
	  examining a directory, after it has statted 2 fewer  subdirec-
	  tories than the directory's link count, it knows that the rest
	  of the entries in the directory  are  non-directories  (`leaf'
	  files  in  the directory tree).  If only the files' names need
	  to be examined, there is no need to stat them;  this  gives  a
	  significant  increase  in  search speed.  However, this option
	  might be needed when searching NFS-mounted non-Unix file  sys-
	  tems,  if they do not follow the directory-link convention de-
	  scribed above.

     -version
	  Print ffiinndd version number on standard error.

     -xdev
	  Don't descend directories on other filesystems.

	  TTEESSTTSS

     Numeric arguments can be specified as

     _+_n   for greater than _n,

	  comes before -cnewer on the command line.

     -ctime _n
	  File's status was last changed _n*24 hours ago.

     -empty
	  File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

     -false
	  Always false.

     -fstype _t_y_p_e
	  File is on a filesystem of type _t_y_p_e.   The  valid  filesystem
	  types  vary  among  different  versions of Unix; an incomplete
	  list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version  of
	  Unix or another is:  ufs, 4.2, 4.3, nfs, tmp, mfs, S51K, S52K.

     -gid _n
	  File's numeric group ID is _n.

     -group _g_n_a_m_e
	  File belongs to group _g_n_a_m_e (numeric group ID allowed).

     -inum _n
	  File has inode number _n.

     -links _n
	  File has _n links.

     -lname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  File  is  a  symbolic  link whose contents match shell pattern
	  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The metacharacters do not  treat  `/'  or  `.'  spe-
	  cially.

     -mmin _n
	  File's data was last modified _n minutes ago.

     -mtime _n
	  File's data was last modified _n*24 hours ago.

     -name _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  Base  of  path name (the path with the leading directories re-
	  moved) matches  shell  pattern  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.   The  metacharacters
	  (`*',  `?',  and  `[]') do not match a `.' at the start of the
	  base name.

     -newer _f_i_l_e
	  File was modified more recently than _f_i_l_e.  -newer is affected
	  by  -follow only if -follow comes before -newer on the command
	  line.

     -nouser
	  No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

     -nogroup
	  No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

     -path _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  Path name matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.   The  metacharacters
	  do not treat `/' or `.' specially.

     -perm _m_o_d_e
	  File's  permission  bits are exactly_ _m_o_d_e (octal or symbolic).
	  Symbolic modes use mode 0 as a point of departure.

     -perm -_m_o_d_e
	  All of the permission bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.

     -perm +_m_o_d_e
	  Any of the permission bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.

     -regex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
	  Pathname matches regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

     -size _n[ck]
	  File uses _n 512-byte blocks (bytes if `c' follows _n, kilobytes
	  if  `k'  follows _n).  The size does not count indirect blocks,
	  and does count blocks in sparse files that  are  not  actually
	  allocated.

     -true
	  Always true.

     -type _c
	  File is of type _c:

     b    block (buffered) special

     c    character (unbuffered) special

     d    directory

     p    named pipe (FIFO)

     f    regular file

     l    symbolic link

     s    socket

     -uid _n
	  File's numeric user ID is _n.

     -used _n
	  File  was  last  accessed  _n  days  after  its status was last
	  changed.

     -user _u_n_a_m_e
	  File is owned by user _u_n_a_m_e (numeric user ID allowed).

     -xtype _c
	  The same as -type unless the file is  a  symbolic  link.   For
	  symbolic  links,  if  -follow  has not been given, true if the
	  file is a link to a file of type _c; if -follow has been given,
	  true  if _c is `l'.  For symbolic links, -xtype checks the type
	  of the file that -type does not check.

	  AACCTTIIOONNSS

     -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
	  Execute_ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d; true if 0 status is returned.  All  following
	  arguments to ffiinndd are taken to be arguments to the command un-
	  til an argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The  string
	  `{}'  is  replaced by the current pathname being processed ev-
	  erywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command,  not  just
	  in  arguments  where it is alone, as in some versions of ffiinndd.
	  Both of these constructions might need to be escaped  (with  a
	  `') or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.

     -fprint _f_i_l_e
	  True;  print  the  full pathname into file _f_i_l_e.  If _f_i_l_e does
	  not exist when ffiinndd is run, it is created; if it  does  exist,
	  it   is   truncated.    The   filenames   ``/dev/stdout''  and
	  ``/dev/stderr'' are handled specially; they refer to the stan-
	  dard output and standard error output, respectively.

     -fprint0 _f_i_l_e
	  True; like -print0 but write to _f_i_l_e like -fprint.

     -fprintf _f_i_l_e _f_o_r_m_a_t
	  True; like -printf but write to _f_i_l_e like -fprint.

     -ok _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
	  Like  -exec but ask the user first (on the standard input); if
	  the response does not start with `y' or `Y', do  not  run  the
	  command, and return false.

     -print
	  True; print the full pathname on the standard output, followed
	  by a newline.

     -print0
	  True; print the full pathname on the standard output, followed
	  by  a null character.  This allows filenames that contain new-
	  lines to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the
	  ffiinndd output.

     -printf _f_o_r_m_a_t
	  True; print_ _f_o_r_m_a_t on the standard output, interpreting `' es-
	  capes and `%' directives.  Field widths and precisions can  be
	  specified  as  with  the  `printf' C function.  Unlike -print,
	  -printf does not add a newline at the end of the string.   The
	  escapes and directives are:

     a    Alarm bell.

     b    Backspace.

     c    Stop printing from this format immediately.

     f    Form feed.

     n    Newline.

     r    Carriage return.

     t    Horizontal tab.

     v    Vertical tab.

     A    literal backslash (`').

     A `' character followed by any other character is treated as an or-
     dinary character, so they both are printed.

     %%   A literal percent sign.

     %a   File's last access time  in  the  format  returned  by  the  C
	  `ctime' function.

     %A_k  File's last access time in the format specified by _k, which is
	  either `@' or a directive for the C `strftime' function.   The
	  possible values for _k are listed below; some of them might not
	  be available on all systems, due to differences in  `strftime'
	  between systems.
