                                    AUTOCON

                                  Introduction

   Definitions:

     In order to describe AutoCon, I need to establish a couple of
     definitions.  When I use the word "reconfigure", I mean the
     process of updating the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files on the
     boot drive, followed by an optional reboot of the system.

     When I use the word "configuration", I am referring to an
     AUTOEXEC/CONFIG combination held in a record of AutoCon's
     database.  You will use AutoCon to set up these combinations, and
     give each of them a familiar name.

     The ^ symbol denotes the Control key, so ^F3 means hitting the
     Control and the F3 key at the same time.  Alt denotes the Alt key
     (tricky, huh?), so that AltR means hitting the Alt and the R key
     at the same time.  ENTER (all caps) denotes hitting the Enter key.


   Description:

     AutoCon is essentially a database manager for your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     and CONFIG.SYS files.  It enables you to keep up to fifty
     different configurations, and to change easily between those
     configurations.

     The first time you run AutoCon, it will create a file named
     AUTOCON.DAT.  That file will contain five configuration records.
     Each record will contain a copy of the AUTOEXEC.BAT and
     CONFIG.SYS files from the C: drive.  The records are initially
     named RECORD01 - RECORD05.  When you set up a configuration for a
     specific purpose, you can change the name to reflect that purpose
     (something like Win3 for a Microsoft Windows configuration, and
     SDOS for a simple DOS configuration).  You can add more records by
     hitting the F3 key.

     AutoCon incorporates a full-screen editor to make it easy to
     change the AUTOEXEC/CONFIG records.  The editor uses Turbo
     IDE/Sidekick/WS-compatible keystrokes.  If you are not familiar
     with these, there is an on-line help file which details all the
     keystrokes.  If you desire, you can change the editor keystrokes.
     The F6 key will pop up a key editor for this purpose.

     If you don't like the built-in editor, you can configure AutoCon
     to use a different one.  The ^F6 key combination will pop up a
     window asking for the name of the editor you wish to run.  Since
     the configurations will eventually be used as AUTOEXEC.BAT and
     CONFIG.SYS files, the editor must be able to produce pure ASCII
     files.  You can toggle between the internal and external editors
     with the ^F6 and the ShiftF6 key combinations.
     After you have established your records and names, you can
     reconfigure your system by entering the name of the new
     configuration on the command line.  Typing "AutoCon Win3" would
     cause AutoCon to copy the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG fields of the
     record named Win3 into the boot drive as AUTOEXEC.BAT and
     CONFIG.SYS and optionally reboot the system.

     In the interactive mode, you can page through the records and
     reconfigure (using the current on-screen configuration) with a
     couple of keystrokes.

     The AutoCon package also includes a device driver which will
     allow you to select different configurations during the boot
     process. Using this method is optional, and you can switch
     between the two methods with a couple of key strokes.


   Why AutoCon for Configuration Control:

     Three programs were initially responsible for the creation of
     AutoCon: my schematic program, my scanner program, and my
     programmable logic compiler.  Each of these programs require
     various device drivers, and almost 600k of memory.  When the
     computer is configured to run one of the three, neither of the
     other two will run; in addition, if the computer is configured the
     way I like to work with it, _none_ of the three will run.  After
     playing with batch files for a while, I decided to write a program
     to make it easy to change configurations.

     The above scenario is responsible for the default of five records
     in AutoCon.  I had a regular configuration, the three special
     configurations, and one for experimentation.  After I had worked
     with AutoCon for a few days, I told a few of my friends about the
     program and they wanted to try it.  After some very positive
     feedback, I decided to try the program out in the Shareware
     community.

     An unexpected bonus of using AutoCon became evident when I
     received programs with automatic installation modules -- you know,
     the ones that like to mess around with your AUTOEXEC and CONFIG
     files.  Since your configurations are stored in a database, a
     change to the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files doesn't cause a problem.

     I'll use Windows to demonstrate.  When I got Windows, and saw
     what it was going to do to my system configuration, I used my
     "Simple" configuration to reconfigure my system.  This
     configuration has only the basic stuff in it (path, prompt,
     files, and buffers).  I then let Windows install itself.  After
     the installation was finished, I called up AutoCon and created a
     new configuration containing the changes Windows had made. After
     playing with Windows for a while, I went back to my favorite DOS
     configuration in a matter of moments.  Now, whenever I want to
     run Windows, I just type "AutoCon Win3" on the command line --
     and it's up and running!
                         INSTALLING AUTOCON

   New Installation:

     To do a new installation of AutoCon, you need to copy four files
     (AUTOCON.EXE, AUTOCON.HLP, MENU.CTL, and MENUNUM.COM) to your
     hard disk.  It doesn't really matter which subdirectory you copy
     them into, as long as it's included in the PATH statement.  If
     you like to have files relating to booting up (such as device
     drivers) in your root directory, then MENU.CTL and MENUNUM.COM
     should be placed there, otherwise all four files may be placed in
     the same subdirectory.  When AutoCon is started, it will first
     look in the current subdirectory for its Help and data files.  If
     they are not there, then AutoCon (if you are using DOS 3.3+) will
     search the subdirectory it was started from.  If they are not
     _there_, then AutoCon will search the PATH.  As long as the Help
     and data files are in the PATH (or in the subdirectory AutoCon
     was started from - DOS 3.3+), AutoCon can be installed in any
     subdirectory.

     After you have copied the files, change to the subdirectory
     AUTOCON.EXE was copied to, and type "AUTOCON" ENTER.  You will now
     be in the interactive mode, pointing to the name of the first
     configuration.  This first configuration is a special one to
     AutoCon.  Several of the default parameters are stored in this
     configuration.  When you make changes to the first record, you
     will be asked whether you want to copy those changes across all
     the records.

   IMPORTANT:  If you are currently using a disk cache program that
     buffers disk writes (PC-KWIK and PCTOOLS are two that I know of),
     you need to set up AutoCon to flush the cache before it reboots.
     Hit the F4 key, select "Yes", then enter the command (include the
     path if necessary) that causes your cache program to flush its
     buffers.  In the case of PC-KWIK, it is the PC-KWIK program name
     followed by /F.  AutoCon will execute this program before
     reconfiguring.

     AutoCon is now installed, and ready to use.


   Update:

     If your current AutoCon version is below 2.0 then the new
     capabilities of AutoCon require a change to the AUTOCON.DAT file,
     so if you are updating to V2.0x of AutoCon from 1.x you have a
     little more to do: you need to copy the same four files mentioned
     above to the subdirectory where the older version of AutoCon
     (which will be overwritten) is installed.  There is another new
     file in the AutoCon package called ACONVERT.EXE.  You need to
     change to the subdirectory where AUTOCON.DAT resides, then run the
     ACONVERT program.  This program will rename AUTOCON.DAT to
     AUTOCON.SAV, then convert the file structure to work under AutoCon
     V2.0x.  After you run ACONVERT.EXE, you no longer need the
     ACONVERT.EXE file, so it can be deleted.

     The editor has a few new capabilities which will not be available
     until you change the editor keys.  Call up AutoCon, then hit the
     F6 key.  If you have never changed the keys, hit AltR, and
     answer "Yes" to restoring the default keystrokes.  If you have
     changed the keystrokes, page down to the bottom of the key list;
     you will see that there are some new keys that need to be
     defined.

     In either case, after copying the files, you will need to start
     AutoCon and hit the F2 key.  Answer yes to update the files to the
     new version.

                          MENU.CTL & MENUNUM.COM

     The addition of these two files to the AutoCon package changes
     its capabilities so much that I decided to skip versions 1.5 -
     1.9 and go directly to version 2.0.  MENU.CTL is a device driver
     which modifies the way a CONFIG.SYS file is processed by DOS.  It
     allows AutoCon to set up a menu selection system which can be
     activated during the boot process.  There are both advantages and
     disadvantages to this capability; the major advantage is that you
     can pick the configuration you want to use during the boot
     process.

     The major disadvantage is that your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
     files become quite nonstandard.  If you want four choices to be
     available to you during the boot, then all four configurations
     must be embedded in the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files.  Programs like
     Optimize (QEMM utility) will get very confused trying to work
     with these files; most automatic installation programs will not
     be able to work with them, either.

     I've designed AutoCon to be able to switch between the boot "menu"
     mode and the "single" mode with just a couple of keystrokes; this
     should provide the best of both worlds.  When a program like
     Optimize (or perhaps the Windows installation program) needs to
     work with your AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files, change to the single
     configuration mode.  After the program is finished, call up
     AutoCon, save the results in one of your configurations, and go
     back to the menu mode.


   MENU.CTL:
     AutoCon handles all the nitty-gritty details of interfacing to
     MENU.CTL.  The only thing you have to do is make sure that
     MENU.CTL and MENUNUM.COM are in a subdirectory included in the
     PATH statement.  To set up MENU.CTL, start AutoCon in the
     interactive mode (just type "AUTOCON" ENTER), then hit the AltM
     key combination; this will pop up a configuration menu.  Select
     the configurations you want in the boot-up menu by moving the
     highlite bar over the ones you want, and hit the Enter key.  The
     selected configurations will have a check mark in the first
     column.  When you've finished selecting configurations, hit the
     Escape key.  AutoCon will then ask how many seconds you want to
     delay (see the following note).  Enter a number from 0 to 9.

     You will now be back in the main interactive screen.  Hit the F2
     key to reconfigure the system using MENU.CTL (the record on the
     screen will be made the boot default record -- if it was not one
     of the selected records, it will be added to the default list).
     The next time you boot, MENU.CTL will take control of the
     CONFIG.SYS file.  If you hit a key in the default time, you will
     be able to choose from the configurations you selected.

     To go back to a single configuration, start AutoCon in the
     interactive mode, and hit the AltS key combination.  Change to the
     configuration  you want to boot with, hit the F2 key, and
     you're reconfigured,

     You will always be able to tell which mode AutoCon is in by
     looking at the bottom line on the screen in the interactive mode.
     If it says MENU.CTL you are in (boot) Menu mode, and if it says
     SINGLE you are in Single Mode.

   Time:
     When you select Menu mode, you will be asked to select how many
     seconds to wait during the boot process; you may enter from 0
     (the default) to 9.  If you select 0, when you see the MENU.CTL
     box pop up, you will have about a second to hit a key.  If you do
     hit a key in this time, the menu selection will be placed on the
     screen.  If not, the boot will continue with the default record.

     If you select any number except 0, you will see the following
     messages on the screen during the boot process:

       Press Esc to select -- the default record name will be here --

       Press any other key to select a different configuration. Time =

     with a decrementing number (starting with the time chosen from
     AutoCon) following the = sign.  When the time goes to 0, or the
     Esc key is hit, the default record will be used to continue
     the boot.

     In either case, if a key is hit, the menu choices will be placed
     on the screen and you will be able to choose the one you want with
     the arrow keys.  The one the arrow is pointing to when the ENTER
     key is hit will be the configuration used for the boot process.

   Colors:
     If you don't like the colors that MENU.CTL uses when it takes
     control of the boot process, you can change them using the pull
     down menu in AutoCon.  Start AutoCon, and hit the AltB
     combination.  The four colors used by AutoCon can be changed with
     this menu.  Select the colors you would like MENU.CTL to use, then
     write out the new configuration (usually with the F2 key).


   XMAEM.SYS:
     I don't have DOS 4.0, so I don't really have experience with this
     device driver.  From reading PC Magazine, I know that DOS
     processes this device driver out of sequence in the CONFIG.SYS
     file.  As a consequence, MENU.CTL will not be able to control it.


   MSDOS 5.0's High and UMB flags:
     Microsoft added a couple of capabilities to DOS 5.0 that pose a
     special problem for MENU.CTL.  These are the DOS=HIGH/LOW and
     DOS=UMB/NOUMB flags.  DOS processes these flags out of sequence,
     so that by the time MENU.CTL has taken over, it has already set
     itself up for their use.  DOS decides how to set the flags by
     parsing the entire CONFIG.SYS file, and using the state of the
     last occurrence of the DOS= statement to set the flags.

     AutoCon is still able to control these flags  though the method is
     a little unorthodox.  When you are using Menu mode and MSDOS 5.0,
     AutoCon will place the statement DOS=HIGH,NOUMB as the last line
     in the CONFIG.SYS file.  As a consequence, DOS will attempt to
     always load HIGH, and have NOUMB control.  When you select a
     configuration via MENU.CTL, if that configuration has a DOS=LOW
     command in it (and no other program in the configuration has taken
     it), MENU.CTL will take the HMA and force DOS Low.  The HMA will
     be released by MENUNUM runs (as soon as the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
     starts executing).  If the selected configuration has a DOS=UMB
     command, then MENU.CTL will tell DOS to control the UMBs.

     If all of this makes no sense to you, then don't worry about it.
     If you are using MSDOS 5.0 and the Menu mode, just place the
     appropriate DOS=HIGH/LOW and DOS=UMB/NOUMB commands in each of
     your configurations, and AutoCon will do the rest.


   DRDOS:
     As of this release MENU.CTL (Version 1.4 or higher) if fully DRDOS
     compatible.


   CONFIG:
     When you switch to the Menu mode, AutoCon will do all of the work
     for you.  It will take your selected configurations (up to 8) and
     create the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files that will allow you
     to choose during the boot process.  If you look at the CONFIG.SYS
     file that has been set up for a boot menu, you will see all the
     selected CONFIG fields embedded in the files with DEVICE=MENU.CTL
     at the beginning of the file.  When MENU.CTL is processed by DOS,
     it will take over and allow you to choose the configuration you
     want.  After you choose, MENU.CTL will leave the chosen
     configuration intact and disable the rest.

     If you are using DOS 4.0+, MENU.CTL disables by changing the
     CONFIG.SYS commands to remarks.  If you are using DOS 3.3 or
     below, it will disable the commands by turning them into
     BREAK=OFF commands.  As a consequence, if you are using a DOS
     below 4.0, you will need to make a couple of changes to your
     CONFIG commands.  In order to have the room to convert the
     LASTDRIVE, FILES, and BUFFERS commands, you will need to make the
     lines longer.

     I do this by adding an * at the end of the line, as follows:
       LASTDRIVE=M: * BUFFERS=10 * FILES=50 *

     If you don't do this, these commands will be disabled by making
     them unrecognized.  This doesn't cause a problem: you will just
     see a lot of "Unrecognized command in CONFIG.SYS" lines coming
     out during the boot process.

     Note: AutoCon will also change "Unrecognized" commands to
     BREAK=OFF commands if there is room.  This will allow you to
     freely place REM statements in your CONFIG.SYS file (as long as
     you use MENU mode).

     If you want BREAK=ON, you will have to add it to your AUTOEXEC
     fields.

   AUTOEXEC:
     The AUTOEXEC.BAT file will also contain all the selected
     configurations AUTOEXEC fields.  At the beginning of the file
     will be MENUNUM.COM.  This program will interrogate MENU.CTL and
     find which configuration was chosen.  MENUNUM will set ERRORLEVEL
     to match the chosen menu, and an "If" statement will cause the
     associated AUTOEXEC to be chosen.

   UNRECOGNIZED COMMANDS - DOS 3.3:
     CONFIG.SYS files have a potential problem.  If you enter the
     following two lines in your CONFIG.SYS file

       REM
       DEVICE=ANSI.SYS

     ANSI.SYS will not get loaded.  Both lines will be turned into an
     "Unrecognized command".  This is just something that DOS does,
     and there is nothing an outside program can do about it.

     Do not end a CONFIG field with an Unrecognized command.  If you
     do, the following command will also be Unrecognized, and will
     definitely mess up the processing of the CONFIG.SYS file.

   CAUTION: When you start playing around with the Menu mode, be very
     careful when updating or creating a configuration.  If you read
     in an AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS file which has been set up for
     MENU mode, it will contain a lot of commands which will cause
     problems if you use it in a reconfiguration.  It would be much
     better to copy one of the other configurations and not update
     from the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files.

     If you have managed to read and save such a configurations, you
     will need to edit and remove the extra statements inserted by
     AutoCon.  If it is not obvious to you by looking at the AUTOEXEC
     and CONFIG fields which statements these are, then do not attempt
     to edit the field, simply copy one of the other configurations.

   Magazine Article:
     Just as a side note, during the development of MENU.CTL I created
     a simpler device driver and decided it would make a good subject
     for a magazine article (similar to PC Magazine's CONFIG.CTL
     device driver).  I wrote it up, and it was published in the Sept.
     1991 issue of Tech Specialist.



                         NAVIGATING AUTOCON


     Okay, now you have AutoCon installed; how do you use it?  Starting
     with version 2.0, the interactive front screen of AutoCon can be
     navigated with a pull-down menu.  If you need to do something and
     can't remember the keystroke combination to get there, use the
     menu to find it.  On the right of each menu entry is the shortcut
     key combination to perform the same operation.  I am going to
     define the navigation keys in the form of the pull-down menu.

   DataBase Maintenance (Records AltR)

     Previous/Next, browse records:
       PgUp/PgDn allows you to page through the records one at a time.

     pIck Record:
       F10 pops up a pick-list of all the configurations, and allows
       you to choose one and make it current.

     Create Record:
       F3 creates a new record, and copies the control structure from
       record 1 and the data from the current AUTOEXEC and CONFIG
       files.

     Delete Record:
       ^F3 deletes the current configuration record.  Note that you
       cannot delete record number 1, nor can you delete below the
       default 5 records.

     Read Files:
       F7 will cause the current record to be updated with the
       contents of the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files.

     Read file into AUTOEXEC (rd Auto ^F8):
       ^F8 will pop up a window asking for a file name to read into
       the AUTOEXEC field.  In you enter wildcards, a list of file
       names will be popped up to choose from.  The AUTOEXEC field of
       the current record will be replaced by the contents of the
       chosen file.

     Read file into CONFIG (rd confiG ^F9):
       ^F9 will pop up a window asking for a file name to read into
       the CONFIG field.  In you enter wildcards, a list of file names
       will be popped up to choose from.  The CONFIG field of the
       current record will be replaced by the contents of the chosen
       file.

     Configure and continue:
       ^K^D will cause all current changes to be saved.  In other
       words, it will rewrite the AUTOCON.DAT file, the AUTOEXEC.BAT
       file, and the CONFIG.SYS file.

     Change BAT drive:
       F8 will pop up a window to allow you to change the file the
       AUTOEXEC field of a configuration is written too.  The default
       name is C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT.

     Change SYS drive:
       F8 will pop up a window to allow you to change the file the
       CONFIG field of a configuration is written to.  The default
       name is C:\CONFIG.SYS.

     cOmpare:
       Alt= will compare the current configuration with the contents of
       the current AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files.  It should be noted that,
       if you are using the MENU.CTL device driver option, this
       comparison will probably not be applicable.

     boot Type:
       F5 will pop up a window to allow you to change the boot type
       associated with a configuration.  The choices are Warm, Cold,
       None, and External.

     Flush:
       F4 will pop up a window that will allow you to associate a
       cache Flush command with the current configuration record. This
       is necessary when the cache used in the configuration does a
       write cache operation (PC-KWIK and PCTOOLS both default to this
       configuration).

     cLone:
       AltC will allow you to clone (or copy) the contents/control
       of one of the other configurations to the current
       configuration. It will pop up a pick list of all of the
       existing configurations, and allow you to pick the one to copy
       from.

       If you are using the AutoCon environment variable, you will
       need to edit the AUTOEXEC file, and make sure the correct name
       is used.

     Update:
       ^K^S will save all current record changes to the AUTOCON.DAT
       database file.  Note that it will not update the AUTOEXEC and
       CONFIG Files.  You must use ^K^D for that.

     rEstore:
       ^K^R will abandon all changes you have made (since the last
       AUTOCON.DAT save) and reload the database records from the
       AUTOCON.DAT file.


   Boot Operation (Boot AltB):

     Single:
       AltS configures AUTOCON to use only the current record for
       reconfiguration purposes.

     Menu:
       AltM configures AutoCon to use MENU.CTL in conjunction with
       MENUNUM.COM to set up a selection menu to be used during the
       boot process.  A pick list of the current configurations will
       be popped up, and you will be able to choose up to eight
       default configurations to be included.  After you have chosen
       the eight, you will be asked how many seconds to delay during
       the boot process.  If a number other than 0 is entered, a
       message will be placed on the screen during the boot process,
       and MENU.CTL will wait that many seconds for a key to be hit.

       Boot Frame:
         When booting under menu mode, MENU.CTL pops up some windows
         and this selection allows you to change the color of the
         window frames of those pop up windows.

       Boot Text:
         When booting under menu mode, MENU.CTL pops up some windows
         and this selection allows you to change the color of the text
         in those pop up windows.

       Boot Attention:
         When booting under menu mode, MENU.CTL pops up some windows
         and this selection allows you to change the color of the text
         used to draw your attention.  This is the color of the
         decrementing time variable, and the color that will be used
         for warning messages.

       Boot Hi_Lite:
         When booting under menu mode, MENU.CTL pops up some windows
         and this selection allows you to change the color of the
         moving selection hi-lite bar used to select a boot
         configuration.


   Editor options (Editor AltE):

     Internal:
       ShiftF6 configures the current configuration to use the
       internal editor.

     External:
       ^F6 configures the current configuration to use an external
       editor.  A window will pop up asking for the editor's name. You
       may include a path in the name, but you must include the
       extension (e.g., WORD.EXE or C:\WORD\WORD.EXE).  The next time
       you edit the AUTOEXEC or CONFIG field for this record, if the
       external editor can be found it will be used.  If it can't be
       found, AutoCon will switch back to the internal editor.

       After the external editor has been installed, it will be used
       to edit the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG fields from the main screen.
       When you move the cursor to the AUTOEXEC or CONFIG field and
       press enter, AutoCon will copy the current record to the
       current subdirectory as XYZXYZZ.XYZ (the current subdirectory
       must contain at least 4k of disk space).  AutoCon then shells
       to DOS with the editor name and filename on the command line
       (e.g., WS.EXE XYZXYZZ.XYZ).  When you exit your editor, AutoCon
       should restart.  It will copy the XYZXYZZ.XYZ file into the
       AUTOEXEC field of the current record and delete the XYZXYZZ.XYZ
       file from the subdirectory.


       CAUTION!!  Just to make sure there is no problem with your
       editor, create a new record and work with it first, before
       taking the chance of harming one of your current records. You
       may want to make a copy of your AUTOCON.DAT file and store it
       in a safe place until you've verified the operation of the new
       release.  In fact, you should always keep a backup copy of
       AUTOEXEC.DAT.


     Install Keys:
       F6 will pop up a window that will allow you to change the
       keystrokes used in the internal editor.  F6 may also be used
       while in the internal editor to see exactly which key performs
       which function.

     Save Keys:
       This function is really added for future action (though it is
       fully functional in this release).  If you have modified the 
       keystrokes to emulate your favorite work processor, how about 
       saving them, then upload them to my BBS.  

     Get Keys:
       This function will allow you to change AutoCon's editor
       keystrokes quickly by reading in a keystroke file.


   coLors AltL:

     Frame:
       AltF1 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the frames drawn around the windows on the main
       interactive screen.

     Frame Text:
       AltF2 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the text in the windows on the main screen.

     Background:
       AltF3 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the text and/or background of the main screen.

     Field:
       AltF4 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the fields that get updated on the screen, the
       configuration name, the date and time, the record number, and
       the select boxes.

     Prompt:
       AltF5 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the current select box.  This is the color of the
       main screen select item that the cursor is positioned to.

     Edit Text:
       AltF6 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the text used in the editor.

     Marked Text:
       AltF7 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color of the text used to show marked blocks in the editor.

     Ctrl Text:
       AltF8 pops up a color pick window which allows you to change
       the color used to show control characters (value < 20 hex) in
       the edit text.

     Menu Frame:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of the frame
       around the pulldown menus.  Note that there is no hotkey.

     Menu Text:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of menu items in
       the pulldown menus.  Note that there is no hotkey.

     Menu Select:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of the currently
       selected item in the pulldown menus.  Note that there is no
       hotkey.

     Menu Hi-lite:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of the Hi-lited
       select character in the pulldown menus.  Note that there is no
       hotkey.

     Help fRame:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of the Frame drawn
       around the Help Window (also changes the color of one of the
       basic Help Hi-Lite color).

     Help tExt:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of the text in the
       Help Window.

     Help heAder:
       This menu item allows you to change the color of the Header on
       the Help window.  It will also be the default color of the Help
       menu select color.

     Default:
       AltF10 pops up a color pick window which allows you to
       change all configurable colors back to the defaults.  If your
       screen goes black, hit AltF10 followed by the Y key, and you
       may be able to see the screen again.


   Quit AltQ :

     Configure:
       F2 reconfigures the system.  It will save any record changes in
       the database file, and create new AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files. It
       will then perform the requested reboot.

     Reboot:
       This menu item will cause any record changes to be saved in the
       database file, and force the default reboot action.  Note that
       there is no hotkey.

     Exit:
       This menu item will save any record changes in the database
       file and exit without any reboot action -- a rough equivalent
       to hitting the ESC key.

     Abandon/Exit:
       ^K^Q will cause any current record changes to be abandoned, and
       AutoCon will exit without any reboot action.

     Restore Screen?:
       This function can only be reached through the pull down menu.
       If you set this to "NO", then AutoCon will not attempt to
       restore the original screen on exit.  Some video combinations
       seem to have a problem with the restoration, so you can turn it
       off.


   Keys not in the Menu:

     AltV :
       This key combination will show you the DOS screen as it was
       when AutoCon was activated.




                             COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

   Environment:
     For AutoCon to work correctly with the command-line commands, it
     will need to know which configuration was used for the last boot-
     up.  There is only one sure way for AutoCon to get this
     information: if you are using the Menu mode, MENU.CTL will be
     able to tell AutoCon which configuration was chosen.

     If you are using the Single mode, to make sure that AutoCon knows
     which configuration was used to boot, you need to add a line to
     your AUTOEXEC fields.  The line is as follows:

       SET AUTOCON=<Configuration Name>

     in which "configuration name" is the name that shows up on the
     front screen in the interactive mode.  To make it very easy, a
     new key-stroke command was added to the editor.  The default key
     is AltE. Place your cursor at the position in the AUTOEXEC
     field where your other SET commands are located, and press the
     AltE combination.  AutoCon will insert the proper line in the
     file.


   Reconfigure:
     To reconfigure from the command line, type

                  AUTOCON <update name> ENTER
           [e.g., AUTOCON WIN3 ENTER]

     on the command line.  As long as AUTOCON.EXE and AUTOCON.DAT are
     in the path, the configuration will be updated, and your system
     will be rebooted (depending on the current boot choice).

     Alternatively (if you don't want to type the update name), if you
     type AUTOCON / ENTER

     AutoCon will pop up a pick list of your configurations, and you
     can use the arrow keys to pick a reboot configuration.

     If the update name is the same as the last boot name (see note
     above), you will be asked if you really want to do the update.


   Configuration Inquiry:
     Typing AUTOCON /? will cause AutoCon to display the name it
     thinks is the current configuration.

     This will be most accurate if Menu mode is active.  It should
     also be quite accurate if each AUTOEXEC field has the correct
     "SET AUTOCON=" command in it.

     If neither of the above applies, it will tell you which command
     was last used to configure the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG files, which
     may not be the configuration that was used for the last boot.


   Specific Update:
     Typing           AUTOCON /<update name> ENTER
               [e.g., AUTOCON /WIN3 ENTER]

     will cause the named configuration to be updated from the current
     C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT and C:\CONFIG.SYS files (or your selected BAT and
     SYS filenames).  If MENU.CTL is in use, you will be asked if this
     is really what you want to do.

   Generic Update:
     For those of you who like to live dangerously (all of us from
     time to time?), typing "AUTOCON /*" will update the current
     configuration (the last one used to reconfigure) from the current
     C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT and C:\CONFIG.SYS files (or your selected
     filenames).  This command will be ignored if the system was
     booted with MENU.CTL.

   Equal Check:
     Typing "AUTOCON /=" will report on whether or not the current
     configuration record is equal to the current record in the
     database.

   Batch File Errorlevel Check:
     Typing "AUTOCON/@<configuration name>" will set the Errorlevel to
     1 if "<configuration name>" was the one used to boot the system.
     This function will set the errorlevel only: there will be nothing
     shown on the screen.  For full accuracy, see the Environment note
     above.



                              NOTES AND HINTS



     Editor Keys:

       I will be enhancing the editor in the next release, so I'm not
       going to expend a lot of energy on the Editor Help function in
       this one.  To find which key does what when you are in the
       editor, hit F6 and you will see each action the editor is
       capable of and the key assigned to that action.  You may also
       change the default keys while in this mode.  The next release
       will add pulldown menus and a much better Help section to the
       editor.

       If you are unable to call up the Edit Key function while in the
       editor, go back to the main screen, hit F6 to pop up the key
       editor, hit END, and you will see a function called Install
       Editor Keys.  Assign the default F6 key to this function -- or
       any other key you like.  If you assign another key, the F6 key
       will still call up the editor from the main screen, and the
       assigned key will work inside the editor.


     Boot Notes:

       Versions of AutoCon before 2.0 allowed one boot choice for all
       configurations.  From this version on, you will be able to
       select a boot choice for each configuration.

       AutoCon is initially configured with a warm (or soft) reboot.
       Some machines have a problem with the warm boot (usually those
       with a large hard disk, and a large hard-disk partition
       manager) and need a cold boot instead.  If you have a reboot
       problem, hit F5 and change to a cold boot.  This change will be
       saved in the AUTOCON.DAT file, and AutoCon will perform a cold
       boot (you'll see the memory being checked) in the future.

       Some hardware is so strange (or the software has put the CPU
       into such a strange state -- Windows 3 386Enhanced mode) that
       even a software cold boot doesn't suffice.  If this is the
       case, then hit F5 and change to no boot.  This last will
       require hitting ^AltDel after AutoCon is finished.

       A couple of add-in processor cards (plugging a 286 expansion
       card into an XT) come with their own reboot program, and some
       people have developed their own reboot utilities to handle
       special hardware and/or software needs.  For these people,
       there is another choice for rebooting.  They will need to hit
       F5 and change to an External Boot.  You will need to enter the
       program name that performs your reboot.


     BAT and SYS Files:

       AutoCon is initially configured to copy the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG
       fields to the C drive.  For various reasons, some people do
       their real boot from a drive other than C.  The F8 key will
       allow you to change the designated drive (and file name) the
       AUTOEXEC field is copied too.  The F9 key performs the same
       function for the CONFIG field.  The new destination files will
       be saved to the AUTOCON.DAT file, and used in all future
       configurations until you change them again.

       Starting with this version, the BAT and SYS files will be set
       with each configuration.  Until I make some large changes in
       the next version, this will allow you to edit (and keep a
       database of) files other than the AUTOEXEC and CONFIG.

     LCD Users:

       If you have a computer with an LCD screen, set your mode to
       BW80 (this is mode 2 for you technical people) before starting
       AutoCon; that should make the screen show up better.  If you
       prefer, you can start in color mode, and edit the colors to
       something you find suitable.

     Screen Information:

       When you are in the data-entry mode, you have some information
       on the screen.  The top line has the current date and time, as
       well as the name and version of the program.  The second line
       has the information on the current record, specifically the
       record number, and the date and time it was last changed.  The
       middle of the screen has an area for notes, so that you can
       keep track of what this particular record is used for.  The
       bottom two lines contain help information for the current mode.

       The %<number> on the bottom line of the note frame and of the
       edit frame indicates the how full the field is.  An empty note
       field is 0% full.  As you add note characters, the percentage
       will increase.  (I've had some people ask.)

       The bottom line has some status information about the current
       defaults.  The first word on the line will be MENU.CTL or
       SINGLE.  This indicates whether you are using the device driver
       to select a configuration during the boot, or whether only a
       single configuration is available.

       The second word is either Internal or External; that indicates
       whether the internal or the external editor is to be used for
       this configuration.  The next term is either Flush or No Flush;
       that indicates whether or not a Cache Flush command will be
       performed for this configuration.  The Next word tells what
       type of boot will be performed for this configuration; the word
       will be either Warm, Cold, None, or External.  There may or may
       not be a last word.  If this record will be one of the default
       records used with MENU.CTL, then "Selected" will be written on
       the screen.


     Old Configurations:
       If you want to use some configurations you have already
       defined, and you are using the internal editor, you may read
       them in directly.  While in the AUTOEXEC or CONFIG edit mode,
       if you hit F5 it will erase the contents of this field, but it
       checks with you first.  If you then hit ^K ENTER, you will be
       given a chance to enter a file name to read into the field.  If
       you use wildcard notation, AutoCon will pop up a file list for
       you to choose from.  The selected file name will then be read
       into the current field.  Do one of the standard exit commands
       (AltX, ^K X) and the field now contains the file.

       Do this for each of your current configurations, and you will
       now have the convenience of AutoCon with all your standard
       configurations.

       Alternately -- especially for those of you using an External
       editor -- you may read in a file from the main screen.  The ^F8
       key combination will allow you to specify a file name to copy
       into the current AUTOEXEC field, and ^F9 performs the same
       function for the CONFIG field.


     LZEXE:
       A new program from France has shown up on the scene; it is
       called LZEXE.  If you use it on AUTOCON.EXE, it will reduce the
       size about fifty percent.  I am distributing the AUTOCON.EXE
       file in the LZEXE format.  If you have an XT compatible
       machine, then AutoCon may run too slow for you in this format.
       If this is the case, you can use the program UNLZEXE to restore
       it to its uncompressed format.  Both LZEXE and UNLZEXE are
       included as a bonus on the registered disk.


     PKLITE:
       Phil Katz has also written a program which will reduce the size
       of program files.  It is also completely compatible with AutoCon.

     DIET:
       There is also a Japanese file compressor called DIET.  AutoCon
       has also been tested and found compatible with DIET.
                                CONTACT


     If you have a problem getting AutoCon set up, or if you find a bug
     please let me know immediately.  The primary ways to contact me
     are to call my office at (916) 623 5045 or (if you have a modem)
     my 24 hour BBS at (916) 623 4455.  The modem on the BBS is a 
     9600 BAUD CompuCom Speedmodem Star.  It supports CSP, V32, and V42 
     protocols.

     You may also contact me on CompuServe at 72460,3072 or on GEnie
     as L.WEAVER1.  I check them both at least once a week, and I'm
     quite often on CompuServe two or three times a week.

     I'm also open to suggestions for improving AutoCon.  A lot of the
     current features have been the result of requests made by my
     users.



                                  FUTURE

     I think that AutoCon is maturing as a program, and that its
     direction is becoming clear.  It has changed so much from the
     original release that I doubt anyone running version 1.0 would
     recognize it as the same program.

     Where is AutoCon going in the future?  Well, I have several ideas
     in mind for enhancements.  You will also have a hand in the
     future directions.  I have discovered that I can't anticipate all
     of your needs.  You will have to tell me what changes and
     enhancements you would most like to see.

     The biggest set of enhancements I have in mind will concern the
     editor.  I had a lot of ideas for this release which did not pan
     out; you can check the Changes file for the reasons why.  I will
     add a pulldown menu system to the editor, and give it
     split-screen capability.

     I hope to reduce the size as well.  Now that AutoCon is approaching
     its final form, I can start to optimize a lot of the code in it.

     This version of AutoCon is NOT public-domain nor free software,
     but is being distributed as shareware.

     AUTOCON is copyright (c) 1989-92 by Larry Weaver.

     Non-registered users of this software are granted a limited
     license to make an evaluation copy for trial use on a private,
     noncommercial basis, for the express purpose of determining
     whether AutoCon is suitable for their needs.  At the end of this
     trial period, you should either register your copy or discontinue
     using AutoCon.

     What does all this really mean?  If you use this program, then
     you should pay for your copy.  That way I'll be able to provide
     you support and updates, and stay in business.

     An AutoCon registration entitles you to use the program on any
     and all computers available to you.

     All users are granted a limited license to copy AutoCon only for
     the trial use of others and subject to the above limitations.
     This license does NOT include distribution or copying of this
     software package

      (a.) in connection with any other product or service,
      (b.) for general use within a company or institution, or
      (c.) for distribution in modified form, i.e., the file containing
           this license information MUST be included, along with the
           full AutoCon documentation.

     Operators of electronic bulletin board systems (Sysops) are
     encouraged to post AutoCon for downloading by their users, as
     long as the above conditions are met.

     If you are the distributor of a public-domain or user-supported
     software library, you may be eligible to distribute copies of
     AutoCon.  You must meet all the above conditions and acquire
     written permission from Larry Weaver before doing so, however.
     Please telephone or write for details.

     by contacting that member directly, ASP may be able to help.  The
     ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute or problem with an
     ASP member, but he does not provide technical support for
     members' products.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at

                           ORDERING INFORMATION

     An AutoCon registration licenses you to use the product on a
     regular basis.  Users need register only one version of AutoCon;
     registration includes licensed use of all upgrades.  Registered
     users can always get the current version of the program at a
     nominal fee ($8.00 as of this writing) by calling or writing
     Larry Weaver.  Individual registrations for AutoCon cost only
     $15.

     CORPORATE SITE LICENSES AND QUANTITY PURCHASES

     All corporate, business, government, or other commercial users of
     AutoCon must be registered.  A site license is available for a
     one-time charge of $120.00 for the first one hundred (or fewer)
     users/machines fewer) and $100 for each additional one hundred
     (or fewer) users/machines.

     Note: with a site license (if you also purchase the upgrade),
     only one copy of the program will be sent.  You will be
     responsible for distributing additional copies.

     ALL PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
