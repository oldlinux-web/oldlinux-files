Edpart.exe is a disk partition editor capable of managing up to four
partitions on PC/XT and AT hard disks.  It specifically says "no
copyright", so I figured someone else might like to use it rather than
doing fdisk/diskfix pairs to create partitions.

There's no instruction file and no real on-line help, so here's a
summary:

EDPART.EXE maintains up to four hard disk partitions on either of two
hard drives.  If it sees more than one hard drive, it will ask which
one to edit.

The commands are:

CREATE	Create hard disk partitions
DELETE	Delete hard disk partitions
STATUS	Bootable partitions may have the following status:
	ACTIVE		This partition is the boot partition
	READ/WRITE	R/W, not the boot partition
	Non-bootable partitions (``extensions'') may be any of:
	READ/WRITE
	READ-ONLY
	INACCESSIBLE
TYPE	There are four types; for Minix purposes, either "extension"
	type will do to my knowledge.
	DOS(4) Bootable		For DOS 3.x
	DOS(4) Extension
	DOS(1) Bootable		For DOS 2.x
	DOS(1) Extension
	The "Bootable" partitions are recognized by MS-DOS directly,
	so I don't advise using either of them for Minix.
