I have heard of two separate total-compression schemes for Linux: 
'double', which reputedly is dangerous (fill the filesystem and you are 
dead), and and 'brbasec', about which I haven't heard anything.

Subject: Support for ISO9660 CDROMS with 512 byte logical blocks?
Date: 17 Oct 1994 23:53:12 +1000

Does anyone known how to get the Linux file system to work with CDROMs that
have a logical block size of 512 bytes? The ISO filesystem code with the
kernel I have, 1.1.45, dies when the 2048 (or 1024) byte assumption fails.
I have tried to set the block size manually, eg "mount -o block=512 ..." but
`ll_rw_block' chokes with "only 1024-char blocks implemented (2048)."  Could
I just rearrange the code for isofs/inode.c do adopt the CD's logical block
size dumping the test that kills the mount? A two hour compile time and not
being sure how blocks are mapped to buffers stop me from just trying it. Any
advice would be appreciated.

Richter, shut up.

I'm tired of listening to you.  You've been after us about how we do things
for the last 1.5 years or more.  We haven't changed our methods to suit you,
and we never will.  You've insulted us, cajoled us, tried to get people to
leave our team to work with you, and none of it has worked.  Get it through
your thick skull that XFree86 is not Linux, and never will be Linux.  We
do things OUR way, not YOUR way, and, for that matter, not Linus' way.

By our choice.

We've got 75-100 beta testers running Linux.  None of them reported these
problems.

Since I don't run Linux, I can't comment on why the shared libraries were
done this way.

Except to point out that if you folks had SVR4-style shared libraries, you
wouldn't have these problems.

I'll be damned if I'm going to put up with 10-100,000 newbies monkeying
around with software that could damage their hardware, when I know damn
well it isn't ready for them.  Others seem to be able to shed themselves
of that responsibility (yourself included - your R6 servers have bugs/hacks
known to damage hardware; these problems were documented long before you
released them).  We choose to not release software until we can be pretty
damn sure that it's not going to blow up someone's hardware.

You're free to try to displace The XFree86 Project, Inc as the preeminent 
supplier of free X software - if you can.

I routinely run PERL scripts out of my crontab, where SHELL=/bin/sh,
so I doubt this is true.  I think when it execs the program given the
system figures out if it's a machine executable or a script and takes
care of it as usual.

Yes - get bootpc from ftp.linux.org.uk and read the scripts that come with
it. You may need a --bootimage "" option on the bootpc command line.

Damn..we don't get that here. I was wondering if any hardware freaks had
written an 8 LED for parallel port driver. After all I've got three parallel

Subject: Which /bin/[Mm]ail* for Linux ?
Date: 17 Oct 1994 20:42:51 GMT

Hi,

For the first time I have to set up mail on several Linux
machines, and all that I am missing is the equivalent of
/bin/mail on other systems.  AFAIK, I need all of the following

1. Transport agent - I use sendmail 8.6.9.
2. Local delivery agent- I've tried mail.local coming with sendmail
   and procmail;  both seem to work OK.
3. A user frontend !  OK, elm works, and many more, but the standard
   on other systems is /bin/mail, isn't it ?

The Email HOWTO is a bit sparse about this last point, only pointing
to the binary package.  I ended up getting the sources for a 'mail'
from NetBSD-current - they compiled after few patches.

2 questions:

(a) Is there a better version for Linux (I see nothing on sunsite) ?
(b) Is there maybe a version that combines features 2. and 3. from
    above in a single binary ?

Thank you,

Wolfram.

Grrr. That is a bug. Please fix bugs, don't kludge them.

Could you (or somebody who sees the problem) implement the following patch
please? It installs a "kernel stack" file in /proc/*, which shows the
active part of the kernel stack of a process. Dumping that file (with "od
-t x4 /proc/???/kstack") and looking up the addresses in linux/zSystem.map
(or with gdb tools/zImage /proc/kcore, "l *0xaddress") should show where
the process is hanging, which should tell us how to fix the problem.

Warning, the following patch is heavily edited (my kernel is somewhat
nonstandard) and may not apply cleanly.
