so that the whole session will end after fvwm's ended.

Ennyway, in fvwm, you don't have to have all that stuff in your .xinitrc.
in the .fvwmrc file there should be a section "FvwmInit" (or close, grep
for it) that can start the stuff up each time you start a session.

Fvwm can do about ennything any other wm can do & better.

Sorry about this but as much as I detest Solaris, the network speed is A1.
Two identical Sparc 5/65s with Solaris 2.3 will sustain 970 to 980 KB/s
with ftp (a 15MB file - my Gnu addons to make Solaris halfway bearable).
This is over a Uni net with a central Powerhub switching subnet packets
and god knows what sort of router spagetti between the 2 machines.

At home I upgraded my 486-33 to an ASUS 486-66 PCI, the old 486 went into the
mailbox machine (the two are networked). This more than doubled the avg.
throughput over the old 386 in there. I now get about 470KB sustained.
Before it hovered around 170KB. Both machines with 1.1.51.

Hope that helps.

Hope you don't mind my jumping in here, but have you had a look at Waffle?
Waffle comes in both DOS and UNIX flavours (orginally written under Unix).  IT
is one of the most configurable BBS programs around, and has built in UUCP for
mail and news.   What's more is, it's CHEAP!  And yes, it will run under Linux.
 There are several Linux installations at present, and a big move on to create
more.  We are going to set up Waffle under Linux within a month or so
(currently running under DOS).

If you want more information let me know!

Interesting.  It depends, I think, on your distribution.  There is no
automagically mechnism to rename the message files.

The bootmessages aren't there anyway.  But you should be able to
retrieve them not to long after the reboot by issuing the
`dmesg' command.  Or include such a command in your startup files and
let it redirect it's output too the syslog files.

It is a feature of X11 - programs can either share their colormap with the
system and just allocate a few colors for themselves, or they use a private colormap
getting all the colors, but only inside their own window. 

You will see the same when using the visual schnautzer of xv which uses a 
private colormap because of the individual multicolor icons for each gif/jpg...

xfractint -private yields the same result - more colors but ugly behaviour.

Of course, that possible. The only thing you have to do is:

1) log in under linux
2) start the "xinit" program, with a ~/.xinitrc-file 
   (or /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc) , which does some initialisations and 
   starts no window-manager (fvwm), but instead a xterm as last application
   (without "&"!)

  >.......... End of ~/.xinitrc ..........


3) You have to allow X-access for the Sun-Workstations:
   "xhost +"   (enable all hosts on the internet)
  or 
   "xhost leo  pippi.geophys.nat.tu-bs.de"  (enable only hosts "pippi" and "leo")

4) rlogin -l <username_on_workstation> <name_of_workstation>
   
5) Set DISPLAY-Environment-variable of the workstation to your LinuX computer:
   (ksh)  export DISPLAY=prometheus:0.0
   or
   (csh)  setenv DISPLAY prometheus:0.0

6) Start window-manager on the workstation:
   "olwm &"


Now you have full access to the mouse-panels and the programs of the workstation.
Perhaps you have edit the PATH Environment variable so that the workstation is 
able to find X-Programs. You can iconify the first xterm now. Do not destroy or
delete it until you have closed/exited/deleted all X-applications on
the workstation!
After exiting the workstations X-apps, you can exit the window-manager
(menu in the mouse-panels). At last, you can log off the workstation
from the first xterm and then you can exit the LinuX-X by exiting the
first "xterm"

Subject: nfs-mounted dos-partition on indy
Date: 22 Sep 1994 19:18:05 GMT


   hello, folks!

   I have been through all linux- and sgi-relevant newsgroups, but
   didn't found an answer to my problem:

   I exported a dos-partition from a linux-486-pc (slackware 1.0.9,
   Kernel 1.1.18). This is locally mounted with
   '/dev/sdb5 /dos_data  msdos rw,exec,umask=000,conv=auto'.
   Next I nfs-mounted this on a SGI-INDIGO2 running IRIX 5.2 .
   At first everything seems to be fine: the parent directory an all
   of its mounted contents have permissions '-rwxrwxrwx root root'.
   BUT: nobody else than root can write to this device when logged on
   the indigo. Write access is denied with the message: 
   'Cannot create filename - Not privileged'.
   More precisely, it is not possible to create non-zero-length
   files. All FAT-operations like deleting files and 'touch'ing new
   files work well.
   Logging in the linux-system with the same non-root-user-account I
   can do what I want on the dos-device.

   I experimented a lot and read probably all relevant manuals. So I
   think it is basically not possible (for some reason) to do what I
   want to do.

   I'm looking forward to your suggestions,  thanks in advance !

Create the file /etc/HOSTNAME and write your favorite name in it.
Perhaps with "echo name >/etc/HOSTNAME", where name is what you want.

Hello!

I hope this isn't in a FAQ, but may be it should be.

I have a HP LaserJet II connected to my Linux box. If I turn on my 
printer at computer start-up, before the Linux kernel loads, everything 
is fine: lpr prints, ghostscript does its job, etc. However, if I turn on 
my printer when Linux is already running, it doesn't go online. It's as 
if something is being sent to the parallel port that interferes with the 
printer, but if the printer is started before Linux loads, it grabs 
control of the parallel port and works.

Does anybody know what is is? I'm running kernel 1.1.19 with PLIP 
disabled. Thanks,

Max

========

    
        I spoke to Linus about this in Heidelberg, and the solution that
    we came up with was to use dynamic allocation of major numbers.  The only
    tricky part is that you somehow need a way of refreshing the /dev/ entries
    whenever you load the module.

How about a /dev pseudo-filesystem, like /proc?

Preferably, this would be mounted as an inherting 
filesystem on /dev, allowing for the creation of 
symbolic links and the like.

This would also have a nice side effect of letting us have 
consistant device names for SCSI devices as new devices 
are added to the system.

        No, because it would be impossible to change the permissions and
ownership.  It would be some new file in /proc (or perhaps /proc/device) that
would be used to help the system rebuild the entries in /dev.  Perhaps
modutils could be modified to know about what needs to be done?

Err, it is included, it does work for me.  Note that a fixed version was

pixel doubling.  I do however agree that switching resolution is the best
