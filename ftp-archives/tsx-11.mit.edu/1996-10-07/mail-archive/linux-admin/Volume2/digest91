using UCB sendmail you can use the standard macro set to do this quite easily
via MASQURADE_AS("hostname").  check out the sendmail/cf/README and
sendmail/cf/cf/*.mc macro sets for instructions and examples of how it works.
using the m4 macro sets provided with UCB sendmail you can set up a fully
domain-ised system w/ alternate host names and uucp in 6-8 lines and a single
run of m4 (e.g., my own case of a uucp link to the internet using uucp-dom in
taylor uucp-1.05 takes 5 lines total).

Try the UMSDOS filesystem, it should be availible from your normal 
LInux supplier. (I've never got it to work, but I've only tried once)

Another way is to use FIPS which can split your DOS partition into two
parts without erasing the contents of the drive, you just have to run 
defrag first so all dos files are on the beginning of the drive.

I've noticed similar behavior under both 1.0.8 and 1.1.49.  It seems that
route loses the eth0 interface.  I am looking into it in more detail right
now, but don't have any more info.

Hi there,

is there a tool to get a glance at the files opened at the moment :

        - showing the users it's opened by
        - showing the mode it's opened by
        - etc.

I imagine something like the "monitor"-command of novell's netware.

Thanks, and bye.

        I spoke to Linus about this in Heidelberg, and the solution that
we came up with was to use dynamic allocation of major numbers.  The only
tricky part is that you somehow need a way of refreshing the /dev/ entries
whenever you load the module.

        Perhaps a better solution would be for the iBCS2 stuff to have a
preferred major number of 30, and if it cannot get it, then it tries
to dynamicly allocate one.  This way most of the time it will have the
same major.  Even then, some simple script should be used after the module
is loaded to make sure that the /dev entries are correct.

        The iBCS2 emulator can already use dynamicly allocated majors, as
I recall, and the kernel support is already there.  Thus for iBCS2,
the changes would be quite trivial.  I am not sure about the sound driver,
however.

Subject: Bug in Linux 'mv'?
Date: Tue, 20 Sep 1994 12:43:45 GMT

My system is setup with the entire Linux installation on my main hard drive, 
and my /home directory on a separate 40Meg hard drive.

If I move large files from my root disk to the /home disk, the command will
complete, but then the system is locked up (which you don't notice until you
try to execute another command).  This seems to not happen if I use 
'copy -a * /home/wherever;rm *', but that is just plain ridiculous.  After I
reboot, I have to run 'e2fsck' manually on my /home drive, because of an
unexpected inconsistancy.

It happened on another system of mine, which was essentially the same, but a 
different system altogether.  I blamed it then on my second hard drive.  Now 
it happens on this system, so the blame points to at least Linux 'mv'.

Has anybody encountered this?  Any reason's why this would be?  Any fixes
for it out there?  I can't have my system locking up every time someone has
the need to 'mv' a large file across the file system.

I'm using slackware v1.0

Notice that the '331 Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password.' is

I don't think it should say ready.Name either.

I hope this is fixed in slackware 2.0.  I noticed this in the SLS

Date: 22 Sep 1994 13:11:32 GMT

I'm wondering if this is just me or what. I'm currenly running kernel 
v1.1.51, but am still having problems.  When I ran v1.1.50, I couldn't 
get linux to see my second WDC31000 IDE drive.  Now, with v1.1.51, it 
only sees the drive if I boot off a floppy diskette.  This is not 
crucial, but I'd like to figure out if it's just my system, or if others 
have this problem..  

When I boot off of the hard disk, the system does a partition check on 
/dev/hda, and sees that it's a WDC31000 and compensates for the irregular 
drive geometry.  It doesn't even see /dev/hdb.

When I boot off of a floppy, the system performs the partition check on 
both drives, and everything works like a charm.

Is this a timeout (very quick) problem?  I noticed that there were some 
changes to the timeout code in hd.c in patch51.

Any help would be appreciated.

This is so. I used to run an OS/2 based BBS but switched to Linux/Uniboard
to give my users access to the Net. Before I switched I did a mail-out to
see what interest there was. About 30% of my users responded, of those only
about 50% said they would like a Unix shell account. OF the shell accounts
I created only about 50% of those ever bothered to log in.

Switching from the more friendly DOS type BBS's to a Unix one can be very
risky. I haven't had a new user in months, before I switched things were 
ticking over quite nicely.

Many people can't even log in. I've changed the login message so many times
it's not funny, people still can't seem to get the idea of logging in as 'bbs'
before they get to the bbs. Even giving out my home phone number didn't do
the trick.

My favorite is the watching a new user entering their name:

'Fred Nurk, is this your correct name? (Y/N)'

About 5 minutes is the record where the user sat staring at this prompt. 
Perhaps he thought it was a trick question! I had to give him extra time
to log in, took about 15 minutes total.

Getting a good Unix BBS has been the bane of my existence. Uniboard isn't
bad but it still isn't as good as the DOS based ones. Unix doesn't help
either. A BBS needs to know what speed the user connects at to estimate
if they have enough time to finish downloading a file. This requires
knowing the connect string. A standard Unix getty doesn't see this or
pass it onto the BBS. As a result Uniboard will let users download for
hours beyond their time limit.

Be prepared for a lot of hard work if you want to get a good BBS going
under Unix. I'd be very interested to hear about it, and what you did
to overcome the problems.

Maybe not so much tips as warnings. I'm sure it can be done but it requires
a lot more work than I realised or allowed time for. I'll be taking a couple
of weeks leave soon just to stay home and hopefully thrash my system into
shape. Good thing I never had a life, I'd probably miss it :-)

Hey all Linuxers!
I'm experiencing a tiny problem ...
On one hand I'm able by kernel to read from and write to SysV filesytem,
on the other hand I cannot create one :-)
I know that this feature should be used to be compatible and to be able
to read other filesystems. But right at the moment I'd like to create
a SysV filessystem on a floppydisc and cannot find any sources.
So if there are, would you please email me the ftp site address?
Or the sources?
Many thanx in advance

IP addresses must be unique, true -- but unique per host, or per host
interface? The RFCs don't say. I say ;-) that I can't think of any problems
with using the same IP address for multiple interfaces, and in fact it's a
good idea to do so (it avoids wasting network addresses).

Fortunately not, or else we'd still be using BSD 4.2ish networking with
all-zero broadcast addresses.
