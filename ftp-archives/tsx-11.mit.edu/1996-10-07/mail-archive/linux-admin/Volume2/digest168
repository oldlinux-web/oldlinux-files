This really surprises me.....

I pulled down the sendmail + IDA package from tsx-11.mit.edu (forget the
exact name of the file, sorry - can get it if anyone cares) and found
that the lmail binary had trouble writing to the /tmp file.

Looking at the src for lmail.c the code contains the line(s):

if (fputs (line,fp) != strlen (line)) {  ...  }        

in the source.

Doing some detective work yielded that fact that fputs() was always 1 and
never equaled strlen() even though the write was okay.

I changed the line to read:

if (fputs (line,fp) < 0) { ... }
     

and all was okay.  Is fputs() okay?   

Anyway, knowing the problem is 99 percent of the solution and sendmail
is working on linux, delivering to the local users just fine.

Glad you got that working.  Now you can use the tapes you just formatted

Here's a tip: are you using compression with tar?  Trying using tar's
--block-compress option to provide more buffer space between where tar
is and where gzip is compressing.  I use

tar --block-compress -czf /dev/ftape files ...

and it doesn't bomb out anymore like it did before I used that option.

I disagree completely.  This information should be disseminated freely.
I want to know everything about any real or potential security problems
with my computer.  The reasons for this should be obvious.  Linux, in
my opinion, is still an experimenters OS, and as such, I want to know
all the steamy details.

You really shouldn't be expecting any real level of security from a 
freeware UNIX as it is.  Linux is at least as secure as several 
commercial UNIXes, but I would never rely on it for any level of
security.

Subject: PASSWORD LOCK FILE problem - /etc/ptmp
Date: Sun, 9 Oct 1994 16:03:32 GMT


First, I am running slackware 2.0
I am having problems with my password lock file.  Lately for some reason,
users on my linux system are not able to change their passwords or shells.

When issuing the 'passwd' command, and after entering the old pword and
new pword, the change fails.  The error message is "Can't open /etc/ptmp,
can't update password".

The other problem is when using 'chsh' to change shells.  As above the
simple procedure fails with "Can't open /etc/ptmp, can't change shells".

I have consulted the various sysadm manuals specific to linux, but havent
seen mention of this file.  From a general UNIX sysadm book, I got that
if all goes well during the file system check (at boottime),rc checks
the existance and size of the password lock file /etc/ptmp.    It also 
says that this file is created by the "vipw" command.

Well, on my system there is no "vipw" command, and the file /etc/ptmp
simple ISNT THERE.  Leading me to beleive that I accidentally deleted it
somehow.  As root, I have tried to created a file "/etc/ptmp" with a 
blank body, but that doesnt work either.  Then I get "/etc/ptmp exists,
can't change password".  It seems I can't win.  As root I am able to 
sucessfully change other users passwords and shells, but I wish to restore
the ability to them.

I guess what I need, is some advice on how to create an /etc/ptmp file,
or some other way to fix this problem.  Thanks much.  Send replies to
mastaler@netcom.com

Well, it was bound to happen sooner or later. What a goof! 

I was moving a 200M drive over to a 1Gig drive and blasted the darn thing 
with a mkswap instead of a mke2fs (fumble brain). Nonetheless, the 
partition is still there, I've not done anything to it. 

Question is... is it recoverable at all... or not. No big deal either way 
since I can rebuild it, just want to know if I can get it back and how.

Don't let your BIOS' limitation of 504M limit the use of your drive in
linux! If it is a WD 540, then you actually have 1048 cylinders, not
1024, so you are losing 24M of space that linux _can_ use. If you use
LILO, use "hd=1048,16,63" for one of the kernel options, then linux's
fdisk will recognize the true size of the disk and let you make a 
partition past the BIOS "boundary". I think you can use the same syntax
with loadlin (gotta love it!), but when I set up mine, I only had to use
the parameter when setting it up. (booted from floppy, used fdisk...)
Linux recognizes the size of the disk after that. (when booting from the
hd) This is all using 1.0.9! (I heard 1.1.50+ is even better)

Not quite sure what you mean here. I have the full Slackware installed
with a ~24M /, 200M /usr, and 128M /home with plenty of room to spare.
I think games should be either in /usr/games or in a home directory.

P.P.S. Check your drive specs, I have yet to hear of a true 504M drive...

I disagree a bunch of yours also.  However I do agree with a bunch.  If 
people are buying scsi equipment, it's going to be more expensive, very 
true.  However, if you are buying scsi, please buy a real controller.  I 
use the 1542 as an example, because it's what I bought, but there are 
other "good" ones out ther.

Yep, but if you are doing scsi, you should be buying a real controller.  
But you have a good point.  But at the same time, you have to realize 
that the 53c80 driver isn't really a good driver on linux.  It busy waits 
for drive xfers, basically a big "for" loop getting data.  If I remember 
right the 53c80 driver wasn't supposed to be a "real" driver, just 
something to work.

Scsi costs more.  And will continue to do so for awhile.  At the 1gig

Yep, read above.  My 1542 w/o software was around $180 USD, and the 
lowest I've seen them is around $169 USD.  I'm not sure, but most of the 
others are in this price range.

Master/Slave mean anything to you?  Actually SCSI is the defacto standard 
for most Workstation equipment.  If you are talking about PC's and low 
end DOS machines, IDE has sold more.  IDE is cheaper, and people will buy 
it.  SCSI is as standard as IDE is.  SCSI, SCSI-2, Fast, Wide, SCSI-3, 
and then Differential vs. Single (The only problem).  IDE, WD Enhanced IDE, 
Seagate EIDE, etc...  People have posted enough descriptions of what each 
SCSI is.  IDE may be "more common", but standardized, no.

Did you really write this?  It doesn't vibe with the rest of your 
reasons...  IDE's drives are getting better, yes.

:  o Setting up a >528M IDE drive is still much less complicated than SCSI.
Umm?  Say what?  They each are about the same thing, plug in, turn on, 
make sure the controller supports them, partition.

Don't know about these, but they are getting popular like you say.

If you are looking for cheap good solutions, go for IDE.  For most single 
user applications, this works, and works good.  If you are looking at 
multi user applications, and have the money, go for scsi.

Me too. I have spent a whole night recompile most of things.

Just a small comment: you turn echo off with E0 but this has no effect on the 
display of CONNECT and other status messages. Q1 on the other hand turns off 
those messages (result codes). So it is entirely possible that your system 
would work with an ATE0Q0 for both dial-in and dial-out.

This is not meant as a suggestion on how to set up your Linux system (someone

Reply-To: ketil@ii.uib.no


There appears to be a serious bug in some of the networking code
supplied with linux/slackware, that causes the computer to get
'network unreachable' after approximately 3 minutes of perfect
functioning.  I have no idea what the problem might be, and if
somebody tell me where to look, I can try to figure out what versions
my drivers etc. are.  Here are the configurations I ve gotten this
problem with:

AMD DX2/66, 8Mb, VLB CL5428 1Mb with either
* Etherlink II, kernel 1.1.50 and 1.1.49
* SMC Ultra Combo, kernel 1.1.33, 1.1.49, 1.1.50
        -tried both coax and TP
* SMC Ultra something else, also with various kernels

AMD 386/40, 12Mb,
* SMC Ultra Combo, kernel 1.1.33

The 386 works perfectly well with the network with both cards when
using older software (Some old SLS distrib. I believe)

I would very much like to know what is wrong, and how to fix it.

There is also a 'bug' in df, causing a float exception when it cannot
access a non-existent NFS-mount.

Thanks for any help,

DON'T THROW AWAY 2.1.1 JUST TO GET A 3.1 X SERVER!!!!

All you need to do is get the server itself, set up the new-style XF86config,
make a few symlinks, and that's it.  You can run all your 2.1.1 stuff with the
new Xserver w/no problem.  (I'm using the W32 server with 2.1.1, and it works
just fine.)

If anyone needs help on how to do this, I'll be glad to assist.  Getting the
entire XFree86 3.1 package is a bit of overkill if you just want an updated
Xserver.  I'm gonna get the new 320x200 server today and symlink it, too.  It
should work as well, if that's what you're looking for (and I know a BUNCH of 
people who would only want 3.1 because of the new 320x200 mode...I wonder why
...).
