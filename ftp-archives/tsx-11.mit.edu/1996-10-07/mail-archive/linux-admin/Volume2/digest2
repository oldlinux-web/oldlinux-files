I guess you have an old psdatabase or the Symbol table doesn't correspond
to the current kernel.
Try to run Xps -U first to create a new psdatabase. If this doesn't work
make sure the unstripped kernel image is the same as the kernel image
used for booting. The unstripped kernel image will be normaly found in
/usr/src/linux/tools/zSystem. The easiest way to create a new one is
to recompile the kernel.

Hope this will work
Greetings Thomas

Some FTPD has extra flavour to enable you to tar the directory first and 
then send the whole directory as a tar'ed file. To do this you need just put
an .tar at the end of the directory name. You can also copy files compressed
by appending .Z, or .gz, etc. to the file names.

I think src.doc.ic.ac.uk support this. 

Hope this is of help.

Subject: Linux hangs up and no trace why
Date: 30 Aug 1994 15:16:09 GMT

Hi,

We have a 486 DX2/66 machine with the following devices and settings
(Slackware 2.0):

Adaptec AHA1542CF
        I/O=330
        IRQ=12
        DMA=5
        SCSI ID=7

Quantum LP120S
        SCSI ID=0

Quantum LPS540S
        SCSI ID=1

Sony CD-ROM CDU-561
        SCSI ID=6

SMC 8216 Ultra
        I/O=280
        IRQ=15
        RAM=C800

Trident TVGA8900D


Everything works: we can read-write any partition, we can mount the CD-ROM
or play an audio CD and the network is running.

But sometimes the system hangs up, especially when NOBODY uses the system.
Then we can type in commands and hit Enter, but nothing executed. We can 
switch between the virtual consoles, that's all.

We changed the motherboard, the Adaptec card, the disk, the SCSI cable but
nothing helped.

There is only one "clue", but it doesn't help us: we get this "failed"
message at every boot:

Aug 30 12:23:51 cern kernel: Calibrating delay loop.. ok - 33.22 BogoMips
Aug 30 12:23:51 cern kernel: failed

Has anybody ever encountered such a problem?

Thanks ANY help or hint,

Subject: HELP! Intermittent connect & ARPing probs
Date: 30 Aug 1994 12:07:16 -0600

My Linux box is going seriously weird.  The machine is refusing all 
inbound network connections for periods of up to five hours or more.  
Sometimes it works fine.  Other times it will boot a user off for no 
apparent reason.  The system is constantly responding to pings but 
refusing connections to all ports.  The syslog files are filled with 
lines such as:

Aug 29 22:34:47 trident kernel: <6>ARP: ARPing my own IP address 
35.8.156.105 !

The system remains running locally.  I am pretty sure it is running 
kernel version 1.1.0.  The system runs on a 386SX/16 with 4 megs of RAM 
and about 12 megs swap.  The distribution was originally Slackware 
1.1.1 (and still is pretty much the same).  The system also runs an 
NE2000 network card.  

These problems just started happening a few days ago.  We made no changes 
to the system since that time or before that time.  It seemed as though 
it just happened.

Can somebody tell me how to rectify this problem?  If not, please tell me 
what causes the system to "ARP" its IP address.  Also, if you believe 
this problem lies outside of the system (a network problem) let me hear 
some of your reasoning [although I doubt this since it responds to pings 
when it refuses connections].  Any help would be greatly appreciated as 
my net access is far more limited without this machine.

That's right. You could store up to 525MB on a DC6525. As i uses a QIC-Streamer
whith 6250 or 6525 too, i tested this some days (month) ago.

But: If you think, that you back up 200 (or so) Megs to tape, because
you use 'df' before backing up, this is not right.

Within my system i'm back up 23Megs more for the /proc/kore-file, wich isn't
shown in the df-command.

You could test ist, if you use the dd-command (and you got/have the time
to try it).

I have wondered about if that is something that should be fixed in
Linux... I have had thoughts about a SIGNUKE signal that would have
the same effects as a SIGKILL (untrappable, terminate execution) but
which would also immediately wake up the process so it could receive
it.

I rejected another idea, having a generic wakeup_and_send_signal
syscall, since if the process trapped the signal it might get confused
about the non-standard behaviour.

I'm no expert, but I believe this is an inherent property of unix -- a
process in a wait state waiting on an I/O request can not be killed by
any means.

A bad disk sounds like a much more serious concern to me:-)

This works fine on my linux box running BIND-4.8.3-BETA9. The linux box
is running 1.1.38. I remembered that the older bind did some times died
mysteriously after running for a while though not sure whether this is
related to what you experience.

This one works fine for about a month so far.

..  I really don't understand how they could have done this.  
Someone mentioned that since ntalkd speaks UDP, they could have 
used that protocol to (somehow!) cause a reboot ...

I'd appreciate any insight you might have.  At this point, i've 
disabled the talk daemon completely out of fear of another reboot.

Thanks.

First thing is first.
        To change the ami bios setup this means that you have to have access
        to dos.  I used to run a linux box w/ 80+ users and after we installed
        linux and put a password on the ami-bios.  There was no possible way
        to boot from a, short of taking the cover off the computer ...

After you have installed linux and put a password on the ami-bios, how
can anyone boot dos without the password and taking the cover off?

Subject: **** HOW TO FIX YOUR CDROM!! ****
Date: Mon, 29 Aug 1994 14:54:18 GMT

    
        I've finally found out why most of us have CDROM's that work on 
installation, but don't work when running Linux regularily. The problem 
is that the wrong driver is being used. You have to use 
the "standard" driver rather than the "enhanced" driver. This may not work 
for all of you, but it worked for me.

        1) If you look in /root/linux/drivers/block (this may be in 
another directory for you), you'll see "cdu31a.c", "cdu31a.c-enhanced", 
and "cdu31a.c-standard." I suspect that those of you not using the CDU31A 
drivers will see something similiar for whatever CDROM you're using. If 
you type "ls-l cdu31a.c", you'll see that "cdu31a.c" is linked to 
"cdu31a.c-enhanced." If it's linked to "cdu31a.c-standard" then forget 
about this fix -- you have another problem. Move "cdu31a.c" to 
cdu31a.c-backup (just in case), and then copy "cdu31a.c-standard" to 
"cdu31a.c" Instead of copying, you could just change the link, but I 
forget the exact syntax of the command. Basically, all you have to do is 
make "cdu31a.c-standard" the CDROM driver, which is called "cdu31a.c".

        2) Now you have to recompile the kernel. Do whatever you need to 
do on your system to recompile the kernel, and don't forget to tell Lilo 
what you did. I just did a "make clean", then "make dep", then "make 
zImage" and copied it to "/" by hand (backup up the old kernel, of 
course.) Then I used "liloconfig" to reinstall Linux, and then rebooted. 
I skimped on this description, so do whatever need to be done on YOUR 
system to recompile the kernel. I'm sure I broke several rules on 
recompiling kernels, but I don't care (nya, nya.)

        3) Upon rebooting, I found that I still had the error appearing 
on the startup screens. I did a manual mount "mount -t iso9660 -r 
/dev/cdu31a /cdrom" and it worked fine. Yahoo! I then took the line about 
the CDROM out of /etc/fstab, and put a line in /etc/rc.d/rc.local to 
mount the CDROM, "mount -t iso9660 -r /dev/cdu31a /cdrom". This issues the 
mount command when you boot-up. You'll have to "umount" and "mount" the 
CDROM whenever you change CD's -- I believe this is normal. 

        4) Party! Rejoice! This annoying problem is gone!

        This proves that if you really want to get anything accomplished, 
you have to wait until 3:00 am until you're truly inspired.

        Let me know how this turns out for you!
