Well, I read the replys re: reading the bash man page - and I'll reply
anyway :-)  Finding the files bash uses is indeed easy from the man
page because they are near the end "G" in less followed by a few
"b"'s and boom you're there.  But the Bash man page (I've only read it
a dozen times so far - not nearly enough to understand it!) is
decidedly bad for finding out little things.  Like for example, bash
will never source .bashrc if it is invoked as "sh" (via symbolic links
like on my system).  So .bashrc is only used if you type "bash" from
within another shell.  Maybe this is your problem?

 Copy the ls program to ftp/bin, then run chmod 555 ftp/bin/ls


 I don't know why but I could also use a ls without the program in ftp/bin.

Also you need to copy ld.so and libc.so.??? in ftp/lib.

 I don't see how you could continue running linux without an emulator. If you
have also an idea on how to run DOS in a window or in a linux session, let us
know, a lot of people would be interested in this news group. 

 Maybe a multi processor PC could handle this but there is a big work to make
on it...

During boot, at the LILO prompt, you type 'linux S'. If you don't have a 
prompt when the word 'LILO' is displayed, hit the Shift key. If your lilo is 
configured differently (i.e., linux is not called 'linux' but something else) 
use that word.

Summary:

Hello,

I could really use some help on the following:

1)  Does Linux support the Pentium?
2)  Does Linux support 32 | 64 bit Video (PCI)?
3)  Would an SCSI HD make life better?
4)  How does one get Linux + a GUI (X Windows / Motiff) + a C++ compiler
    and other utils?
5)  Are there any major brand hardware peices I need to watch out for?
6)  Or, is there a list (are there lists) of Linux / Xfree86 / C++ 
    compatibility and availability w/respect to Pentium / PCI Video. 
    I'd LOVE to know.

I really need to buy a machine and get Unix (Linux) running ASAP.  I do 
some DOS programming so I'd like to go with the Pentium and whatnot, but
perhaps not...  From what I've gathered, I need to watch what I buy if I
go with Linux.

Help would be very greatly appreciated.  My other option is to just buy
the SCO Unix (spelled $$$).  I'd like to avoid that.

Thanks,

DT

I think there is another reason of why the  dir and ls don't work. Maybe
that is due to file protection of the directory of the "ftp home dir". I
have experienced  that after  changing  the  protection  to u+rwx  only,

Stick with INN, in the long haul it's worth it.  I'm still a bit new to

The Mac emulator "Executor" creates two files for each fork when reading/
writing to a non-HFS filesystem, namely filename and %filename. I think
I would go for either the % form or an extension e.g. .rsrc.

I prefer this idea of having separate files in the same directory though
because the user has immediate access to each fork without having to look at 
different directories. Resources become just another file type and there's 
no impact on the file system. At most, "ls" might have to be tinkered with.

Someone is already porting CAP to Linux; I asked about this a while
back and got a response from one of the people doing it. If you'd
like I can dig up the email...

Subject: [Q] How to create and admin Linux LAN
Date: 7 Sep 1994 15:14:03 GMT


I'am looking for some Linux admins which have experiences in installing
and managing a small (private) local network.

This is my equipment:
i486/33 20Mb, i386/25 4Mb, 2 HD (340Mb, 120Mb), 5 1/4 + 3 1/2'' floppies,
2 multisync Monitors, 2 VGA cards, 2 seriell cards, 2 mices, 2 keyboards,
a printer.
I will buy 2 Ethernet cards etc.

These are my goals: Running the i486 as an NFS server and let the
other one boot diskless via NFS (if possible, otherwise boot the kernel
by diskette). Having two X Terminals with WINE emulator running
MS-Windows (argh..). One of the two should work as a spooler/print
server.

Now my questions: Is this possible? Has anyone done this? What do I have
to buy additionaly? What should I buy? And:
        WHERE can I find DOCUMENTATION for that?

I'am happy about any help!

Send email!
Thanx for all, Joerg

What a button does in a particular window is under the control of the
program that owns that window.  So to change the button that does "paste" in
an xterm window involves fiddling with xterm resources, etc.

That probably wasn't what you wanted to hear, but I hope it helps anyway.
