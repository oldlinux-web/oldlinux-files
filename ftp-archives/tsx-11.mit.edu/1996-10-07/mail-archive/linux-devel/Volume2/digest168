This is great news.  But I've heard it many times before.  Remember
my "acid test"?  Can I quote Shakespeare and the Quran in the same
paragraph, and have everything wrap and space correctly?  There are
established typographical conventions for multilingual and multidi-
rectional text.  I've heard of several TeX "versions" hacked to sup-
port one or another script or language.  But I've never heard of a
genuinely multilingual TeX.  Is there one?

Frustration is typically what I feel when talking to people about in-
ternationalized/multilingual documents.  For example there's been a
lot of hoopla over multilingual Emacs extensions - which turn out to
be hacks for Japanese mainle.  And there's a supposedly "multilingual"
Mosaic - which turns out to handle just a few European languages.
There has even been talk about how the Linux kernel does not rely on
national scripts, and is thus multilingual, but a quick grep of the
source tree reveals many expressions that rely on a stable mapping of
specific alphabetic symbols like 'a' to a single underlying code.

One of our list readers did send me some of the specs on Mime, and lo
and behold this does seem - really - to be a multilingual standard.
It even has explicit discussion of multidirectional documents that mix
scripts from languages with "incompatible" directions (at least left-
right and right-left; the conventions for embedding left-right in
up-down text require that you turn things sideways :-)).

Well, you only have to do this once, if you're smart---you do it as a
separate file.  In the case of ISO8859-1 and linux, I guess that file
is 'vmlinuz'---or, I guess, your video card ROM.  (If I got that
wrong, don't waste your breath flaming, just substitute the correct
charset and font location.)

I should say Chinese, Japanese, and Korean count as 'non-European',
and any X11R[456] mirror has those in BFD format.  (Japanese and
Korean for sure, and I believe this is true of Chinese as well for R5
and R6.)  I believe there are also Arabic fonts available in the same
places, but I'm not sure.  I seem to recall that the Hershey fonts
include several non-European fonts, but they certainly don't include
anything like a functional set of kanji for Japanese.  I believe that
X and maybe Ghostscript include Type-1-izing programs for bitmap
fonts, as well.

Including Chinese and Japanese.  But I don't know if Don Knuth thought
about multidirectional languages.

One place where people have done a *lot* of thinking about
multilingual programming and localization is the MULE project, the
MUlti-Lingual Emacs.  I don't use the multi-lingual aspects, but they
are apparently pretty sophisticated.  Also, there are multi-locale
extensions for Mosaic; as of 6 months ago they didn't support multiple
languages in the same browser window, though.  For both of these, you
can point your WWW browser at www.ntt.ac.jp (love them phone company
labs!) and Mosaic info of course can be found at www.ncsa.uiuc.ecu.

Yes, it's necessary.  No, it's nowhere near sufficient.  There are
wrong ways of doing it.  For example, in the original NEmacs (Japanese
emacs) the code which handled 1-byte charsets (ie, interpolated
English as far as I was concerned; there are other 1-byte charsets
used in Japanese but I don't use them) for some reason insisted on
making quotation marks into a word (so that "this" could wrap between
the 's' and the '"') in a way that could *not* be properly fixed by
the usual GNU emacs wordbreaking facilities.  Instead a separate test
had to be added in the wordwrapping function, a place that non-USS
Enterprise crewmembers should never have to seek out.  Furthermore,
this was *not* robust across 2-byte charsets (for historical and
Microsoft---why do they screw up everything they touch?---reasons
there are no less than three 2-byte charsets for the ideographic kanji
in common use on general purpose computers, and yet others on the
dedicated wordprocessors).  Furthermore, on at least one occasion (the
file got lost in a flurry of editing, and I haven't been able to
reproduce it) my fix broke the interpretation of 2-byte sequences.
    I have not checked this, but I was told that MULE, the updated
MUlti-Lingual Emacs, uses a state flag to determine whether there is a
one-byte charset in use, and this problem should not occur.

I haven't read the dosemu0.53 docs, but the previous ones basically
say 1.1.something+, or 1.0.soemthing with some patch.  They all also
say "your mileage may vary" or equivalent disclaimer, since it is
alpha software still.
    Grepping for 'kernel' and 'compat' gave nothing useful, although I
may not have all the docs.
    Presumably he wants to know which kernels seem to break dosemu---I
have seen such posts on this group.  Maybe completely unwarranted, but
I've seen them.  (I don't know or care whether they were true bugs or
not, since I'm using 1.1.18 + dosemu 0.52 and nothing's broke yet, nor
do I yet need any capabilities that pair doesn't have.)
    'Twould be 'nice' (I should volunteer, but I'm not even keeping up
with my other volunteer projects) if there were a 'kernel-incompatibility'
file to go with the 'EMU-success' file, just to record people's
complaints.  (Compiler wouldn't bother to verify them, just archive
them for others to check out.)

This is one of the goals of Linux International, a nonprofit organization 
which is currently forming. A number of Linux developers, such as Michael 
Johnson, Alan Cox, and Ian Murdock are working with Linux International in 
order to promote the development and growth of Linux. One of LI's goals is 
to lobby commercial software developers to release products for Linux.

This is not LI's only goal, of course. Another focus is to support the
Linux developers themselves, by helping to direct donations and funding.
My concept has been to form a "grant fund" where people can send donations
to support Linux development. People who wish to develop software for
Linux (such as new device drivers, applications, and so forth) and require
funding (to purchase equipment, documentation, etc.) can make a 
grant request. Grants will be awarded out of the pool of donations sent
to this fund.

This seems to be the only way to manage donations for Linux development.
With all due respect, it doesn't make a great dceal of sense to send
your money just to Linus Torvalds or Patrick Volkerding. Scores of
others have spent as much time working on Linux over the last two
years. You could always support the FSF, which does, in fact, support Linux. 
But what about people developing the Linux kernel? And the many others not 
affiliated directly with the FSF? Because the Linux "development team" is so 
disorganized, a grant fund seems to be the best way to go.

There's no organization behind Linux. LI is not an attempt to form one.
It is just an attempt to promote the growth of Linux through aiding
developers. 

LI is still in the planning stage, but watch c.o.l.* and Linux Journal
for more details.

[Jumping in on the -fPIC discussion :)]

I'm trying to port a few dynamic libraries from a sparc to Linux. 
Everything have been working OK until now, when I realize that I can't
have mutually dependent libraries (that is, a routine in lib X calls
a routine in lib Y, and vice versa).
I've tried a few things, but no matter what I end up with symbols
undefined in one of the libraries.
It seems that a DLL have to be self-contained. I know the obvious answer
to this question - rearrange the libraries - but since that is a little
bit of too much work, I would like to know if there's another way out.

PIC works OK both under SunOS and Solaris 2. I'm using tools-2.16 and
gcc 2.5.8.

(1) The ftape that comes with Slackware 2.0
does not work with my Colorado Jumbo
(the first drive mentioned in the documentation).

The drive works perfectly under MSDOS.

Did anyone get ftape to work "out of the box"
with this version of Slackware?

My impression is that it does not work.
In that case it surely should not be distributed?

(2) Although the latest version of ftape from sunsite
compiled without problem,
insmod threw up half-a-dozen linking errors.

Is one meant to apply a patch?
If so, why is that not stated anywhere in the distribution?

(3) Am I alone in finding this software (ftape) causes undue suffering?

I have a 250 MB dos partition (formattet with MSDOS 5), and when mounting 
this partition under linux, I'm not able to read a file using the last

There is not any problems reading the same file when booting plain dos..

The error has been in the kernel since 1.1.29, and may be in older versions.

True. Therefore, the problem is not in the kernel but in whichever program
uses seconds for minuteswest in the settimeofday() system call. See "man
