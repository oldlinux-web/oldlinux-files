I also have the shadow-mk package and have seen the _login and login.secure files in my directories. What's wrong with them???????, exept for the fact that no sources are available of login.secure. Ask the author for the sources and check them for any pittfalls. Don't we trust each other anymore?????

Is there anyone who's an expert on the resolver in Linux who I
can discuss my problem with ?

I'm using an external DNS, and when Linux makes a query it insists
on adding the default domain to any hostname that doesn't have a
trailing dot.
So, for example, if I ping "bmdhh130.bnr.co.uk" from g8fsl.ampr.org,
Linux puts out a DNS request for "bmdhh130.bnr.co.uk.ampr.org", which
doesn't get resolved and I get a "host not known" error.

Any help would be appreciated - I've tried looking through the source
code but it isn't commented well enough for me to debug by
code-reading.

Depends on your definition of intelligent.  There is a Linux driver for
the Cyclades board based on Cirrus Logic RISC chips.  These chips are like
really smart buffered UARTS rather than a general-purpose processor on the
board but it's fast and it works.

If you need more info, there is an article on the driver development in
the September issue of Linux Journal.

If Mohan is the cracker you suggest, what he would hate the most
would be publishing the login.secure program.

If Mohan is innocent, the fastest way to clear his neame would be
to publish the login.secure program.

Either way, I suggest you uuencode login.secure (if it's not an

The Hurd is more complete than you think and ``Linux on Mach'' too. In
fact, a major part of the ``Linux on Mach'' project is now usable: the
ext2fs server (the other major part being binary compatibility). BTW,
the Hurd is very well designed and I think it was worth the wait. I
like Linux better than the Hurd but I think that using Hurd technology
to acheive ``Linux on Mach'' is the best possible solution now.

BTW, most problems with Mach are very likely to be solved in Mach
4. Bryan Ford, the head developper for Mach 4, is much more open to
requests from the ``freeware world'' than CMU ever was.

The 3c503 init routines probes for your net adapter first at i/o address
0x2e0 (which is not successful), the at address 0x310 (where it actually
resides). Hence the adapter is this time detected, and the routine grabs
its RAM address range, which spans from 0xdc000 to 0xddfff.

Date: 5 Sep 1994 12:59:17 -0400


        HORRIBLE SWAP THRASHING BUG (please try this)

A simple program that runs consistantly in ~1.25min on my 
SGI 33Mhz r3k Indigo completely ruins my Linux box.
Please run the short program "thrash" (see end) and let me know
how it performs on your system...for me this is a 
serious problem.

Will adding more memory make the situation better? How much more?
Will another Linux release behave better?

Thanks.

Russ

Configuration:
        Linux 1.1.48
        P90 PCI
        16M ram
        >80Mbytes swap (1 18M partition, 4 16M files)

Symptoms:
        1. run "thrash" once (~4min)...everything is okay
        2. run "thrash" again (~1 hour!) ... system is very sluggish
        3. run "thrash" again (> ~1 hour!) ... nothing runs, locked

Directions:
        0. Compile "thrash"
                gcc -O2 -m486 thrash.c -o thrash

        1. Make a big file (~100Mbytes) :
                dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1024 count=100000

        2. run "thrash"
                time thrash bigfile

        3. run "thrash"
                time thrash bigfile

        4. run "thrash"
                time thrash bigfile

I had a similar problem with the DEPCA driver in some 1.1.1x or 2x
version of the kernel, now it's fixed, but what I did that time was to
hard code the IRQ value in the Space.c file in ~linux/drivers/net.

Subject: BUG Report for SCSI developers 1.1.49

Ok, I upgraded from Slack 1.0? to Slack 2.0 this weekend
I have updated the system from downloads and kept it as new as i could
but at the weekend i reinstalled ALL from 2.0
I was running 1.1.49 gcc2.5.8 + libs ....24  with slack 2.0 im now
libs ....26 etc.. the rest is much the same.
I have 386/387 adaptec 1542B scsi devices
Syquest 88mb Nec cdr841 Phillips scsi-1 cdrom  so 1x scsi-2 disk
1x scsi-1 cdrom 1x scsi-2 cdrom
1.0.9 has no problems with mounting or unmounting scsi-1 or -2
devices,  However on my old config pre slack 2.0 i did have some
intermittant scsi timeouts.
with the new config slack 2.00 + kernel 1.1.49 compiled with
scsi disk scsi cdrom  without scsi tape and without scsi generic
with scsi driver 1542 support.
in the system is 2 ide disks + qic02 tape ms-busmouse wd-8013
all on defaults addr + irqs except busmouse = irq9
on bootup of 1.1.49 i sometimes get a scsi host (0) detected
and then system hangs up,  after waiting for 1-2 mins to see what happens
i get scsi timeouts as per the uue listing below
also if the system boots up. and i try to mount ANY scsi device
i get continious logging as per the uue file below

I would ask the scsi developers to look!! at this bug report
Thanks Barry..

I had this problem with an IDE drive - every 16 bytes transferred from the
drive would have bit 0 stuck - even after a cold reboot and loading DOS 
instead of Linux.  Interestingly, even the drive ID was corrupted to something 
like 'Samsung Elecuronics SHC-' something.  I was just using Linux when the
problem became apparent...ie, I got several kernel panics.  This was quite a
while ago, and appeared to be solved by removing and reinserting the data 
cable to the drive, so it may well have been the drive itself - it just 
seemed too much of a cooincidence.  ISTR it was with a kernel pre 1.1.22.

Has anyone had a problem with this file giving
'Unexpected Eof' message when unzipped/untarred ??

taar zxf gnat-1.81-l1-bin.tar.gz

Yes, I did use bin and then pulled it again to make sure
