GNU Pascal 2.5.8 can be found on sunsite.unc.edu... it is standard (not Turbo)
pascal, though, but give it a try.

It seems to work for me, though it produces *HUGE* executables (up to about 4

Is it possible to stop the harddiskmotor when it isn't used a long time?
I'd like the possibility of something like that in the kernel.
I'd like to know if somebody is developing such an addition to the kernel.

I have a Gateway 2000 4DX2 66V with a mitsumi cd

kernel 1.1.45 it will not mount. It gives the error on 
boot;
/dev/mitsumi_cd is not a valid block device.
and if I try to mount it manually it gives the error;
/dev/mitsumi_cd no such device or address.
All is OK if I go back to Kernel 1.1.0.

Subject: aha152x driver lockup on AIC 6360 chips
Date: 22 Sep 94 12:40:20 GMT

I have a problem with my SCSI driver.  My machine runs either
Linux-1.0.9 or 1.1.50 with the aha152x SCSI driver.  I think the
problem occurs with both versions of Linux.  I was backing up files
(see below) when the errors occurred.  I can't be sure of the
version of Linux that was running when this error occurred because
I don't know which version was running at the time.  Here's the
error message:

waiting: SCSISEQ( ); SCSISIG( DATA OUT ); INSTAT( hi ); SSTAT( BUSFREE );
        SSTAT( BUSFREE ); SXFRCTL0( CH1 ); SIGNAL( ); SELID( 81);

current_SC:

disconnected_SC:

Later, pretty much the same information was displayed, with the only
difference being

scsidisk I/O error: dev 0812, sector 200

I know that 1.1.50 was running when this error occurred:

scsi0: resetting for second half of retries

It was displayed on the console, but no other information appeared
on the console when this error occurred.

Both errors occurred while accessing the same file (a *.wav file).
Each backup session had been running for 20-30 minutes and they still
stopped in the same file on consecutive runs.

The files being backed up were on /dev/sda3, the third and last
partition on the first Micropolis (see below) SCSI drive.  This drive
has three partions on it.  From fdisk:

partition       begins  ends    blocks  type

sda1            1       60      61424   DOS 16-bit >= 32M
sda2            61      90      30720   Linux swap
sda3            91      1280    1218560 Linux native
        part. 3 has 3 different physical/logical endings
        physical = (255, 63, 32) logical = (1279, 63, 32)

My machine is a Zeos Pantera-90 (Pentium, 90 MHz) with an integrated
Adaptec AIC-6360 SCSI controller chip (BIOS version 1.20L), a Diamond
SpeedStar 64 Alpine PCI video adapter board, a SoundBlaster 16 MCD
sound card, and a SMC8013E Ethernet card.  On the SCSI bus are two
Micropolis 1.2GByte disk drives and one NEC CD-510 CD-ROM drive.  The
Micropolis drives have 64 heads, 32 sectors, 1280 cylinders, with
1MByte/cyl.

I was backing up my files by running a pipe of tar and gzip into a
remote shell (rsh) to a Sun on the same Ethernet network.  On the
Sun I run 'dd' to put the bitstream onto a cartridge tape.

This same method of backing up files has worked for a year or more on
a Dell 450/ME with a AHA1742 and a SMC8013E, running various versions
of Linux, the last being 1.0.9 and 1.1.42.  This problem never
occurred on the Dell.  It also had an SMC8013E, but no sound card.

Maybe I should go try the aha1542 I have lying around?

You can (more or less) easily achieve this with symbolic links.
These also is an experimental filesystem (IFS) which can do it automatically.

I am trying to get a task to transform into another program
using the "execl" function call. The task appears to die
with the following displayed on the screen:

        libc.so.4 (DLL Jump 4.5pl26) => /lib/libc.so.4.5.26

Can anyone tell me what this means, what I'm doing wrong, and/or
how to fix it?

A trace line just before the "execl" prints but I don't get tracing
from after the "execl" or from the beginning of the target program.

I am running Slackware Pro 2.0 / Linux version 1.1.18.

IP addresses must be unique, true -- but unique per host, or per host
interface? The RFCs don't say. I say ;-) that I can't think of any problems
with using the same IP address for multiple interfaces, and in fact it's a
good idea to do so (it avoids wasting network addresses).

Fortunately not, or else we'd still be using BSD 4.2ish networking with
all-zero broadcast addresses.

Much as I hate to, I feel I have to disagree with you there.  It depends how
much RAM you have - if you have enough to provide a reasonable size cache and
prevent demand paged binaries from becoming non-resident then it is a
different ball game. It is probably best to have some of the distribution on
the faster hard drive, agreed, but you were being a bit slating about the
concept.  It is workable.

Surely not, if the "text" segment of the library is widely separated
from the "data" segment, and the pages of the data segment are marked
as COW ?

Once a refcount in the kernel drops to zero, the thing is marked to be
flushed, but put on the end of the free list in case it gets re-used.

...heck, it's starting to sound like the Amiga's shared library scheme,
but because you're using VM, you don't need to use the PC-relative
addressing (a win for x86-en) which was a requirement for the Ami's
MMU-less 68000).

Instead, you use absolute(?) VM addresses for intra-library calls,
patched up upon loading.

Hey ! Your new shared library is a Virtual ROM at a "fixed" address !

        - or is this too crazy ?

Use the correct arguments to execl() and it will work as doccumented/expected.

Date: 22 Sep 1994 03:44:30 GMT
Reply-To: bcr@physics.purdue.edu


I was trying to figure out why I can no-longer get high transmittion speeds
(i.e. over 2000cps) for more than about 5 seconds, and I finially traced it
to a SYS_select bug.  The following program isolates the problem:


---> Begin show_bug.c <---
#include <errno.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int
x__select(int nd, fd_set * in, fd_set * out, fd_set * ex, 
        struct timeval * tv)
{
        long __res;
        __asm__ volatile ("int $0x80"
                : "=a" (__res)
                : "0" (SYS_select),"b" ((long) &nd));
        if (__res >= 0)
                return (int) __res;
        errno = -__res;
        return -1;
}

int main(int *argc, char * argv[]) {
  struct timeval timeout;
  long i;

  for(i=0;i<100;i++){
    timeout.tv_sec = 0;
    timeout.tv_usec = (unsigned long int) 10;
    x__select(0, NULL, NULL, NULL, &timeout); 
  }
}
---> End show_bug.c <---

% cc     show_bug.c   -o show_bug
% time ./show_bug
0.000u 0.030s 0:10.88 0.2% 0+0k 0+0io 20pf+0w

The actual time varies each time I run it, but normally the
time is somewhere between 11s to 15s.  So lets use an average
of 13s.  This means each loop takes 130000 microseconds instead
of the specified time of 10 microseconds!!!  This is too slow
for high serial transmittion rates.  I know this bug isn't
in 1.0.9, but I don't know at what point it was introduced.

libc 4.5 has been current for more than six months. I have not

And application software should not be affected by the minor external
changes found in the newer kernels. People are talking about word
processors and spreadsheets, mostly, not low-level network utilities.

This would drive the development progress of Linux down to the level
of a typical commercial OS. You might as well stick with DOS.

You don't. You have, at most, one machine which runs the latest
kernel, on which tests are run. Only if your program encounters
serious problems do you need to upgrade any of the development
machines. 

Updating the kernel takes maybe half an hour to unpack and configure,
and maybe another half hour (on a decently fast machine) unattended to
compile. 

Furthermore, keeping 100 machines up to date is a lot easier with Unix
than with DOS - there are tools for it.
