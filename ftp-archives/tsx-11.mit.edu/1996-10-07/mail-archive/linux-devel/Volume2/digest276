Greets all.

I'm attempting to run the websterd server on linux.

I've gotten the client & server sources that David Curry
wrote at Purdue.

I've managed to get it compiled, but there seems to be
some sort of problem using libdbm.a.  

It compiles and links fine, but for some reason, calls to
dbm_open or dbm_fetch seem to fail.

Does anyone have any sort of inkling of what I speak?

Is dbm the problem here?

Do I need some sort of external dbm software?

I'm running a full Slackware 2.0.1 installation.

Thanks.

It seems that while I am hitting the disk hard on my dx2/66 w/an AHA-1742
host adapter, I miss term packets.  I have a 16550 UART.  Should this be
happening?  It seems my system slows more than I think it "should" while
hitting the disk.  How much work has gone into the 1742 drivers under Linux?

Are they close to optimal?  What about the UltraStor 24F?  Will this be a
superior card under Linux, due to technical superiority and/or a better driver?

Drivers aside, can anyone comment on the rel. technical merits of these 2
cards?

Thanks.

(term is configured properly.  I promise.  Works wonderfully except when I
hit the disk hard.  These event are definitely linked, have done may trials.)

Subject: Help With LCD, Cirrus and XFree86
Date: 7 Oct 1994 02:03:36 GMT

I just got XFree86-3.1 and installed it on my machine.  I have a Cirrus-6440
chipset.  I am trying to run the XF86-SVGA server.  I managed to make the 
server happy by telling it I had a Cirrus-6420 chipset (like the docs say to
do).  When the server comes up, I get a nice, crisp, clear display on my 
LCD notebook, except for the fact that the top 50 pixels or so and the
bottom 50 pixels of the screen are screwed up.  The bottom 50 pixels of the 
display are identical to the top 50 pixels on the display...only shifted by
about 100 pixels.

My question is this:  I have a dual-scan color LCD display and a cirrus 6440
chipset.  Does it make sense for me to determine the video modes for my 
display as discussed in the text file VideoModes.txt?  How do I treat an LCD
display when trying to determine video modes and sync frequencies?  Does my 
problem sound like a video timings problem or does it sound like a problem in
which my server is mis-using VRAM?

Specifically, here is my system:
        1.  Sager NP7500 Notebook/dual scan color LCD (640x480x256)
        2.  1MB VRAM.
        3.  XFree86-3.1

Please e-mail me if you have any suggestions.  Thanks.

-Luke.

VESA is 2 things:

1.  A common BIOS programming interface.
2.  A driver that understand your hardware.

Linux has:

1.  A non-BIOS programming interface.
2.  Good drivers for documented hardware and some drivers for others, too.

If your hardware is not supported by Linux:

1.  Maybe someone is working on it now.
2.  Call your vendor and ask for a "Linux driver".
3.  Call your vendor and ask for full hardware documentation for driver
    development.
4.  Sell your hardware to some DOS loser and get something better.

Yes, there is.
extern inline is used instead of static inline in the function definitions. 
This is a Bad Thing. Without optimization, inline is ignored, thus 
extern inline becomes extern, which means it is not defined. Using static 
inline would mutate to static when not optimizing, which would still work 
(it would not be inline of course, but it wouldn't fail to compile, either).

P.S. Using extern does not require -O2, just -O will work, Still, it would 
be nice to be able to use those functions even when you do not want to 
use optimization.

Probably quite trivial (all you need is an attribute on a directory
that marks it as "look like a file").  A file with multiple data
streams (forks, to use Mac terminology) is nothing but a directory.
However, you would have to teach ls, cp etc about this convention,
which would be a pain.

Remember that FTP is running two simultaneous sessions with the other host, 
a data channel and a control channel.  With only a standard two-wire modem,
the line must be repeatedly turned around from TX to RX and back again.
(Four wire, dedicated-line modems are pricey.)  Services like news and
the web have little upstream traffic, mostly downstream, since they
have no control channel.

We got LOTS of fluff, but no *one* set of it.  That is sort of the main 
difference.  You want standardized interfaces?  Not likely.  A vendor could
provide one -- most of them do.  But linux is a creature of the net, and there
will not be only one GUI interface.

This is arleady avialable.  Try GREAT.  Really.  It takes a while to 
configure, and you should have Motif to get the best performance, but it has
lots of options.

Y'know, the browser from Ghostview is similar to this -- not as advanced,

Again, GREAT -- along with what you can do with .xinitrc, can do this.  There
is also another program out there that does things like this.  Can't 
remember the name, but check them out as they show up. 

Much of your suggestions are really already available, and I don't see any
interest in somehow standardizing them.  Making such bells&whistles available
is one thing, making them ubiquitous is another.  Don't just assume that,
if it isn't in slackware, it's not available.

        The performance penalty is not due to the library being relocated.  It
is because we lose one of the machine registers so that it can be used
to point to the GOT table.  The Intel architecture is painfully short of
registers, so losing one gives a noticable performance impact.

        The only way to avoid the performance penalty is to modify the compiler
to do something like half-pic.  THis way the same pic operands are used so but
are not referenced to the %ebx register - then you can free up the %ebx
register.  Next you need to make sure that the assembler generates sensible
relocations for all of these operands, and then you can generate a shared
library.  Finally you can use some kind of utility to "fast-load" the shared
library at some fixed address and perform the majority of the relocations and
then write the file back out again.  You will also need to modify the dynamic
loader to recognize that the library has already been relocated and properly
load it at the correct address - in this case the addresses would be chosen
locally.  The disadvantage is that with a system such as this the libraries
would be painfully slow before they are "fast-loaded".

        If I were trying to improve performance of ELF libraries, I would
probably try and do something along the lines of what I just outlined.  The
key is to avoid cumbersome build procedures and it simply must be as
idiot-proof as possible. I want to reiterate that for now the concern
is simply to get everything stable and debugged so that it works.  
At the moment there are some C++ issues that should be resolved, and then
we will sit back and pound on it for a while to make sure that it all hangs
together before we release it to the general public.

        Finally, I noticed earlier in this thread that someone said that it was
the performance of linux that was so attractive, and that if we started doing
this sort of thing (i.e. ELF), that they would switch to something like
Solaris.  I found this comment *extremely* amusing, as would anyone else who
had ever used Solaris.  In my new job I have occasion to work on a Solaris
machine, and believe you me, Solaris is the butt of many rather rude jokes, all
of them concerning poor performance.  BTW - Solaris uses ELF, but the
performance problems are apparenetly more to do with the kernel/filesystem
rather than anything else - Unixware also uses ELF, and it is much faster.

I tried this in my XF86Config file. The card is probed correctly as
S3 864 with 20C486 RAMDAC. But the server can't set the clockchip.

What is the problem? Is it the right ClockChip statement? Has anyone
this card running with XFree 3.1?

Right, but introducing a 3000ms latency in the PPP session is not
really acceptable.

I have a interesting question for all you LINUX gurus out there...

Is it posible to create logigal volumes across drives and/or partitions and then mount a single filesystem on that volume? I know it can be done on HP-UX, but I want to do it on my LINUX box?

Cheers

Subject: Freeware Motif/Xview/tty interface library ?

Hi folks,

I'm part of a group writing a set of administration tools for freeware
unixes, and I'm looking for a freeware GUI interface library or class
library that transparently supports or can be made to support several
different interfaces, including Motif, Openlook, Xview, and tty
(curses).  MS-Win, Mac, et al are nifty extras but not necessary.

Sorry for all the cross posting.  Please email responses.  If enough
people are interested, I'll post a summary to comp.windows.x or
comp.windows.misc. 

Thanks !
