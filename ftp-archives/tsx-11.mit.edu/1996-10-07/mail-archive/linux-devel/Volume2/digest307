   I'd rather have garbage in a file than have a file whose blocks
   are also in the free list and will soon be allocated to another
   file as well.  Of course, fsck is supposed to fix these situations.
   But if you're using a filesystem wherein the actual disk updates
   are trailing way behind file system activity, and are not constrained
   to be written in the order they were made, then a crash at a disk-intensive
   time could leave fsck extremely confused.

   This is why BSD ffs does its updates in what somebody called the "wrong"
   order, but which strikes me as exactly the _right_ order.

ext2 doesn't use a free list, but rather uses a bitmap of used/free
blocks.  Making sure this bitmap is correct is perhaps the easiest job
e2fsck has to do.  That's *not* what's going to get it confused.

The one place where a lagged write of the meta data might get the e2fsck
confused is if indirect block of a deleted file gets overwritten by
something else, probably another data block, before the inode table gets
flushed to disk.  In this case, e2fsck *will* notice the inconsistency;
however, it will probably call for human intervention in order to fix
the problem.  

Of course, I've tried to make e2fsck such that the human intervention is
as painless as possible.  For example, e2fsck can automatically take
care of cloning cross-linked files so that each file has its own copy of
blocks claimed by two different inodes.  Of course, at least one of
those files will have garbaged blocks (consisting of data from the other
file) after this operation, but at least the filesystem is stable.  The
human being simply has to examine both of the files and see which one
should be discarded.

In any case, it's a good idea to optimize for the common case, not the
exception case.  Thus, I believe ext2fs made a pretty good tradeoff.
Not doing syncronous meta-data writes gives the ext2fs a blinding speed
advantage over the FFS.  From my experience with both FFS and ext2fs,
ext2fs is just as reliable --- if not more --- than FFS in surviving
unclean shutdowns.

The real problem with this sort of solution is that you have to educate
GCC about segment registers, and you have to include the segment number
into a pointer.  Otherwise, how is GCC supposed to know whether a
pointer was pointing at memory from the library's data segment, or at
memory passed in from the caller?  

I've discussed this problem with GCC hackers who were also Multics
weanies, and this is a very difficult problem.  If it could be solved,
then we could indeed put shared libraries (and even shared memory!) into
separate segments, ala Multics.  This would be very clean from an OS
architectural issue --- unfortunately, it requires a lot of compiler
support that just doesn't exist right now.  

It would also break a lot of programs, since a pointer would be 48 bits,
instead of 32 bits, and there are a lot of programs that assume that the
width of pointer is the same as the width of an integer, or a long.
(This isn't a portable assumption --- but there are still a lot of
programs left over from the "All the world's a Vax" days.)

Date: 12 Oct 94 07:03:04 +0500 EST


According to every manual I have ever read, the accept() system call will load
the passwed sockaddr structure with information about the connecting client. 
According to my tests, this doesn't happen under Linux.  Consider:

#define ADDRESS 3012       /* Some unused user-defined port */

dumb_func()
 {
    char c;
    FILE *fp;
    int fromlen;
    register int i, s, ns, len;
    struct sockaddr_un saun, fsaun;
 
    for(;;)
    {
       /* Set up signal handler for kill 15 and Interrupt */
       signal(SIGTERM, cleanup);
       signal(SIGINT, cleanup);
 
       /* Get a socket to work with.  The socket will be in the UNIX
          domain, and will be a stream socket  
       */
 
       if ((s = socket(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) < 0) 
       {
          perror("server: socket");
          exit(1);
       }
 
       /* Create the address we will be binding to */
       saun.sun_family = AF_UNIX;
       strcpy(saun.sun_path, ADDRESS);
 
       /* Try to bind the address to the socket.  We
          unlink the name first, so that the bind won't fail.
          The third argument indicates the "length" of the 
          structure, not just the length of the socket name!
       */
 
       unlink(ADDRESS);
       len = sizeof(saun.sun_family) + strlen(saun.sun_path);
       /* fromlen = sizeof(fsaun.sun_family) + strlen(fsaun.sun_path); */
       fromlen = sizeof(fsaun);
 
       if (bind(s, &saun, len) < 0)
       {
          perror("server: bind");
          exit(1);
       }
 
       /* Listen on the socket */
       if (listen(s, 5) < 0)
       {
          perror("server: listen");
          exit(1);
       }
 
       printf("\nWaiting for connection: \n");
 
       /* Accept connections.  When we accept one, ns will be connected
          to the client.  fsaun will contain the address of the client.
       */
 
       if ((ns = accept(s, (struct sockaddr_un *)&fsaun, (int *)&fromlen)) < 0)
       {
          perror("server: accept");
          exit(1);
       }
 
       printf("Connection from: %s\n", fsaun.sun_path);
       printf("Connection flen: %d\n", fromlen);
    
       /* We'll use stdio for reading the socket */
       fp = fdopen(ns, "r");
 
       /* We can simply use close() to terminate the connection, since we
             are done with both sides 
       */
    
       close(s);
    }
 
    exit(0);
 }

In the above example, the fsaun instance of sockaddr_un is not getting loaded
properly.  Any ideas?  Everything seems to work fine, it just doesn't load the
client information into the sockaddr structure...

There is a Problem with the memory management. If u request huge
amounts of memory without writing to it, u can request more memory
than virtually are available. If u now start to write into those
pages, the free memory will decrease, the system will swap more and
more, until it is really locked up. Something like SIGWARN (from AIX)
should be impemented, or at least some appropirate (on user basis)
rlimits.

Greetings
Bernd

PS: i patched a quick and drity RLIMIT_NPROC without hte use of an
structure for user-informations. I think it is time to invent an
structure wich is allocated once for each user (a process is running
for), wich can be used to restrict the maximu numbers of processes
for an user, or the maximum amount of virtual memory. This is not
possible on an process-basis.

It doesn't need to.  Any pointer that actually gets passed around in
a program in variables and such is still a 32-bit, absolute, "small model"
pointer as usual.  The only thing that needs to be changed is the method
of accessing or taking the address of a static variable.  To take the
address of a static variable, just convert the segment-register-relative
offset to a global, absolute offset by adding the base address of the
library, and use the resulting absolute pointer thereafter.  This will
work as long as a particular shared library doesn't move around in
a particular process's address space _while_it_is_running_, which would
be rather insane anyway. :-)

Yes, a true multisegmented environment has its attractions, but after
programming in one for a while (i.e. 16-bit DOS), I'd say its disadvantages
are much bigger than its advantages. :-)  But I wasn't proposing a true
multisegmented environment; just a small architecture-specific kludge
to allow the compiler to use a segment register instead of a scarce general
register to remember the library base address in a PIC library.

Besides breaking valid C code, changing cpp to accept // comments as 
default behaviour will also break other utilities which rely on cpp.
For example, if you have in your .Xdefaults:

Mosaic*homeDocument:    http://info.cern.ch

the result will be completely different than what you expect, unless
you use the -nocpp xrdb option, which means removing functionality from
xrdb.

Another example is the Unix Fortran compiler, f77. If it compiles a file
with the .F extension, it will pass the source file through cpp before
compiling it. But // is a Fortran operator! :-)

(October 7th 1994) The amateur development work to port the Linux

This has happened twice in the past two days:

The machine has been running for a few hours.  I'm using EMACS on a short

can't access inode" (I apologize for not having the exact error message, 
I can't find the scrap of paper I wrote it on).  Three-finger-salute does 
not work, machine locks up nicely, and I have to press the reset button.

The machine in question is a 386DX40, 8 megs of RAM, two Maxtors (a 42 
meg and a 540 meg).  The kernel was compiled the day before yesterday 
with GCC 2.6.0, -O2, -m386.  I'm fairly sure that it isn't GCC, as I 
successfully used a 2.6.0-compiled 1.1.51 for almost a month, no incident.

As I've got a really nasty software engineering project due Thursday, I 
do not have the time to debug this one.  I've went back to 1.1.51 (umount

Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon?

> Logical volumes should be easy to implement with userfs.

But then they'd be slow. I think there are three distinct areas that are
typically associated with the concept of logical volumes:

 1) flexible disk space assignment: a virtual storage pool
 2) higher data troughput: striping accross multiple disks
 3) more reliability: checksum drives and/or mirroring

2) and 3) are typically associated with RAID concepts.

1) would be fairly simple to implement, with only a marginal performance
hit. 2) could be easy too, but it may be hairy to administer (e.g. you'd
have to make good guesses about the optimal length of physical reads. Of
course, that may change from cylinder to cylinder.) Another problem with
2) is, that many people would want to be able to use it with sets of
non-identical drives, which would give only partial speed improvements
and/or increase the complexity of configuring such a system.

3) is the hardest part. For 3), you need some extended disk access
scheduling, e.g. write data, THEN write copy (or update checksum),
THEN allow any other writes to related sectors/blocks. Also, some cheap
mechanism to keep the system state after a failure (e.g. power drops
and system is interrupred in the middle of a write, so your block may
be partially corrupted but you can't flag is as "bad" anymore) would
be mandatory. Of course, write buffering in the drive could make all
this just impossible.

Also, 3) requires some good understanding of failure patterns. Since
nowadays, the electronic parts of a disk drive tend to be more likely
to fail that the mechanic parts, you also have to be concerned about
disk controller or (very common !) bus problems. Of course, an easy
but probably adequate solution to the latter would be to declare them
as something that's beyond the scope of such a concept. Let's also
not talk about drive firmware bugs (and yes, you see more of those in
large, less common setups).

Since 1) and 2) significantly increase the average amount of data lost
per time period (if any single drive of a large virtual drive fails,
you might lose an entire huge file system, so the loss increase can be
even quadratic), you either want to have a very good backup policy or,
some security of the 3) type.

Because people generally tend to neglect backups, the result of
implementing 1) and/or 2) without 3) might be that the general
impression of logical volumes would be that they don't work well and
that Linux itself might be unreliable. (Such generalizations happen
all the time - just witness the many claims of file system errors even
if it's very obvious that hardware problems are the real cause.)

Another problem is that building 1) and 2) without taking into account
(i.e. prototyping) 3) might result in a design that makes it hard to
add 3) at a later time.

So, as a poster has already commented, it's not the implementation,
it's the design.

> What about `ifs'?

IFS can be used to extend your file system capacity, but you pay a very
high price in terms of access latency and administrative overhead if you
use it this way, even if you take the old kernel-based one. (And then
you also get a bonus share of unreliability.)

Does 3c503 driver works with 3c505 card?

I tried to configure the kernel to include the 3c503 driver but it don't 
recognize my card. I know the linux has support for all the 3com card except
for 505. I tried my 3c501 card, and it works.

Any help for 3c505 driver?

Thanks for the reply.

Subject: Term blocks modem, switching to VT and back restores?
Date: 11 Oct 94 02:18:17 GMT


I have ATI GUP, 2MVRAM. When I run term and do intensive
communications (xmosaic over term, or some other graphical stwre), I
would get my modem blocked. Term just keeps sending data from remote,
with higher and higher latencies. Nothing will happen on my machine.
In the past, I would have to kill term and seyon, and even than I
wouldn't be able to connect to modem. Sometimes modem would send
responses to requests made minute ago, as it if was backloged. But now
I found a "solution": I such a blockage occurs (for example, I start
xmosaic, having already opend emacs, all via term, and see that
nothing is happening, I move my pointer to emacs window, and see that
cursor would no highlight.) than I switch to VT and back to X, and some
progress will be made. I just went over 20 or so pages of htlm in
mosaic, having had to switch to VT and back few times. It (switching)
just seems to unblock the modem. I am running Xfree 3.1, but same kind
of blocking occurs in 2.1.1. I haven't tested whether this switching
seems to restore the modem in 2.1.1, but I remember now it seem to
did, concidentaly. It ("solution") just occured to me now.

Thing that bothers me are the IRQ jumpers on my ATI/GUP board, with
choice for IRQ3/2/5. However, manual says not to touch this and all
are open now. I tried, some time ago, set it to IRQ 5, but I don't
think it alleviated the problem - I remmember still having those
loockups, although I was looking for smthg else then. (My modem is
running on COM2/IRQ 3 with 14400B/56000 DTE speed. Also tried 38400
DTE). Also ATI is said to use I/O address normaly belonging to COM 4,
and my I/O card is set at COM1/COM4 (since COM 2 is used by internal
modem). I cannot disable COM2/COM4 alltogether.
I reiterate: I do not have problems with Video card, and modem/term,
as long as intensive (bi-directional, it seems) graphic related term
communication takes place. For example, I usually do not have problems
with uploading /downloading files, in term, even at the same time.
Same for running EMACS19 over term. Xmosaic, is an almost sure way to
block the term/modem couple.


Any ideas? (I am running Linux 1.1.52, same happened since at least
1.1.37. Before it was rather OK, although I did not do much with term.
Also I got my ATI/GUP at about the same time.).


                        Thanx,
