I had a similar problem, until I changed rawkeyboard to on in
/etc/dosemu.conf. Odd enough. One would think that having rawkeyboard
off would give less problems, but not so.

Of course, you might have another problem...

 Hello All,

 The Subject says it all. I am *almost* sure my printer uses INT7, as I set it
by tunelp, and it works, and if I set it to another value, it doesn't. Kernel
version is 1.1.49. Could someone hint if one can do something to make the
printer interrrupts counter displayable? Many thanks,

 Andrew Yakovlev.

=====BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE=====

This post is in regards to the login.secure program included in
the shadow-mk package authored by Mohan Kokal.  I, Joseph R.M. Zbiciak,
am the sole author of this program, and would like to dispell any
rumors labeling it as the tool of a "cracker." 

Included in this post is the source code for my /bin/login replacement.

The binary included in the shadow-mk package distributed by Mohan Kokal
was apparently compiled under GCC 2.4.5, using libc 4.4.4.  I base this
statement on the fact that the binary was indeed compiled by me on my
personal Linux box, "asylum," prior to June 9th.  On June 9th, I upgraded
to GCC 2.5.8, and libc 4.5.26.


Inspection of the login.secure binary will reveal that it was indeed
linked with libc 4.4.4.  

Therefore, I seek corroboration of the following, since I cannot
do this myself (my system has no room to dl libc 4.4.4 and gcc 2.4.5 to
try this):

The login.secure binary was most probably compiled as follows:

gcc -o login.secure -s -N -O6 -fomit-frame-pointer -m386 login1.c

(as I said, under GCC 2.4.5, and libc 4.4.4)


Using GCC 2.5.8 and libc 4.5.26 yeilds an executable of 1328 bytes
with these options.  

Let me remind you that the /bin/login on my system has been and continues 
to be the login.secure binary that was included in shadow-mk.  (Size:
1124 bytes.  CRC: a4abbb26)


I have PGP-signed this post to ensure its authenticity.  My public key
is available via finger.  Please finger im14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu.
Pipe the output to a file and run pgp -ka on the file to add the key
to your keyring.  This key is primarily for private messages.  I do not
yet have a well established key for business use.  One will be forthcoming.

Please:  I urge *ANYONE* that has any questions, problems, etc. relating
this program to CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY.  My email address is, once again,
im14u2c@cegt201.bradley.edu.  Should that address fail, there's also
im14u2c@camelot.bradley.edu.  Should both of those addresses fail for one
reason or another, email Mohan Kokal at magnus@cegt201.bradley.edu, with
instructions to forward the mail to me.

And again:  I do apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused
anyone.  The shadow-mk package is not insecure.  The login.secure is
indeed what it was titled.  I do hope that this post lays to rest any
suspicion about the shadow-mk package, its contents, and its author.
I also apologize to Mohan Kokal for not realizing that such a small piece
of code would cause such a large number of people to label him as a
cheap-and-dirty cracker.

One of the original poster's questions is seemingly completely ignored, even
though it is much more relevant than whether chip X or system Y is faster/
cheaper than a Pentuim at Z MHz, so let me ask that question:
 
 WHY is no one even CONSIDERING doing a multiprocessor kernel for Linux?
 It doesn't matter which multiprocessor board, but the fact is that there
 are multiprocessor 486 and Pentium motherboards out there... they are even
 affordable (of all things ;-). OS/2 from IBM comes with a multiprocessing
 kernel (SMP no less...) so it is not impossible, even though it may be 
 hard on a few programmers' sleep.

 I think this should be considered an essential next
 step in the development of a free, high performance OS that runs on just
 about any PC hardware (i.e. Linux) 

 One could probably go on like this for ages, but it probably comes down to
 the fact that the guys doing the slick programming doesn't have the slick
 hardware...<sigh>. Maybe someone should volunteer sending a multiprocessor
 board off to Australia to tempt a certain higly respected kernel programmer!

Cheers
Conrad

however this fault is not seen when i used
libc-...24   im now useing libc....26
if that helps.

On comp.os.linux.admin the source code of login.secure was promised to be posted,
 so there is no more reaseon for blaming people and warnings against using shadow-mk.

In the article in there it is also described what login.secure exactly does, so
 anyone should be happy now :-)

So I can't. Sue me.
I am still trying to get the xntp3p3 source distribution to run. Main
problem currently: Linux kernel includes a kernel PLL which can be
properly adjusted (much superior to usual adjtime behaviour). The
kernel PLL code in the distrib (I think MCC 1.0+), however, calls
*system* calls of the SUN, only. So I will have to tweak sources
quite a bit to get optimal behaviour.

Yes you can.  The point was that the prices for the individual parts
listed in the Pentium system were far more than what they actually cost.
The $6400 Pentium listed would be more like $2700 to anyone that knows
where to look and I don't mean getting low-quality either.

Sure, that would be great.  But it will still be awhile before you will
get more bang for the buck from a non-Intel system.

   ] this would probably be a good idea.  Thoughts?

        In 4.4BSD, immutable and append-only flags can only be set and cleared
   in single-user mode.  It should be easy to make it work the same way in
   Linux: add a system call which specifies the run-level and modify init to
   call it when going into single user mode or multi user mode.  The problem is
   that Linux has many versions of init floatting around and such a solution
   would require that everybody upgrades his init program.

        In the current Linux implementation, only root can change the immutable
   and append-only attribute on a file, in single user mode and in
   multi user mode.

Hmm.  Doesn't this decrease the usefulness of the append-only and
immutable bits?  As I understood it, the rational for adding these
attributes was to make it harder for would-be system crackers to do
serious damage or remove traces of their work.  (i.e., they break in,
hack root, try to remove entries from /var/adm/syslog, and discover
that they have to be in single user mode to do anything except append
to it.)

In any case, bravo on the new addition.  :)

Perhaps I'm missing something important, but has anyone compiled any of
the major applications (Mosaic, ncftp...) for term 2.x (specifically
2.0.4). If I try to run an app compiled for earlier term versions I get
the error "Connect: Invalid Argument".

If nobody's done it yet, I might set aside some time to do it.

Hi!

In article <Cvno0E.IEC@aston.ac.uk> evansmp@mb5194.aston.ac.uk (Mark Evans) writes:

   One problem with the Filesystem side of netware is that there dosn't appear
   to be anything attached to a file which can be used to "fake" an inode number.

I do not think that this is really a problem. You might take a
look at my smbfs (sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/ALPHA/smbfs). smbfs
implements a client for WfW. The protocol used does not give you
a number to identify the file. You only have the path. 

I studied the 'dynamics' of inodes quite a lot, and noticed the
following: You do not really need unique inode numbers for each
file on the complete filesystem. The only inode numbers which
must be unique are those currently in use. All others can be
allocated freely. A little exception to this scheme is a problem
which Philipp Auersperg detected. The getwd() function relies on
the inode numbers given back by readdir(). So you have to keep
the inode numbers of the complete path leading to each inode in
use unique and reproducable. (This is not implemented in
smbfs-0.2, but 0.3 will come soon.)

If I'm completely wrong, please tell me.

I think the main problem with a Novell client is the protocol
itself. All other things should be solvable.
