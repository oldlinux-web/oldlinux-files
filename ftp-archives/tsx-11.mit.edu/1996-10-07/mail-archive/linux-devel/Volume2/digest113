This is not necessary.  The only time you need to run
/usr/mdec/installboot is when you change the root partition you are
booting from, or move /boot.  The reason SunOS doesn't need this when
/vmunix is moved but Linux does is that the /boot (the 2ndary loader)
knows about the file systems.  There is also a limit to the size of
the bootstrap loader on PC style machines which makes the lilo system
much easier.

This has been true of SunOS since at least sos3.5 (though I've never
installed anything older than 4.1 myself.)

If it annoys you, remove the
        #define KBD_REPORT_ERR
in drivers/char/keyboard.c.
It is your keyboard sending a 0xff scancode, traditionally used
for keyboard errors. (Some keyboards generate them when you press
several keys simultaneously. The FK9000 sends it when you press
a calculator key.)

The patch I distributed this Spring (and will put in the next kbd-0.*
this month) does dynamic allocation of consoles.
This means that you can create a virtual console of a given size,
switch to it, and use a svgalib or dosemu utility to inform the videocard
of the change. No doubt someone will produce a "change text mode"
utility that combines these two steps.

Hmm... Try looking at the permissions for /tmp (use 'ls -ld /tmp'). They
should be something like:
drwxrwxrwt    3 root        root           1024 Sep  2 20:42 /tmp/
(i.e. the first, third, and fourth columns should be the same).

The Linux float and double formats are the same IEEE formats used by Microsoft 
C/C++. If you can get BC++ (which I am not very familiar with) to emit floats 
in a Microsoft compatible format, you are winning.

Just where exactly do people get ideas like that? If you would think about it 
a bit, you would realize that a 16-bit float, even WITHOUT an exponent, 
wouldn't represent a full 5 decimal digits of precision; in other words, 
roughly half (or less) than your el cheapo scientific calculator! Surely, $200 
math coprocessors can do better than that!

Linux floats as well as Microsoft floats under DOS are 32-bit (23 bit 
mantissa, 8 bit exponent, 1 sign bit); doubles are 64-bit (52 bit mantissa, 11 
bit exponent, 1 sign bit).

Date: Fri, 2 Sep 1994 01:34:45 GMT

I have been successfully accessing multiple NetWare servers by running 
DOSEMU un Linux.  Since NetWare is a DOS based OS inorder to function as 
a true NetWare client you need to run DOS (or OS/2 or a MAC).  NetWare's 
support of non-DOS clients is ok but not great.

You can mount NetWare volumes via NFS and access the server console via 
XConsole -- as you've already seen -- but to access the server as a true 
client you would need some kind of DOS.  This also depends on what you 
want to do.  If you just need file access NFS should suit your needs.  If 
you need to do NetWare admin (users, maint., etc.) then you would need a 
DOS client.

Subject: Re: Future of linux -- the sequel

I think you are not right saying Linux is technically obsolete before
Solaris or another commercial U*IXes. My personal experience says that
Linux is both technically superior now (compare it with SunSoft ISC,
Coherent, SCO) and *much quicker* in development. Linux has a tremendous
developers base, and i think, is one of the most popular U*ices.
When you speak about microkernals, you make a popular bug - microkernal
doesn't mean it is easier to port. As a devloper of several microkernel
embedded systems, i should say it is not so easy to port the kernel, which
is tightly tied with processor, MMU, bus logic and so on to another platform.

I don't want to start the flame war, but i'm sure Linux is *the best* U*IX
now for PCs, and, i trust, for another platforms in near future.

and although I can set the IRQ and Base I/O address with jumpers, I couldn't
set the shared memory address.  The cards I work with at work are genuine
SMC cards and I simply hard jumpered their settings.  Most WD8013 cards

I've switched my card over to NE2000 mode just to be sure.

Well, I'll give it a try. 

The C error that you are getting claiming that an identifier 
(sb_dsp_operations) is being used without a definition (C doesn't
care for that kinda thing), which makes me thing that perhaps you
are missing an include file somewhere, or that some patch failed
miserably.

First, where did you get the kernel source tree? Did you download a complete
source tree, or a set of patches? If you downloaded a set of patches,
did you apply them all in order, and were there any errors?

My recommendation would be to ftp to sunsite.unc.edu, get 1.1.45, and patch 
46-whatever, backup and remove your old one, then install and try the new one.

   I don't think so...

   - LILO does not require the boot image to be on contiguous sectors

   - LILO can boot many different kernels and also other operating systems

   I think it is a good program, and running its installer after building
   the kernel is not a problem at all.  It is even done in the same
   "make zlilo" command.

Would LILO prevent a self-defragmenting filesystem?

Try 1.1.48 - 'pseudo dma' transfers (see the NCR5380 data book / 
Linux driver sources for details) were being done for neither tapes
nor CD ROM drives, resulting in increased CPU usage with these 
devices and most NCR5380 boards.

Have you tried using double in DOS? You could be having the same int/long
