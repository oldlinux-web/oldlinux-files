Through the standard UNIX file system facilities one can easily define a
"spec" for storing "resources" of a file. NEXTSTEP does just this and
refers to the concept as "app-wrappers". Programs contain directories
and resources required for running them. 

The name of the directory is always ".app" so the file manager can know that
the folder is a program inside.

For example..(not a NeXT example, but rather a UNIXish example)

Backgammon.app     <directory>
Backgammon.app/Backgammon          <file of same name is the program executable>
Backgammon.app/whiteCircle.tiff    <tiff image of the white playing piece>
Backgammon.app/blackCircle.tiff    <tiff image of the black playing piece>
Backgammon.app/local-config        <some machine configuration>

There can be more to it than this obviously. This setup allows applications
to stay contained in their own directory structure though. So you don't end
up with the same program installed in a unix standard way

/usr/local/bin/X11/Backgammon                       <executable file>
/usr/local/lib/games/Backgammon/whiteCircle.tiff    <tiff image>
/usr/local/lib/games/Backgammon/whiteCircle.tiff    <tiff image>
/usr/local/etc/Backgammon/local-config              <config>

(don't flame about the specific placement of those files, it's not
relevant... this is just to prove a point)

A similar type of app-wrapper setup could easily be put on any UNIX standard
system, however applications would have to use it in order for it to be
usefull on a system-wide basis.

I at one time thought of setting up a standard way for X apps to be 
app-wrappered. I trying to think of ways to make it easy to modify
existing applications to look for their files this way. That way it would
not take forever for it to become usefull. However, I did not have the time
to actually take on this project.

So?  There is no law against making proprietary extensions, and *many*
compilers have added the // comment as an extension to the C language,
so you cannot trust code that relies on it not being there anyway.  It
has been speculted this extension may make its way into the next
revision of ANSI C.

As you may have noticed, when I posted the fix for making current
versions of gcc accept this, I made sure that the -ansi (strict ANSI
conformance) disables this option.

I've got the Nexstor NCR53c810 with a Pentium 60 on an intel board and I cant

Because the linux-activists mailing list strips message-ID information
when digestifying, and hence it is not possible to prevent your

list.

No.  I brought it up on the NORMAL channel a long time ago, and I was
"strongly discouraged" from making a big announcement about it.  I
would have to get in touch with a bunch of people before announcing
anything "official", and I don't have time for that right now.

Of course, I started this as a way for myself to read linux-activists
in a bit more manageable form, then I started getting requests for
feeds when someone saw my followup line posted... but I really didn't
expect to feed this many sites all over the world... from my Linux

No, it's not at all.

1: File operations do not work the same.  Try gzipping a directory
   without tar.
2: There is no way to recognize these directories as complete units.
3: File managers will open them as directory trees, because that is
   what they are, NOT record type files.

This would almost do the job.  cp, gzip and such would need to treat
it as a file though, without tar.  I do think a simple flag is still
needed to avoid the filename extension mess DOS uses to recognize
executables.  This would need to be done in a standard way so that
all the shells, filemanagers, and file utilities would recognize the
directory as a complete unit.

   To clarify, what I believe you're asking about is the ability to create a
   logical filesystem/volume which spans physical volumes, i.e. a 3GB
   filesystem spanning 3 1GB drives.

   No, I don't believe anyone's done this yet.  Other commercial Unices which
   allow this include Data General's DG-UX, where I first saw the feature.
   It _is_ nice...  but it would be murder to hack into the kernel, I

This sounds like a dangerous mess.  If a drive crashes, would you rather

I've been experiencing this one quite a bit lately, as well (since I
started my network).  Occassionally and for no apparent reason, the
route table entry for the network is just "forgotten."  After re-
issuing the route command once or twice, it will stick.
        Both my installations are based on Slackware 1.2.  One is
the stock 1.0.8 kernel and uses a 3COM Etherlink III 3c509.  The other
is 1.1.49 on a laptop with a 3COM 3c589 and David Hinds' PCMCIA
package.  I use BNC between these boxes at home.  I have attached the
laptop via UTP to the network at work and never experienced this.  I
also have a stock 1.0.8 at work that I have never seen this with (also
UTP).  However, I rarely get to use Linux for more than 30 minutes or
so on the network at work.

   But the question still remains: Why do you want this???

   You say you would like a "main fork" in a file and then various
   "attribute" forks. Why this is better than a directory I don't know.
   Why should there be one "main" fork? And why are you too lazy to use cp -r
   to copy them?

   What if you start to want forks with sub-forks. Soon you'll start to want
   the full facilities of directories, and we might as well leave it the way
   it is.

   Don't be influenced by the over-featurism that NT offers. There's no need
   for this crud.

Don't be influenced by the over-featurism that Linux offers.  CP/M
is simple, therefore it must be better.  There's no need for all
the overhead of protected memory, device files, file sizes, attributes,
etc.

Here's something interesting... my echo reply packets come back
from my slip server with [tos 0xd].  It is my understanding
that only one tos bit should be set at a time.  Anyone know
why this would happen?

The terminal server is a LANTRONIX EPS-4 Terminal Server Version 
V2.2/28(930223).


In any case, I still can't be sure the problem isn't in the
kernel since when I transfer files from linux --> remote machine
my response time is just as bad.  In this case, there is no
modem buffer and even if the terminal server didn't support
tos queueing, the only packets it could queue would be acks
from the remote machine and my interactive packets!  Even linear
queueing of these packets should result in decent interactive
response.  (interactive response is to the server, ftp is 
beyond the server)

Any comments, opinions, answers?

There are definitely problems with pointer conversion; you cannot
simply interrogate the FS register to find it's base addess, you have
to look at the MMU table entries, and they're in protected kernel
space, so you'd need a system call, etc.  Plus it would require a
change to the compiler to generate code that used, say, FS:offset
addressing for library data.  I suspect the frequency of the pointer
conversions required would kill performance to a far greater degree
than PIC would.

Subject: Looking for X graphics/ Plotting libraries
Date: Tue, 11 Oct 1994 16:01:00 -0400 (EDT)


I am working on a small project, and need some library routines to do 
some simple X windows graphics: Pop open a window, take some disk data, 
and graph the data in the window with auto-scaling, axis, etc. SInce I 
want to spend more time on the data producing side of the program, I need 
a package that can do the plotting for me.

Thanks,
Pratik
