More so to be flattered that INN was written well to allow such
"evolution".


>and might even get better performance 

I am not convinced we would get better performance based on current news
volume and system capabilities.

I am more concerned about 5-10X volumes. CPU's are getting faster.
Disk interfaces and overall FS performance is not improving as fast as
news volume is growing. 

CNEWS first, and then INN have made great strides in news system performance. 
I am grateful! :-)

I could not run this site with CNEWS now, and I worry about where the
next /r$ will come from for the next perf leap. IE: we need to do what
you and Henry/Geoff did, start the "next generation" before we
absolutely need it. :-)

>and (I'm not holding my breath on these last two)
>be portable and free, >>it won't be INN.<<

Agreed. When I hear my pet DB labbie talking in 30k transactions per second
or minute, (it does not matter). I realize it will be hard to "home grow" 
something that performs at that level. 

I am no SQL fan, but it should allow portability at least at the DB
level. I see new (serious) apps that do not specify the DB, but
allow you to use the one your company has selected. (for presumably the
right reasons.) I like this idea.

So how do we provide this fuctionality to people who do not have a serious 
DB? I guess we just don't! 

If you are at the 1-5GB news spool level, you are probably not an 
individual, and would be willing to spend some money (on a commercial DB) 
to achieve performance and add new features. (I like my CDROM style total 
keyword idea.) :-)

We can "specify/design" what we need to include in the DB as data or
index's for free. Then and only then do we code. Then someone with INN
and an ORACLE/INGRESS/INFORMIX/SYBASE/ALLBASE license tests it.
(probably at least the code person, as a start) :-) No big deal, JASMOP.  :-)

Oh well, in everyone's copious spare time, I guess. :-)

Even after applying the atdisk patches to the latest kernel 1.1.50, I
cannot get it to recognize my second HD controller.
When I reboot, the following error occurs:
HD1 controller still busy: status 0xd0
HD1 controller times out ...
and the error message keeps repeating ...
I don't know why but I will try the latest 1.0 patch and see if it
works for my card.
BTW, I use IRQ 10 both on the card and in hd1.c

Anyone knows whats the problem>?

The linux versions I have used (yggdrasil fall 93, summer 94) have
a hard coded restriction on the block size.
(look in the /usr/src/linux/fs/isofs/*.[ch] files for ISO_BLOCKSIZE)

When inserting a iso9660 cdrom with a blocksize != 2048 

fall 93   : wrong fs type, already mounted, busy or other error.

summer 94 : blocksize != 1<< blockbits

I don't know the reason for this restriction, but I have a CDROM
with 512 byte blocks, and will try to modify the isofs.

I think you must do the same.

Subject: Partitioning Question
Date: 12 Sep 1994 18:09:47 GMT

So once I set my partitions (say 250 for Linux and 270 for DOS) using FIPS
or FDISK - is there a way to resize the Linux partition?  I mean, is there a
way other than backing up all the data on the Linux partition, deleting that
partition, then resizing the DOS partition, then remounting the Linux partition,
then restoring the data on it.

I've downloaded quite a bit of stuff for installing Linux.  I don't remember
exactly, but I think it was all the a,ap,x,xd,xv and a few other disks (all the
gnu stuff too).  All tolled, I think I've got about 40+.  The HOWTO says a
ROUGH estimate is about 2.5 megs per disk.  I'm just not sure how much to
allocate for this thing.  250 seems fine but I would love to get away with 200
so DOS would have more room to breathe.

Thanks,

Hiho

Before you start flaming at me that device drivers don't do file-io, I will
tell you what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to write a block device driver
that combines several block devices to one device (especially useful
for people with a few smaller hard discs). Much of the management stuff
is already done, but I need to access the devices I want to combine to one.
I've tried it the simple way by using the normal open(), close(), read(),
write() system calls, but already open() fails (with "Bad address" error).
Can someone give me a hint please?

                                        Matthias

PS: The device driver is written as a loadable module.

PPS: How do I officially obtain a device (major) number?

Hmm.  Let me try this on the above line.

Hey, it worked for me.  Let's see if I can drag it out of the buffer

Yep, worked again.

Of course, I'm using nvi 1.32.  vim is ok, but nvi 1.32 has nicer
extensions.  I dumped vim because of that backup file nonsense,
and later learned it could be configured not to make backup files,
but by that time I was hooked on nvi.  I'm even disappointed when
I log into a Unix system and it's running regular vi.

Better yet, don't even bother with Linux, let alone the right 
vi to run under it!  After all, the kernel (ver .10) goes into infinite
loops if you have any non-IDE drives in the system, runs out of memory 
quickly because it doesn't swap to disk...

In other words : if you want to run old, alpha versions of software,
you're free to do so.  Just don't expect them to work well, and 
don't expect the same bugs to carry into newer versions.

I run nvi 1.21, and historically, it's the most accurate of 
all the vi clones I've used.  It's also eight bit clean,
does split screen in text mode (aka Emacs, uemacs, vile, 
etc), doesn't puke on complicated regexes the way Elvis 
does, etc.

The Mac people had the problem that "deleted" files (i.e. files in the
trash) disappeared at semi-random times, eg. when shutting down the Mac
or when starting a program. This was such an user interface hassle that
the Mac OS now only deletes the trash when you tell it to.

The second problem is that unless you're very careful, you'll get
fragmentation. Lots of it. I once had a Netnews partition on an old-style
Sys5 file system (i.e., no free block bitmap). The thing was about 80%
fragmented after a month of continuous use (i.e., a 100-k file needed 80
seeks. Ugh). Avoiding the same situation for a file system with undelete is
not at all easy.

The third problem is how to associate the file with whatever directory it
was in when it got deleted. This gets _very_ messy when there are links on
the file which you as Joe User don't know anything about. For instance:

- I create File A
- My coworker hard-links it into his directory
- I decide to delete the thing
- I change my mind, type "unrm", am very astonished that the file is not
  unrecoverable, and write a confused mail to the author of the unrm
  program.
If the undelete system decides to keep changes, would my coworker be able
to get at an old version? How? How do I control whether he can or cannot do
this -- a separate set of permissions for deleted files? How complex _can_
you make "rm" and why would you want to? ;-)

Related to this is a fourth problem, which is that you have to remember
where links to an unremovable file have been if you need the space.
(Remember that under Unix, the traditional directory-to-inode mapping is
one-way, which 
Offhand, I can't think of a solution which is neither a performance nor a
