I'm having a problem with hdparm as well. I invoke hdparm -m16 /dev/hda,
and I get this message:

But when I read /var/adm/messages, I came across this:

I quite sure that my system can do 16-sector multiple mode, because I've had
great success with similar shareware programs for Messy-DOS. The hard drive
subsystem is a Conner CP3044 IDE drive, hooked up to a generic 16 bit

Subject: Serial port problems
Date: 6 Sep 1994 08:26:45 GMT

Hi,

as the subject says i am having problems with the serial port with
ALL linux kernels, when switching to speeds higher than 19200 baud.
from 38400 baud on onward i have to experience data losses.

My system with an i486 DX-2/66 has a pci motherboard with saturn
chipset. the controller is a so called SMC 37C663 Super I/O Controller,
which incorporates control for serial and parallel ports, floppy and
ide controller.
the manual says there are 2 NS16C552 compatible UARTs which support
FIFO. Are these UARTs incompatible to the serial driver provided by
linux ?
it appears to me that hardware flow control is failing (it definitely
works when trying under dos).

hoping for an answer,

        Joerg

At least for the networking there are enough 'live and dangerous' systems
that most bugs are either obscure and few people see them or they turn up
quickly. I do some regression testing, but my primary test mode is that
www.linux.org.uk is normally running the latest and greatest netcode and
taking a battering. I'd like to set up a major IRC hub under Linux at some
point to really give it some 24hr/day nastiness.

Naturally anyone who wants to write and provide a complete test suite for
the Linux tcp/ip is more than welcome 8)

Get the up to date bootpd from sunacm.swan.ac.uk in the

The printer interrupt is only grabbed when the device is open.  Try
something like

        sleep 10 > /dev/lp1 &
        cat /proc/interrupts

(Or perhaps "cat /proc/interrupts < /dev/lp1".)

Another problem with the floppy driver:
It complains (probably the background autoprobe) when, as in my case,
there *is* no floppy in the machine.

And when one turns up after initialization, it can't find it.

I have a removable PCMCIA floppy, and am trying to write a card services
module for it, so that it works - but time and the size of the floppy
driver are incompatible quantities.....

There is an ISDN driver that is unfortunately based on a heavily
patched kernel (but works well). It currently supports only the Teles
"dumb" ISDN card (the cheapest :-) and the German ISDN standard.

Got a hacksaw and a broken 16bit PC card. Get the PC edge connector list
from a diagram, find out where the IRQ is fed out of your 8 bit card -
normally its one side of a run of jumpers, hook a wire into a bit of 16bit
card stuck in the 16bit part of the slot and go.

Thanks to all that have responded to my message. A number

Hello..
I've decided to add the "Linux Inside" and the "LINUX.. The choice of a GNU 
generation" T-Shirts, since they are so popular. Please don't mail me any
payment, be it Visa numbers, or Cheques, money orders, etc, yet. I will
mail you when the T-Shirts are printed, and then get the details, before
I send them. 

"Linux! Not UNIX!" T-Shirts are either, Black on White, Navy Blue on White, 
or White on Black, Long or Short Sleeved T-Shirts. "Linux! Not UNIX!" is
written on the back of the shirt, and on the front left corner a neat litle
"Linux." is printed.

"Linux Inside" T-Shirts have the "Linux Inside" Logo, by Rick Lyons, printed
on either Long or Short sleeved. White T-Shirts. I will only print a limited
amount of these T-Shirts, so please get your order in now.

"Linux.. The Choice of a GNU Generation" T-Shirts have the slogan printed in
Black across the back of a Long or Short sleeved, white, T-Shirt. With  
"Linux." printed on the front.

Thank you.

In the case of the Linux kernel this isn't too drastic. Firstly there is almost
no core operating system assumption about strings present. The single glaring
one is the '/' symbol and ascii NUL. An encoding that keeps ascii NUL
special is a good idea from C points of view. The / would need the kernel
to know the basic primitive rules to spot / as opposed to a / as part of
a 16bit symbol. Keeping this straight when doing NFS with a non multi
lingual system will be fascinating 8).

X windows does. Its fair to say its not exactly used a lot but X can do it.

Yes. There are standard tools and library functions for this already in the
current kernels. Again they 'think' 8 bit bytes still but the basics are
there to be extended on including things like foreign dates, foreign
collation orders (sorting) etc. Stuff like the C library is already 
internationalised, and having seen how irritating a German release is to
English people I'm now trying to internationalise the network tools. The
current stuff isn't really sufficient as far as I can see for 16bit unicode
although its close to it and since I'm quite new to the nlcat functions
I may have missed something.

setlocale is needed because some issues are not resolved by Unicode -
notably things like dates and collation orders. For some languages other
areas like ascii -> integer conversions change rules too. Those will really
be much more complex.

I shall take a good look at the encoding schemes one day but I suspect 
unicode file names are not a serious issue. Someone has apparently worked
on the console driver. Linux International are working on
internationalisation using the Unix nlcat stuff - a step in the right
direction but probably not all the way.

>Am I babbling nonsense, or am I making sense?

You are raising issues that most people don't care about or need, but which
I suspect you are right in believing will matter some day.
