Subject: de620 and Compaq aero, rx_page problem ?
Date: 6 Oct 1994 18:21:33 GMT

Hi,

I'am trying to get a de620 pocket adapter running on a compaq contura
aero 4/25. The system consequently works (pl51), but /var/adm/syslog
fills up with messages 

        Page link out of sync
        Run overrun

Some study of de620.c shows that both messages concern the page-count
the adapter returns, which is found to be inconsistent by the driver.

i was wandering about a few things:

        - is it possible that there is more memory in my DLINK-620 
          adapter then in the one owned by the writer of the driver ?

        - could the problem be caused by a defect/slow parallel port ?

        - does anyone already solved this problem, if not, i'll have
          a go.

ps. the system can communicate over the adapter, by the network
becomes a mess. For example, ping reports a lot of DUP's 

thanx,

Jan

Also, does anyone have a modem which has a configuration to

        reduce the send buffer size
        lower the flow-control bit sooner (when the send buffer
                reaches x bytes)

This is the type of requirement which I don't think many manufacturers
have anticipated, so I doubt it's common.  But since the newest
fastest modems are more and more used for SLIP/PPP _maybe_ it has been
considered for those.

You can maybe try to reconfigure your card to some other
interrupt settings using the DOS tool that probably came
with it.

I tried a 3C509 and 3C503 on LINUX and they both work fine
using IRQ5 and base 0x300.
I use the slackware version 2.0.0.

FYI,

Some guy posted a message to the Linux activists mailing list recently
saying that they had committed themselves to finishing the port before
January. He said that he had nothing else to do during that period.

Personally I'm beginning to wonder whether it's worth the time and
effort it will take to port Linux to the Mac. The hardware is continually
changing, the CPU has changed.... The only thing we're guaranteed are
a few Mac OS calls, and every so often those get revised as well.

IMHO, it would be a better strategy to just port all of the utils
and programs to the Mac instead of the actual OS, writing a library
of funcitons to make the Mac OS look like Unix. That's what I've
done for my C Shell (though that's a commercial product).

The only problem there is that Unix data types are different from
mac os types, e.g. the mac uses a 64 bit process signature, whereas Unix 
is 32.

And it never will...

As far as I know, noone succeeded to convince the NEC 765-Chip
to read 128 Bytes/Sektor _in_Double_Density_. This was known
in good old CP/M - times... I owned a Floppy-controller with
the Western Digital Chip, and it was able to produce and read
such Disk's. The S-100 Board from JADE, one of many ALTOS-Formats
and a german Maker (Felltron) used such sectorsize on 8-Inch
DD-Disks. [see thr german magazine C'T 6/1985 page 120ff]
No CP/M-Diskformat I know of used more than 1024 B/S.
Some DOS Copy-protection used the higher sector-sizes.

In _Single_Density_ the NEC-Chip can well use 128 B/S.

It would be nice to get aquivalences of ANADISK / TELEDISK
and 22DISK to Linux...

You should mount your /dev/sda when booting
/etc/fstab:
...
/dev/sda2       /<DOS-MOUNT-POINT> msdos        (flags, see mount(8))
...

The last line gives an error message while booting, which you can ignore.
After that your autoexec.bat from /dev/sda it executed.

I think useing simply system V semaphores (if compiled in into the
kernel) is more efficient and direct. See 'man 5 ipc' if you have the
Linux Programmers Manual man-pages installed.

But unfortunately you can't specify the address yourself.  It blindly
takes the address it finds in the From: line.  This loses badly when your
address has changed, or the translation of the From: address which happens
in the mail routers has changed.

I have experienced already two times that the only way to unsubscribe was
to write a message to the operator :-(

Mailing to the list should be no problem, though.

You may get some negative feedback from the die-hard functionality
over form crowd, but I'd say there's a lot of truth to what you're
saying-- cleaning up minor things like GUI look & feel *will* make the
X environment more appealing to a lot of people (maybe this is
unfortunate, but with all the "fluff" on a typical Mac/Windoze desktop
nowadays a lot of people expect this kind of thing...)

Some ideas along this line that I've thought about:

1) A mouse-driven tool for setting common X resource preferences would
be *very* helpful, even for experienced users (kind of a big project,
I know).  Hewlett-Packard workstations include this as part of the
HP-VUE desktop-- you can adjust window colors, background pixmaps,
speaker pitch & volume, screensaver status, etc. from a "control
panel"-like utility.  There are too many things under X that can be
configured only from the command line, which is not good (ideally both
a good GUI and command-line way of setting each option should exist).
        An extension of this idea might involve using GetWidetTree
calls to a selected application to find out what resources can be set
(like editres does), filtering out those that are obviously used only
internally, and providing some kind of nice front-end for altering
these (and saving them to .Xdefaults, which would be automatically
"xrdb -load'ed" on exiting the preferences tool).  HP-VUE even allows
some things to be changed on the fly in already-running clients, but I
think support for this has to be specially compiled into each client.
Maybe a drop-in replacement for some of the X shared libraries could
allow existing binaries to support this, though?

2) A better X file manager than what's currently out there (xfm &
xfilemanager are nice but not as easy to configure, easy to use, or
generally polished as one might like).  Maybe something that provided
essentially the same functionality as Mouseless Commander (the
text-based Norton Commander clone), but with a mouse-driven GUI? (&
provisions for icons if desired, scrollbars on the dual file selection
lists, real pulldown menus-- leave in the command line at the bottom,
though!).
        Well, you mentioned NextStep-- on second thought, something
similar to the wonderful NeXT Workspace Manager application would be
delightful to have.  For those who have never seen it, this program
(in its Browser mode) presents a group of side-by-side vertical
directory listings, with each column representing a level of the
directory hiearchy... selecting a subdir. name from one list opens a a
listing of that directory onto the column to the right.  It's very
similar to Xarchie's user interface (with the MultiList widget)-- the
column set scrolls horizontally so there's no limit to how deep you
can go.  Above each column, a single icon is shown for the selected
entry ("pouches" for directories, appropriate icons for other file
types), and above that is a "shelf" area where icons can be dragged to
for quick access or future use.  For copying/moving/linking, you can
either use the shelf as a temporary holding area or open multiple
browser windows at once...
        Workspace manager has other view-modes as well (Mac-like
window full of icons, detailed single-column directories...), but
Browser is the most unique.


3) Another idea from HP-VUE... this environment features a "console
bar" area at the bottom of the screen, containing buttons to switch
virtual desktops, invocation icons for commonly-used apps, small icons
for system functions (logging out...), and space for a clock,
calendar, Xload bargraph, & other stuff.  The appearance of the bar is
very professional, with little beveled insets for each item.  I'm
thinking that something similar could be done for fvwm by simply
creating a "wrapper" program that allows existing X apps to be run as
borderless, titlebarless child windows within its confines, creating
the nice bevels or whatever around each inset client.  Good clients to
embed might include xclock/dclock/oclock/whatever, xload, xmem,
xsysinfo, fvwm GoodStuff (for launching apps), the fvwm pager,
xpostit, etc. etc...
        For those like myself who have less screen resolution than
they want and like to conserve it ;-), another good feature this
"toolbar" app could provide would be to find the optimal geometries
for packing the configured child clients into as small an area as
possible, for a given overall rectangular area and position (and
minimum sizes for each child).  I have my .xsession set up to start
the fvwm pager, xpostit, xload, xsysinfo, and dclock (from
Interviews), all nicely packed together in the upper-left corner of
the desktop (borderless and "sticky").  Finding all the -geometry
AxB+C+D settings down to the pixel was kind of tedious, though, and
that's the kind of thing computers should be doing for us!  Options
for a decorative border a la HP-VUE around the area would be cool as
well.  Of course, this client should be configurable in a GUIish way
for user-friendliness, with the option to just edit an rc file for
experts...


Just thought I'd throw those ideas out-- things I've thought about
writing myself some day but probably won't for a while (until I learn
more about X programming at any rate...)

Not sure, but maybe you need to add '-b 1' to 'tar' so as to comply with
the 512 bytes block size limit?

I tried this in my XF86Config file. Die card ist probed correctly as
S3 864 with 20C486 RAMDAC. But the server can't set the clockchip.

What is the problem? Is it the right ClockChip statement? Has anyone
