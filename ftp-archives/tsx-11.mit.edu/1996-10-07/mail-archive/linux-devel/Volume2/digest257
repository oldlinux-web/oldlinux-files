There's a solution to this.

You can only relocate the library to one address, for the reason you
cite. However, there's no reason this should be done at link time,
when you build the library.

How about dynamically relocating the library when it's loaded - once.
Then the address it appears at can be determined at run time; that way
it cannot possibly conflict with any other libraries; the library
loading mechanism would pick addresses so that doesn't happen. Then
when other processes add it, it would appear at the same address in
every process.

This gives fast non-PIC code without the primary problem associated
with having non-PIC code, the fixed addresses.

Far as the jump table/data area: the Amiga Exec solved this problem by
having the jump table grow in one direction, and the data in the
other, from the library base pointer.

Is someone working on implementing shared (level triggered) interrupt

motherboards will require sharing interrupts.

BTW, edge-triggered interrupts are not PCI-compliant and will prohibit
the use of e.g. multiport adapters with bridge chips, some multi-

 Well I seem to have a problem here. I just got a full block of Ip 
address from my provider. What the problem is that I cant seem to get the 
other Linux box on the etho to see me when I use the ip address they gave 
me. Here is the set up Linux 1.1.50 compiled with Ip forwarding enabled.

  -------
  -     - Internet Provider
  ------- 199.86.32.100
     |
     | PPP Connect Modem
     |
     |                          The Block I was assigned was

   ------  199.199.16.50
 
  Now Is there any way that he can go out to the outside world without
telneting to my machine? At this point he cant get to me. I was told that 
there had to be a router in between the etho and my machine so that the 2 
different address could see each other. Because they should be on the 
same block showing that they are on a local net. All I want to do is be 
able to go to the out side world with out telneting from the other box to 
the one that has the modem on it. Then I will work on the dial up service 
for the slip and ppp connects. Any help would be appriceated..

Subject: Text modes?

Hmm... I've been wondering about the text mode sync frequencies. Can
they be changed like the XFree86 graphics modes? It just seems somewhat
of a waste to use normal VGA frequencies (what's it, 60 Hz?) with a much
better monitor...

Oh yes, I have a Cirrus Logic CL-GD5426 (1 Mb) ISA card.

Also, would it be theoretically possible to use, say, a 12*30-sized font
(80x25 on a 1024*768 resolution) in text mode? From what I know of
display adapters, it seems that they only support 8-dot-wide (or in some
cases (Hercules) 9) characters. Is this right?

Of course I could switch in to graphics mode, but then I could as well
just use X (graphics mode is always a bit slower though)...

/usr partitions check forced" (or something to that effect).  After the fschk

I have an Adaptec 1542CF SCSI-2 controller and am booting linux from a 540mb

Yes; I've done it.  Not under linux though.  If I don't like the
mode I just find a better mode in the VGA-card manual and adapt the
kernel, in my experience there's always a good one in there.

>Also, would it be theoretically possible to use, say, a 12*30-sized font

I think more or less any height can be programmed, but the width
must be 8 pixels, optionally with the last pixel duplicated.

(All this is for VGA and EGA, btw.)

Nope.

First, ANSI C doesn't define a 'Word', neither a 'word'.

Second, an 'int' can hold at least the values from -32768 to 32767,
but is possibly much larger.  An 'int' on Linux is 32 bits, on a
Cray it's 64.

>A long is 32 bits.  The registers of a 486DX (as

The registers of a 486SX also have 32 bits, it't the external
bus that's 16 bits.

The OS (Linux) doesn't have any concept of 'words'.

And what about those of us that DON'T see it?  Basic setup is a
dedicated PPP link on a 14.4 dialup, NET-3 stuff, ppd 2.1.2a,
etc., with an InfoMagic/TransAmeritech CD-ROM combined install.

I move many megabytes of files around via FTP daily, and another
many megs around with mosaic and lynx.  Sendmail+IDA's been
rock-solid.

The AMPR code is still beta-stuff, I think.  Do you really need it?
Also, are your users using ncftp or 'stock' ftp?  Aside from the X25
stuff in your kernel, and the fact your dialin users are seeing/causing
this, there probably isn't much difference in the way we do things.
I have no dialup users.  So, if that's any help, there might be 
something in the way your getty handles buffering (if there is
such as thing); I use agetty.

        That has always been my biggest gripe.  However, their developers and
others usually pay attention to and answer the usenet groups.  The latest versions
of the C compilers and development environments for the Mac usually handle a lot
of that stuff.

        *IMHO*, not really.  I ported CP/M 68K to the Mac (the product didn't sell,
but that is what my boss paid me to do.), within the first 4 months of its release.  
Currently, all 68K 
Mac programs run in supervisory mode.  You could actually run linux as a task under
the Mac OS.  You could take over several interrupts to service linux.  Once that
was done, you could conceivably run the mac code that provides a mac shell to their
AIX unix platform, with a lot of work.  

        In order to preserve the ability to be a Mac as well as a linux box (I know,
heresy!), you can put the linux fs inside a Mac compatible file.  That is how the
2nd port to CP/M worked.  An interface can then be written to mount the external
Mac file system, and move files around, since the Mac OS is almost all inside the
ROM.

        Of course, none of this is (or was in the case of CP/M) easy.

Subject: Badblocks program buggy?

Has anyone else noticed that badblocks (used by mke2fs) doesn't seem to
detect the first bad block in a contiguous block of bad blocks? I
found the bug in badblocks which meant it only found one bad block ever. That
was due to a misplaced 'continue' statement, if I remember.

Perhaps this is a gate-post error?
