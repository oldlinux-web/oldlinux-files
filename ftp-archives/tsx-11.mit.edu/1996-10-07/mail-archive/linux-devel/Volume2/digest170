Can anyone tell me how I can address it?

I have kernel 1.1.18, gcc 2.5.8, and libc.so.4.5.24.  (By the way
the Quickstart mentioned that I need lib.4.4.4.  Will libc.so.4.5.24

The problem with this is that most of these green computers need
assistance from the BIOS which isn't used very much under linux.
(I just upgraded my motherboard to one with the EPA logo).
I have also had some problems with the energy saving features
and Linux. I haven't had time to investigate all that much, but
it seems as if some options cause my Linux to hang without any
explanation; turning off the chipset's energy features fixed this.

One reason for wanting to turn off the hard disks is the noise.
I have put together a small machine which works as a server
for WFW and Linux. (The advantage is that I get long filenames
and permissions under Linux and better security when running
under DOS). I would also like to use this machine to phone up
my internet connection during night when the phone rates are lower,
and this brings me to the main problem. To do this, the machine has
to be on all the time, and since it's a collection of old hardware
(not much $$$), the disks are quite noisy (a bunch of old 20MB mac
disks, and since the computer lives in my bedroom, it can be quite 
hard to go to sleep. And that's why I want to be able to turn off 
my SCSI disks. (As an added bonus, the electricity bill will be lower. 
The monitor which is one of the most power hungry peripherals is 
usually turned off anyway).

BTW. I've got the SCSI disk restart working right now, so all I
need to fix now is the timeout code which turns off the disks.
Does anybody have any pointers of how to implement this. What
I need is some kind of array with "last-accesed-time" which should
be checked perioically to see if it's time to turn off a disk.
Is there a nice, simple and beautiful way to do this processing?
(There's a call "sys_alarm" in the kernel which seems to warrant 
further investigation.)

Well, that's my $0.02 for tonight.
Good night.

Subject: efficient M3 runtime for LINUX: RTHeapDepC.c?
Date: 13 Sep 1994 20:48:35 GMT


I'm working on enhancing the modula-3 port of LINUX to synchronize the
garbage collector heap with the virtual memory subsystem.

I started with linux 1.0.9 and the M3 binary distribution for LINUX
by Michel Dagenais <dagenais@vlsi.polymtl.ca> at:

        ftp://ftp.vlsi.polymtl.ca/pub/m3/linux/

I upgraded from linux 1.0.9 to 1.1.18 without incident -- for
unrelated reasons.

But even simple M3 programs like 'plaid' would stop to garbage
collect. I asked if this had something to do with the fact that VM =
FALSE in LINUX/RTHeapDep.i3, and Bill Kaslow said yes, that's exactly
the problem. He said that nobody has yet done the work to get the
memory protection stuff to work with the garbage collector under LINUX.

So I'm going to give it a try.

The first obstacle was that mprotect() is not included in the 1.1.18
version of the linux kernel. So I have upgraded to 1.1.45. The patches
supplied by Bruno Haible <haible@ma2s2.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de>
in <351kkg$g5n@nz12.rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>, when applied to the 1.1.45
source, would not build. So I assume that they are patches to an earlier
version of the kernel, and that the issue has been resolved by the 1.1.45
kernel.

        *** How can I test that mprotect() actually works? ***

I doubt that little 20-line C test programs will test it sufficiently.
Anyway...

Now I'm deep in the bowels of libm3/src/runtime/LINUX, trying to make
it look more like libm3/src/runtime/SPARC and/or
libm3/src/runtime/DS3100.

I thought the tricky part was going to be in RTHeapDep.m3, but I discovered
a whole new ball of wax in RTHeapDepC.c . The comments there
[thank god for the comments in the M3 code. How do the linux guys
get by without comments? Some form of telepathy that I'm not aware of?]
say:


/* This file implements wrappers for almost all LINUX 1.1.45 system calls
   that take pointers as arguments.  These wrappers allow the system
   calls to take arguments that might point to the traced heap, which
   may be VM-protected in the LINUX implementation of the collector.
   The wrappers read and write the referents of all pointers about to
   passed to the system call, which ensures that the pages are not
   protected when the call is made.

   Each wrapper is a critical section, with RTou__inCritical non-zero,
   so that another thread cannot cause the pages to become reprotected
   before the system call is performed.

   A few system calls are not handled here, or are handled only
   partially.  This restricts the system calls that can be made from
   Modula-3, or from libraries that are passed pointers into the
   Modula-3 traced heap.  These system calls are:
        ....
*/


The SPARC version of RTHeapDepC.c yields zillions of compile errors
on LINUX. gcc is picky, and you have to get this stuff right, I guess.

How did you come up with the list of syscalls that need wrappers?
How did you distinguish them from the ones like wait, wait3, ...?
   (Some calls in Section 2, including wait, wait3, sigvec,
   sigprocmask, and sigsuspend, are already wrappers for other system
   calls; it is not necessary to reimplement them here.)


Anyway... I suppose I can plot through most of this eventually, but
it looks tedous and error-prone.

I'm making slow progress, but any help would be appreciated.

Hi Christer,

  I don't think that software controlled energy saving features are really necessary
since more and more so called `green' computer (especially PC's) are sold. Their
`green' functions work at hardware level and mostly provide even more energy saving
features, e.g. for the screen.

Somebody else is working ona directory /proc/mtab, with subdirectories for

Subject: Login USERID length bug?
Date: 12 Sep 1994 23:37:42 GMT

I think there is a serious problem in connection with 'login'.

Login doesn't work correctly when the login ID is > 8
characters AND you telnet or type 'login' at a console
*after* having logged in.
It gives a 'login incorrect' response.  This doesn't happen
when you login directly from the console.

I've had the same problem with kernels, 1.0.8, 1.1.35, and
1.1.45.

I'd be very happy if someone could shed light on this problem
because it is very embarrasing to tell people that they have
to restrict their login ID's to 8 characters (it smells of
MSDOS :=( ).

Thanx

Maybe I'm just using an "old" version of login, but I've been unable
to reproduce any of the reported bugs with long login names.  I
regularly login with a nine-letter login name, and it works fine.  I
just tried the examples above, and they all work just fine. 

Ls -l `which login`  yields:

        -rws--x--x   1 root     root        24004 Dec 29  1992 /bin/login

The only problem I ever have is with some programs not reporting the
ninth letter of the login id.  "Ls" is such a program.

The problem with nvi (mine is ver 1.03) is, you can delete a line and put it

        "add
