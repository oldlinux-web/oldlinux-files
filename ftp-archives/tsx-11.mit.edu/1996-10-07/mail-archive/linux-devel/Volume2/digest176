The product was called Improv and got rave reviews as the "killer app"

into the mainstream (actually, he did a lot more wrong than just forget 
the floppy). Lotus wrote it, then, when it became apparent that the next

again got rave reviews in the press, but a lot of yawns from the business 
community. They recently announced that they are discontinuing 
development and will include Improv's features in upcoming (even more 
bloated) versions of 1-2-3. Maybe Lotus will port Improv to Linux, but I 
wouldn't hold my breath. It would be more likely for a shareware 
spreadsheet vendor to port their product to Linux, if they could be 
persuaded that there is a shareware market for Linux machines. 
Personally, I'd love to have "As Easy As 1-2-3" ported to Linux. Anybody 
know any shareware spreadsheet developers ?

Agreed. If we had any reasonably featured 1-2-3 compatible spreadsheet, 
there'd be a lot more Linux in the business community. I'd like to 
replace all the Windows for Workgroups s/w in our company with Linux, but 
the main reasons they use WFW is to telnet (no problem), and to run Lotus 
(big problem, they want wysiwyg, and it has to read their existing lotus 
files). Until then, I'm stuck with Bill Gates idea of a bad practical joke.

Are there any far reaching goals for Linux such that there is a point where
the kernel is _finished_?  Will development just continue until the kernel
suffers from severe featuritus?  

Just a point that I found interesting to cogitate over and was hoping would 
spark off an interesting discussion.

Why not have the kernel figure out the geometry itself?
If heads > 16 and <= 32, assume its doubled and halve it and double cylinders
If heads > 32 and <= 48, assume tripled,
and so on.

I.e. find n such that h > 16*(n-1) and h <= 16n, 
then multiply cylinders by n and divide heads by n.

Very little kernel code, and would make some people much happier.

I was wondering about the 5632 myself.
5632=4096+1536

1536 is a common mtu, I believe (could be wrong).

5632/512 = 11

It is not a programming error. In order for the netstat to its job, it
must translate the IP address to a name. To do this, it will call
gethostbyaddr(). Since your /etc/host.conf file says to look in the
'bind' library first, or if it was not in the /etc/hosts file, it will
ask the name server at caltec. This is not a fast operation over a
slip link.

It is quicker if you don't translate the names. To do this, use
'netstat -r -n' or 'route -n'.

If you plan to do a lot of name translations then you may wish to look
into setting up a 'cache only' name server. If you plan to do a lot of
names with one domain, setup a secondary server for that domain. A
secondary name server will do a zone transfer and will be
substantially faster for names in the domain.

Subject: Sound Problems with SW32
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 1994 18:42:39 GMT


I recently upgraded to v1.1.50 of the kernel from v1.0.7 and installed
the new Voxware sound driver v3.0 alpha.  I have an Orchid SoundWave 32
and configured the driver for Microsoft Sound System, Sound Blaster,
and MPU-401 support as follows:

MSS IRQ10, DMA0
SB IRQ7, DMA1
MIDI IRQ5

The IRQs and DMAs, I am *sure*, are correct.

The problem is that I am getting DMA timeouts whenever I try to do
anything with the MSS sound.  "tracker" plays the first 3 seconds of
a MOD over and over and over...  'cat sound.au > /dev/audio' results
in the playing of the sound and then either a) hanging (terminate
with a CTRL-C) or b) playing the sound and then piece(s) of *previous*
sounds played on /dev/audio.  DOOM's sound, and rplay also fail to
work properly with the driver/card.

I previously (in v1.0.7) had v2.4 (?) of the Sound Blaster driver
installed and also was getting DMA timeouts when trying to play
MOD files with tracker, but /dev/audio worked ok.

In addition, I don't think that card is being initialized properly
at boot-up because I have an audio-CD hooked up the the SW32 whos
signal is supposed to pass-through the sound card and out the line-out
so that you can listen to CDs and whatever while the card is active
playing MIDI or sound effects or what have you.. however, under
Linux, the audio-CD volume is extremely low (almost need to max
the volume on the stereo to hear the CD playing).  I also noticed that
sounds that do play with /dev/audio are muted compared to those
played under /dev/audio1 (SB emulation).

Any ideas?

Alan Cox (iialan@iifeak.swan.ac.uk) responds:
: It produces code about as fast or fractionally slower but much much smaller,
: and although its not a proper ANSI compiler so speed comparisons are not
: totally fair it compiles much quicker than gcc.

It should be noted that GCC 1.42 is still maintained. GCC 1.42 
produces smaller executables and compiles code faster than GCC 2.x.
The last version of GCC 1.x which I used under Linux was 1.39.
It might be interesting to compare GCC 1.42 with GCC 2.5.8 under
Linux.

I planned to build such a thing in the next months. I've not much spare time,

I always dreamed about controlling my PC with the remaining keys of my
video remote control... (:

The circuit I've in mind is build around a SFH505A as receiver (or a small
circuit built around a TDA3048 if the SFH is not available), an 87C750
singlechip microprocessor which decodes the RC signals and a MAX232 which
transfers the decoded signals to the serial port of a computer.
I think it is not a good idea to let the pc decode the signals, since your
oh-so-fast x86 should do other things but waiting in a busy loop for slow
serial data...
I will make the circuit diagram available as soon as it is ready, but it may
be difficult for most people to get an 87C750 programmed, though...

The NCR53c810 driver works after one (minor) bug is corrected,

in drivers/scsi/53c7,8xx.c.

The 32 bit ALU was introduced with the 68020. The former family members,
