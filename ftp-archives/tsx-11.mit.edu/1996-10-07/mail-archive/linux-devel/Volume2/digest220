(get info about mac hardware)

Two problems:  1)  Apple documentation is intended for programmers
writing for the Mac OS, or manufacturers adding additional hardware.
2)  There are a *lot* of variations.  Unlike the PC world,
standardization is in OS software, not hardware.

Example:  Hardware reference manual for IIsi says, in effect,
that 'the ADB ports are different from original Mac II, and
any software that talks to it directly probabally won't work.'  Not
explained is _how_ it's different.

        I have linux running on an AMI Atlas VIP motherboard with a 90MHz
Pentium.  I also have an ATI Graphics Pro Turbo (Mach64), NE2000 (Novell-
Mycrodyne), and a Sound Blaster 16 ASP.  It works great.

        I also have an Adaptec 2940 (Fast SCSI-2) controller card with
a Fast SCSI-2 hard drive.  Linux does NOT recognize it.  I have borrowed
my friends IDE hard drive temporarily.  I am hoping a driver will be out
soon.

Subject: The ELF/PIC performance measurement.
Date: 22 Sep 1994 21:52:27 GMT

I did an ELF/PIC performance measurement with gcc on a 486DX2/66 with
16MB RAM and no external cache.

1. Compiler A is gcc 2.6.0-940917 configured as i486-linuxelf and
   linked with the ELF/PIC version of the Linux C 4.6.10. The assembler
   is linked with the ELF/PIC version of the Linux C 4.6.10 as well as
   the ELF/PIC version of libbfd.

2. Compiler B is gcc 2.6.0-940917 configured as i486-linux and linked
   with the a.out/DLL version of the Linux C 4.6.10. The assembler
   is linked with the a.out/DLL version of the Linux C 4.6.10 only.

Compiler A and Compiler B use the same linker which is linked with the
ELF/PIC version of the Linux C 4.6.10 as well as the ELF/PIC version
of libbfd.

While compiling c-torture 1.29.1 which contains 634 testing cases,
simultaneously, the timing for compiler A is:

4631.12user 5497.17system 5:33:35elapsed 50%CPU(0avgtext+0avgdata0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps

The timing for compiler B is:

4740.34user 4963.42system 5:28:24elapsed 49%CPU(0avgtext+0avgdata0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Compiler A is less than 5% slower than compiler B. If that can hold for
other cases, which may well be true, I think we are in very good shape
with ELF/PIC.

If it's just // style comments you want, use the -lang-c-c++-comments
option to cpp, specified in the specs file like above.  That turns on
// handling only.

A while ago, I mentioned to the gcc2 list about the need for an
all-purpose way to pass arguments to the various compiler pass programs
from the gcc command line, but I don't believe such a feature can be
expected in 2.6.  :-(  So for now, we have to edit the specs file.

That's a problem when writing. On the other hand, the big-packet problem
shows up only when reading, so rsize=2048 and wsize=8192 should get us the
best of both worlds. Sort of.

Don't forget to replace the SIGALRM handling. (Right now the kernel
decrements the counters when it walks the process queue every timer tick.)

I already have (somewhat ugly) patches which do this (part of porting the
BSD scheduler to Linux). The run queues are done with standard queues; I
just wrote another routine which adds a new element at the end instead of
at the beginning so that the scheduler will do round-robin within a
priority class. New priorities are calculated every two seconds or so.

My question is whether pages swapped out, but left resident in the
swap space, are marked as such, so that they can be cleaned out if
more virtual memory is needed.  What I'm talking about is a kind of
compromise between the old and new systems....

: Only if Linux on the Alpha will be a 64-bit-OS. If it will be, I hope
: that they do not repeat the OSF/1 idiocy of having only 32-bit ints.

ints should be 32-bit, longs 64-bit and shorts 16-bit.

If both ints and longs were made 64-bit, one would have no access to
32-bit or 16-bit objects (depending on the size of a short). That would
break a lot of applications and cause headaches when dealing with file
formats.

I think that the OSF/1 solution (64-bit longs, 32-bit ints and 16-bit
shorts) is the best one; it seems to be intuitively logical (longs
should be long and may be longer than ints) and doesn't break much
(programs which depend on ints being 32-bit will still run).

Subject: Try this IPX bridging code ...
Date: Fri, 23 Sep 1994 04:32:40 GMT

I have uploaded IPX bridging code to sunsite (Incoming). This is 
pre-pre-alpha, but is precursor for fulfledged development of IPX 
bridging/routing on linux. At this stage, it *may* work for you.
And it is not all that efficient as of now. We mainly want feedbacks and
design ideas for efficiency. 

Here is the README:
================================
This is first  attempt to get IPX bridging and routing working
for linux.

This is pre-pre-alpha. This implementation is just to trigger off 
the full fledged development. 

ASSUMPTIONS:
  1. Bridges between only two interfaces : eth0 and eth1. (Hardcoded)
  2. The MTUs of both interfaces should remain equal.

TODO:

IPX bridging:

1. Intelligent bridging
2. Get most functionality into the kernel to minimise overheads 
   (in the style of routing)

IPX routing: 

We are trying to port Mark Bush's <Mark.Bush@comlab.ox.ac.uk>
IPXrouted.tar.gz   to linux. This package is IPX routed implementation
for SUNs. It is available in ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk archives.

It handles IPX packets all by itself, without requiring any kernel support
from the sun system (i.e. it reads all packets from /dev/nit interface).
Hence, this package cannot make use of IPX sockets which are currently
in the kernel. We will try to eventually adapt this package to make
use of IPX sockets which are currently in the kernel.


Note
=====
We are  still learning... All kinds of suggestions  are welcome.
Are we doing some silly mistakes in network programming?
And allow us to take our own time!

I don't really know which problems you folks have. I have been 
operating a DEC DSP3160S (1.6 G) with a Adaptec 1542B since 0.99.9
and never had any problems. No Extended Translation, nothing. Remember:
All DOS-specific extensions as Extended Translation have to be switched OFF.

The one and only problem you may encounter is that you cannot boot a 
file which resides above the 1 G limit because this is handled by the
BIOS which cannot access > 1023 cyls. Just keep your /vmlinuz'es below
and you should have no problems.

Linus introduced 64 bit pointers recently.

: >64 bits = long

: Another observation: at least according to the K&R C specification, short
: int, int, and long int are not defined to be any specific bit length, and
: can all be equal to same bit length, as a matter of fact.  The programmer
: who writes expecting short int = 16 bits should know that the code will not
: necessarily be portable.

: Therefore, there shouldn't be a problem defining

: short int = 32 bits
: int       = 64 bits
: long int  = 64 bits

: or all of them = 64 bits.  This makes more sense to me than int = 32 bits.

Obviously you do not need to read files in binary formats much, or at
least not binary formats designed for older platforms. 16-bit quantities
are invaluable when dealing with file formats designed for MS-DOS
applications.

8 bits = char
16 bits = wchar_t, short

64 bits = long

Why break that which is not broken, especially for such a trivial
reason? Unicode and other 16-bit encodings already have wchar_t, and
they are not going to replace ASCII in the near future.

What is "natural"? An Alpha can handle 32-bit quantities just as
"naturally" as 64-bit quantities, so it all comes down to convenience.
And dropping one size, thus making it unavailable to programmers, is
very inconvenient.

Let's not fool ourselves. Some people say that that is a Good Thing as
it breaks poorly written applications and teaches Good Programming. This
is tantamount to asserting that self-flagellation is character-building.
In other words, it has more to do with masochism than with making a
usable system. Programming environments should not be about obstacles
for the sake of obstacles.

Just my $0.02;

Since the converse ( "sizeof(int)==sizeof(void *)" ) is not specified in
the C specification, it should not be assumed. It is a pretty safe
assumption, however, that a long can hold both a pointer and an int.
