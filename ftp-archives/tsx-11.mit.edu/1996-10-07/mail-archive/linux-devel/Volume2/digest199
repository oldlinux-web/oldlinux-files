Subject: Linux Floptical Disk Driver?
Date: 20 Sep 1994 11:24:39 GMT

Hi,
a few days ago my 3.5" FDD died, so if have to buy a new one.
My thought was why not a Floptical Disk Drive?

As I know, the were produced by IOMEGA. These drives can read
standard 3.5" 720k, 1.44M, 2.88M disks and the Floptical format 
of about 21 MB.
The r/w head is controlled by a laser beam, I think.

I think these drives are a good compromize between the standard 
FDDs which we need for compatibility reasons and an improvement 
of disk space. Of course, a MO-Drive has a even higher storage 
capacity (128MB), but you can't read standard disks. 

Have anyone out there any informations or experiences about these 
drives? Are they suported by Linux or have a device driver to be 
developed? do they require a special controller?

Regards,
         Oliver.

True, it happens here as well (1.1.51), but only one time after a reboot...
(I did only a mount, ls, umount and it faulted in _floppy_release)

What I expressed in my article was not my opinion (although it is similar),
but the way things are regulated over here and in many other countries.
(at least in Europe)

A true HAM won't agree with that!
There are a lot of things in radio that are not fully understood, especially
in the area of propagation.  And there is a lot still to experiment, e.g.
when you want to have a better receiver than those Japanese boxes you find
on the shelf of your HAM-radio dealer...

This has nothing to do with using the Amateur radio bands for the purpose.
In fact, it can be clearly shown that there is not enough allocation for
any serious wide-use of high-speed network, and it needs to be solved
using cable/fiber technology.

That is a nice opinion, but the commercial providers will not be happy
to abide it.
You know, the business plan of telecom providers is to "maximize the profit",
and they will not like the idea of a "competitor" that does not have a
cost factor that they do.

In Europe *there already exists* a packet backbone on 1.2 GHz.  I can tell
you that it requires a lot of planning to get allocations that are not used
by the commercial guys, and even then we see ATC RADAR or Wind Profilers
appear on our frequencies.  It just shows ignorance to claim that
"spectrum above 1 GHz isn't used really".
Remember that all this spectrum is only available to us on a secondary
basis, and there are others who are secondary as well or even primary.
I.e. we must accept intererence from them, or we may not even cause interference
to them.
This is not a problem when running SHF-DX on these bands, but I can tell
you it becomes a problem once you start to use the bands for permanent
links.

Once again, you may have this opinion but it is not in line with the
definition of amateur radio by the authorities.

Also there is still another problem with the packet backbone: there
are too many free-riders.  People that think that by getting an amateur
radio license they are automatically entitled to have and use a perfect
packet radio network, without helping to build or fund it.
This is the factor that prevents expansion and improvement right now.
(lack of funds, and lack of people that want to invest spare time into
improving and expanding the network)
I think that by allowing the use as a "free internet" and advertising
such use, the situation will only become worse.
Remember that a lot of the network is *hardware*, and that it does not
come for free.

Which explains why all the machine code instructions on Alpha are 32
bits :-)

Before posting nonsense, please check your facts. Alpha supports both
32 and 64 bit memory access. It doesn't support byte access, however.

once I broke something similar on a SUN.

I still think it is better to go for a program-generated signature which
is (by convention) stored as the first member of every kernel data structure,
and which is guaranteed to change whenever something is changed in the
structure. (it could, for example, be generated from compiler debug info)

This provides a safe check for everyone who wants to check, not only
modules.  I.e. any kernel routine can check if there is really a
valid "struct xx" at the "struct xx *p" it is manipulating.

Something like this was done in the new serial routines, but it uses
manually-generated signatures.  Automatic ones would have the advantage
of guaranteed, non-ambiguous change.  (even in the presence of multiple
patches to the same datastructure)

The disadvantage can be that sometimes a module is declared incompatible
because of a change unimportant to that module...

Are you sure about this?  In my experience, on 64 bit architectures
(like MIPS R4x00, IBM POWER, Alpha, etc) using 32 bit quantities is
often significantly faster than going with the full 64 bits, probably
due to better cache utilization.

I would go the dip route.  It provides SLIP which is, in my experience, a bit
more stable than ppp in the later kernels.  This will work only if your 
Internet Service Provider allows slip connections.  Menuing is handled by some
funky DOS client ( :) ).  Using your system as just another node on the 'net

Subject: 1.1.51 Adaptec 1542 SCSI problems
Date: 19 Sep 1994 08:40:54 GMT


I just tried compiling 1.1.51 for my computer.  There was no problem
compiling, but when I tried using my system, the SCSI subsystem 
became unstable, causing lots of "interrupt received, but no mail"
messages, with other messages regarding problems with
delay timeouts, etc.  None of these problems occured with 1.1.50,
so I'm guessing that there is a problem in 1.1.51.  

Of course, I've only had the SCSI adaptor for a week now, so 
I don't have a lot of experience with this.  But 1.1.50 worked
great, 1.1.51 locks up.

A downgrade to 1.1.50 solved my problems.

Anyone else having problems?

Well, if you list all those, you should not omit mgetty+sendfax, which is
very well suited for LOTS of incoming traffic, and moderate to medium
outgoing traffic.

BUT: mgetty+sendfax is not meant to be used as a network fax sender, that
is, there is no remote spooling mechanism (yet). But then, Efax doesn't
have one either...

Why not simply using Proxy ARP on the SLIP server? Sounds a lot easier +
