True.  But you'll note I didn't say anything about where those 2 addresses
need to reside.  Common sense would seem to suggest putting your
"router's" PPP port on your host's net, and it's ether on your own, and in
fact, this works.  At worst, external incoming connections will get aimed
at your ether IP number, but you don'e lost a _whole_ there...

I've had problems putting the boot partition above 1G because the BIOS

Don't confuse the filesize limit with the filesystem size limit. There
are real problems handling an individual file > 2GB (at least on a 32
bit machine), but having a filesystem up to 4*10^9 sectors is a much
easier problem. Most systems haven't given up on the idea that the
limits should be the same, but that's muddy thinking.

Note that the easiest jump is to 4GB (32 bits) since disk location is
(or can be) an unsigned number inside the kernel, while the UNIX system
calls use a signed number and you only get 31 bits for the actual
offset.

After that you can work in sectors, or allocation units. The first looks
a lot easier than the second in terms of not having to do a lot of
arithmetic in software.

This is important, 2GB won't hold a week's news, but 4GB will, probably
until the end of '95 ;-(

I have a BIG  problem with a USENET private club (which this basicly is.)  
Most moderated groups allow EVERYOEN to post, and a moderator or 
moderators sift through it to find what useful and what is fluff.

This way it doesn't devolve into cliches.

Howdy folks!

I'm looking for some help with an *ugly* bug or two.  I've recently been
working to port a fairly large application that was developed under HP-UX
and uses Tcl7.3 so that it would work with Dist-3.0 and metaconfig to
compile all over the place (metaconfig is the system Perl and Trn use
to configure themselves).  As I said my application was developed under
HP-UX, but my porting work has been on a Linux system at home.

I'm running Slackware-2.0 with the 1.1.18 kernel (but I've tried the 1.0.9
and 1.1.50 kernels with the same results).  My application has two Tcl
interpreters, which it creates fine, but the first Tcl code which I
attempt to evaluate contains a variable dereference.  This line causes
the program to Seg-fault __INSIDE_TCL__  the seg fault is in Tcl_ParseVar
and at the point where the Tcl parser is just beginning to parse the part
of the string which follows the variable reference.  To make matters worse,
I get the seg fault when I run from the commandline or when I run from
the debugger, but it does *not* occur if I run from the debugger and single
step through the program.  Oh, it also occurs exactly the same whether
I compile with or without optimization.

All of this happened using Tcl binaries and share libraries supplied with
Slackware 2.0.  Being a little suspicious, I downloaded the latest Tcl7.3
modified for Linux shared libs from sunsite but to no avail (either using
the supplied shared libs or compiling myself from the Linux-modified 
sources).

Now here's where it really gets weird:  I downloaded a stock copy of Tcl7.3
from sprite and compiled it.  The compile went fine, but it fails the
expr test with a floating point exception.  This same test is passed with
flying colors by the linux-modified version of tcl, but comes up every
time with the stock tcl.  The mystery is further depened by the fact that
stock tcl and the linux modified tcl do not differ in any source file--only
in the Makefiles.

Oh, and of course, the stock Tcl still exhibits the seg fault problem
I mentioned above.

ARRRGGGGG.  What could I be doing wrong?

I recently built a system for someone with an Intel Plato P54C
motherboard which used the Neptune chipset.  I used an NCR SCSI
controler with a patched kernel (version 1.1.19).  The first
motherboard I got had a flakey cache, and upgrading the BIOS didn't
help.  I replaced the motherboard, and everything has worked
flawlessly since.

Commercial unix systems usually include optimized support for a limited
number of disk devices, and make use of knowledge of the physical 
characteristics in optimizing system throughput.  

For example, i/o requests can be reordered on the fly based
on the known current rotational position of the spindle,
rather than just waiting for it to come around again..

Knowledge of the true physical geometry of the disk lends itself
to further optimizations, such as organizing data by cylinder
rather than by arbitrary sequential block numbers (close, but not
the same results).  To do a good job of this requires further knowledge
of the sector count/location on each track of the disk.. a complex
task when variable sectors/track are used.

Varying the locations of sector/block 0 on each track can yield impressive
throughput figures, by taking into account the head movement/settling times
from one track/cylinder to the next, such that the next sequential block
is just appearing under the heads as the seek completes..

Lots of nice tricks, most of which require greater internal knowledge of
a restricted subset of available drives.. 

Linux, (un?)fortunately, likes to provide more generic drive support.

Sure - the NCR53c406a is a more integrated version of the NCR53c90,
very similar to what NCR did with the NCR53c400 which was based on the

I haven't used or even dl'd userfs, but I'm confused about this
part. First, why is it necessary to have multiple concurrent accesses
to the same site? Couldn't the interface to ftpfs be a queue of
{localdir, remotedir/file}? Having multiple accesses will not be any
faster than this, and would not be necessary. 

Also, I've used many sites with simultaneous anonymous logins, to
concurrently download several files. It worked just fine. So, unless
ftpfs restricts this, what's the problem with it?

: Anyone else looked into or using ftpfs?  Can any sysops estimate just

I've just come across this today, but I'd thought about a similar
thing some time ago. Again, I haven't looked at userfs yet (I'll get
to it as soon as an idle cycle comes up), but here are some other
things that'd be interesting to see:

- Automatic mirroring of directories (and maybe index files) at
specified sites. That way, you can see the directory immediately (and
the index file, too), and it is always kept up to date (say, once per
day). When you try to access any of the files, then it is dnloaded via
ftp. This would also provide a mechanism to mark entries in the cache
as 'dirty' based on the new directory info.

These updates could be done on a strictly periodic basis, or the
program could "learn" how often updates needed to be done based on how
often it found updates at the site. Some sites (such as sunsite,
oakland, cica, etc) are updated very frequently, whereas many others
are only updated weekly, monthly, or even quarterly. In fact, you
could extend this algorithm to include directories at each site, since
changes probably tend to be centered on a few directories at a time
(eg, the OS/2 sites probably receive few updates to the 1.x
directories, but quite a few to 2.x and 2.1).

- ftpfs should understand the concept of mirrors, and allow (at the
minimum) the ability to define redundant sites. If it can't get on at
one, it tries the others, until one is open. A priority should be
assigned to let you pick the fastest, or closest, one first. ftpfs
could also dynamically re-assign this priority based on how well the
sites work, so that it will eventually pick the best one by itself.

I'd be interested in your comments on these ideas. I won't have time
for a little while to work on these types of changes (due to other
projects), but I'd love to help when I get the time.

Minix won't fix the problem, too. Since that Minix format used by Linux/68 originated
in another operating system which is called "Minix" (how surprising...) one can
definately say that this is not a bug!

There shouldn't be any real problem in creating a ext2fs code portable to
an other endianess. You could try to make the code recognize some magic
values of ext2fs so user won't even have to know about byte sex of filesystems
on media.

|> There may also be the issue that the 680x0 project is using ext2-fs0.4.

No, Linux/68k uses version 0.5a. In general you can say that the kernel code is
mostly equivalent to Linux/i386 version 1.0.9.

|> Any ideas on how to fix this mess?  Thanks.

I've discussed the problem with someone some time ago. He said "that's why god
made tar". That's another point of view...

This negative number error messages result from some necessary changes in
/usr/include/linux/unistd.h which have broken all code which has linked
with libc/libm version 4.5.21 or earlier. Furthermore shared libraries
with that version number must be replaced.

You should try to install binaries from tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/680x0/bin/,
which have been build using the most recent versions of the libraries via the
RAMdisk onto your harddisk(s). After reboot everything should be ok.

The Linux/68k installation is a horrible thing, but wait for version 1.0...

With correct gcc setup for either AmigaDOS the kernel builds just like on
Linux/i386. And running Linux/68k you won't see any difference when building
the kernels.

Network stuff (inet) has been portet to Linux/68k just some days ago and is still
pretty untested.

Write a driver for that card. You might base your work on the NetBSD driver. Or
use the Golden Gate passive bridge board. This would make porting drivers for
almost all PC cards without DMA a children game.

The FAQ won't tell you very much about Linux/68k. But if you're interested, subscribe the 680x0 channel of the Linux mailing list. A newsgroup names maus.os.linux68k exists (languages both german and english), but isn't spread very far. You might however try to read it via the newsserver news.uni-stuttgart.de. No postings, sorry...
