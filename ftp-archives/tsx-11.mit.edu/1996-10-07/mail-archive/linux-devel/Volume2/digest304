Well.  Almost.  A multifork file would be something like a directory
with a "default" file: If you only specify the directory file name,
you will get the MAIN fork instead ...

I'm trying to figure out whether or not the Adaptec AHA-2940 PCI scsi
controller is going to be supported under linux anytime soon...

I asked about a week ago and I've read the back articles on this thread but
there isn't a decent answer amongst them.  Some posts say Adaptec won't
release the product info. one post points me to the Project-Map which
doesn't mention *anything* about *any* adaptec projects (thanks to who ever
that was, real helpful...)

There have been lots of people like myself asking this question so could
somebody who *knows* the answer please tell me if somebody is currently
working on a device driver for the AHA-2940??  If somebody is working on it
how is the progress going? if somebody isn't working on it, why not?

Thanks for any info you can give me,

It does. I have made the following change to file
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.8/specs

*cpp:
%{!m386:-D__i486__} %{posix:-D_POSIX_SOURCE} %{c++-comments:-lang-c-c++-comments}

I can't believe you want someone outside of australia for the work,
but if you do, continue reading.

I've been hacking Linux for about a month and am cutting my
teeth on Linux drivers by extending the alpha level Token Ring
driver.  I have 30+ years of very broad experience in the
computing field with activities ranging from adding device
support to IBM OS/MFT to programming device driver level code
on IBM PC platforms.  My experience includes 7 years leading the
project teams porting IBM mainframe FORTRAN compilers to AIX/ESA
et al.

If you happen to still be interested, I require:
   1)  Your assurance that the data rates you require can be
       achieved in the DOS environment using the C driver
   2)  $125 per hour (assuming a minimum contract period of
       about a month and minimal difficulties negotiating
       the agreement, regular payment for effort and/or
       pre-payment, etc.)
   3)  In addition to card, etc. for testing, suitable data
       generaters with appropriate mechanisms for verification
       of correctness would be required
   4)  Complete documentation on the hardware, etc. probably
       including access to the DOS driver code
before I would consider providing an estimate you might want
to hold me to.  I would be willing to spend a small amount
of uncompensated time studying the harware documentation, etc.,
but if you want a fixed price bid, that can only be as a followup
to a study phase compensated on an hourly basis.  The only 
thing I can provide w/o compensation is a set of approximate costs.

Should you still be interested, any contract would be with my
company and might include work performed by my associates who
though well qualifed with extentsive experience with device
driver level code on PC hardware do not have unix or linux
experience.

It can certainly create a lot of extra work when a drive crashes.  Even as I write this my colleagues are busy restoring humongus amounts of data because, for the second time in as many months, a drive died on our HP-9000.  I guess they're getting tired of the all-nighters because this time they built each filesystem on separate spindles instead of striping them across 3 spindles.  Another fun aspect of LVM's is trying to maintain an accurate map of logical to physical volumes.  In other words, don't bother writing an LVM for Linux on my account.  What would be useful is a means to resize, both grow and shrink a partition without destoying the contents.

We have similar problems with machines equiped with NE2000 cards.
They boot OK after a hardreset or powerdown but not after a softreset.
(Some MORE machines with NE2000 cards got this symptom with 1.1.53 ...)
We've been using linux for more then 2 years and the severity of this
problem has varied.  Judging by Beckers comments in the source code and
on the net, the NE2000-clones are pretty hard to autodetect properly.

We recently had to switch from a NE2000 to a 3C509 in a P90 box
in order to get it stable in conjunction with heavy disk and net activity.
Some NE2000 clones seems to be crappy ...

I've been trying to find out what caused this pentium optimizer to crash,

I suspect the problem comes from an interaction between the optimisations

I agree, because either you're going to slow down all file allocation
in seeking out and destroying these 'temporary' files when necessary,
or you're going to end up having some kind of daemon to basically do this
anyway.

Neither read nor write activity does normally have a relation to the
number of errors on a disk, since heads never touch the disk surface
during normal operation.

Is is normal that sometimes a new bad bad block appears on a hard disk.
Especially on SCSI disks it is easy to map them out. But if the number
of bad blocks increases strongly in a short period of time, you really
should exchange your harddisk against a new one. Since most harddisks
have very long warranty this is even free in most situations.

I've recently made some experiences with about the same situation. Result:

You could take care of the other side's ftp and background type 
processes from hogging the link by only offering a tiny TCP window when 
turnaround time gets too high. Yeah, it can hurt throughput, but 
interactive performance is more important. E.g. it is better to have 
an ftp take 10 minutes and your link be comfortable than to have the ftp 
take 5 minutes during which you tear out your hair because the link is 
sucking mud.

Hmm, think something might have gone wrong with your benchmarks... (the

1) Before I get flamed I am *NOT* posting this as a childish 'my machine

Ok, the bechmarks were run on a P90-512k cache 16Meg PCI micronics mb 
conner 540M EIDE hd running kernel version 1.1.53. Both the kernel and 
the benchmarks were compiled using the pentium gcc with as much 
optimisation as possible. (nb. if anyone is interested i will post the 
benchmarks for 486 optimised code to show the gain in using the pentium 
gcc, in fact surpisingly little).

ok, first off, obviously most of the tests are faster by ~2 times... 
(would have expected slightly more... but thats benchmarks for you :)
the sole reason I'm posting this is to draw your attention to the Shell 
scripts 2,4,8... a factor of 2 is to be expected... but there is *NO* way 
my machine is 80 times faster than yours... I really think something 
might have gone astray there. Just that if you are spending time 
comparing kernel speeds (a task I don't envy after only running the 
benchmark 3/4 times) then it might be wise to look into this.

Outdated? Why? In all 25 years of Unix's existance there have been
other operating systems (in fact I think the majority of them) that do
not treat files as a plain byte-stream, but that bloat the kernel with
all kinds of knowledge of the internals of the file.

Unix's idea of plain byte-streams has been very successful and
provides a lot of flexibility because assumptions on the contents of
files are put into user space. I see no recent developments whatsoever
that have changed such needs and have outdated this paradigm.
