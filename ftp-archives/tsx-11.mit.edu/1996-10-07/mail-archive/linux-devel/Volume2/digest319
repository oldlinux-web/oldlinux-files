This doesn't really belong in col.development, but anyway..  I
just noticed that the latest version of "dflat", a CUA compliant
toolkit for text screens (in other words, Motif and MS-windows
like) package had been uploaded to one of the main PC archiive
sites.

I remember from reading about it in Dr. Dobbs that it's supposed to
be somewhat portable.  So you might want to take a look at it.

(I haven't used it, but I might have a look at it some time...)

No, but I would like to have Linux on the Mac.  Macs are, believe it or
not, quite capable machines.  In fact, they are more capable than PCs in
most areas.  The only real weakness of Macs is the lack of software.
You have a choice of three or four wordprocessors, versus maybe 30 for
the PC.  So what?  It does what I need and more, and for less money than
a comparable PC.  So cope.

In theory I agree.  I suspect, though, one of the problems is that gnu C 
outdates the ANSI specification.  there are a rgeat many existing 
programs written sp[ecificly FOR gnu C.  it woudl be pretty nasty if they 
all (or a large subset even) stopped compiling without a special flag.

It works pretty well actually! I've got 40 PCs NFS mounting their D: and 
E: drives from a Linux host. They are all console-less industrial PCs 
running tests on computer peripherals. The network traffic is impressive 
in volume and so far no burps or hiccups from the Linux host. 

Just make the appropriate entries in a /etc/exports file (see man 
exports), make sure that portmapper, nfsd amd mountd are running. you may 
want to make pcnfsd or bwnfsd run if you want some kind of authentication 
from the PCs. I used the Tsoft NFS client for DOS on the PC side of things.

We're not talking about a real segmented address space here (or at
least, I'm not), just using a segment register as a base address.
Every address in the library's FS-relative local data space has an
alias in the DS-relative process address space.  Whenever the address
of a lib data object is taken, you generate it's address in global
DS-relative space.  This way all of the code is consistent in
dereferencing any pointers via DS.

This would not be a problem because every pointer generated is
DS-relative, even though it may be accessed via FS sometimes by the
library.

(For the record, even though I understand how it would function, I
personally think this segment thing is too much work, especially
considering the work making GCC to FS-relative addressing of library
data.  I prefer PIC or load-and-relocate solutions, which would even
be portable to non-segmented architectures.)

Why?  16-bit DOS is nothing like Multics so you can't judge Multic's
by your experience in DOS.  Also, the biggest problem with DOS on the
Intel's was that the segments were so small, wrapped-around, and there
was little or no fault detection.  Segmentation itself isn't bad at all.

Actually, I'd love to see Multics (or something close) that I could
play with.  I always wanted to get a chance to learn/use Multics but
now I guess that won't ever happen.

Yes. Rip out the code that writes to the screen and use [n]curses instead.
That'll be a bit slower, but at least it works best.

Alternately, allocate your own buffer and periodically update the changed
areas using curses (this is a bit faster). Alternately, implement VC
switching (look at the svgalib sources on how to do that); this is fastest
but works only on the console.

IMHO, programs which can only run on the console are next to useless.
In my case, this is because the console sits in the computer room
downstairs, and when I want to do real work, I use X. The display machine
is much quieter...

:Al Longyear           longyear@netcom.com

    There is nothing wrong with running X over a SLIP link.  X uses a TCP
    connection, therefore it will be error-checked and work just fine.
    Of course, it will be S.L.O.W., but it *will* work, I do it all the
    time.

    As far as flow control for sessions go, you generally want to set your
    mtu to 576 for a high speed modem running SLIP.  That gives you
    512 bytes of data per TCP packet maximum, but this alone will NOT
    effect the amount of buffering the computer tries to do.

    Linux, by default, will allow the other end to buffer around 32K I think, 
    which will reduce interactive response to a crawl.

    In order to fool around with buffering you need to set the TCP window
    size.  For example, if you set the TCP receiver window to 2K, then you
    are basically allowing the remote to queue 4 packets (mtu 576) to you 
    before getting an ack from the first.  Judicious settings will allow 
    you to run FTP and other batches at nearly full speed without impacting 
    on interactive response too badly.  The 1.1.X kernels have this ability 
    via the 1.1.X route command (and support built into the kernel routing 
    tables, of course).  You are on your own though, please remember that 
    the 1.1.X kernels are considered alpha-test kernels and are not for 
    general consumption.

:>Huh??? You need link-level checksums when you already have TCP and UDP

    modem

    error correction with or without compression:

        * reliable connection (no garbage characters)
        * END TO END HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL
        * higher latency (about 20ms round trip)

    error correction turned off:

        * random garbage will occur, making the link less reliable
        * ONLY LOCAL HARDWARE FLOW CONTROL, NOT END TO END
        * lower latency

    Basically, you want to use error correction because noise and garbage
    is a fact of life on any high speed modem with error correction 
    disabled and it only takes one noisy packet out of 20 to cut your TCP
    throughput for an upload or download in half.

Subject: More floppy bugs! 1.1.54 kernel
Date: Sun, 16 Oct 94 20:47:44 GMT

There are still some bugs in the floppy driver.

Here is what happens after I take a floppy, run mkswap on it, remove,
reinsert it, and then try to swapon /dev/fd0H1440:

664: 13:35:55: /: whitney# swapon /dev/fd0H1440
floppy0: disk absent or changed during operation
floppy I/O error
dev 021C, sector 0
Unable to find swap-space signature
swapon: /dev/fd0H1440: Invalid argument

Okay, lets try it again:

floppy0: disk absent or changed during operation
floppy I/O error
dev 021C, sector 0
Unable to find swap-space signature
swapon: /dev/fd0H1440: Invalid argument

Not any better. Lets try reading from /dev/fd0 a little:

666: 13:40:40: /: whitney# dd bs=1024 count=1 if=/dev/fd0H1440
of=/dev/null
VFS: Disk change detected on device 2/28
1+0 records in
1+0 records out

Ah, good. Try the swapon again:

667: 13:41:19: /: whitney# swapon /dev/fd0H1440
floppy0: bh=null in copy buffer before copy
floppy0: weirdness: remaining 8
Unable to find swap-space signature
swapon: /dev/fd0H1440: Invalid argument

Well, at least it thinks the disk is there and not removed during the
operation (it was the whole time!). Maybe someone is not resetting the
changed_floppies flags all the times it is needed. The dd took care of
that.

However, the bh=null and weirdness messages are disturbing, as is the
fact that it can't find the swap space signature (just what is it
reading off the floppy??)

I hope this helps find some bugs in the floppy driver.

P.S:    Yes, I know swapping to a floppy is weird, and of limited
usefulness, but there are some uncommon situations where it could be
useful and it shows some low-level driver bugs quite well, including
some which could be messing up my raw devices patch when I make it not
use 1k reads to the floppy. In any event, one should not get complaints
that the floppy is absent/changed during operation or weird messages
about "bh=null" and "weirdness: remaining 8". I am glad people are
doing work on the driver, but it is not ready for prime-time
(i.e. 1.2.0) quite yet.

P.P.S: A use for swap to a floppy. Installation on very memory
starved machines, before any partitions have been set up. Swap to the
floppy could get it running until one is ready to do that (albeit
quite slowly, but better than nothing at all, or borrowing SIMMS for
the install).

Reply-To: DUVAL@ELPP1.EPFL.CH


Hello world,
        I am trying to put a few Pcs with Linux up and have managed to get
the Dec Keyboards with the VT220 keys which leaves me the problem of getting
Linux to recognise the extra keys. With loadkeys I have menaged to get the
extra keys mapped and with showkey found the codes I need to be 113 114 115
116 117 and 118. 
        When I launch X, at the moment only V2.1.1, and have a look with xev,
these keys produce NO code, or translation whatsoever. This can not be
normal !!
        Could somebody tell me what has happened to these key codes in launching X ?
Do I have to get the sources of XFree and have a look at wher ethe codes are translated. I have read the keyboard FAQ which implies that X reads the
normal configurtion during its boot, and that the numbers of the keycodes assigned to the keys in X is "rather arbitrary"


What gives ???

( at the same time if anybody knows how to make the delete key function
correctly with Dec Motif, I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY )
