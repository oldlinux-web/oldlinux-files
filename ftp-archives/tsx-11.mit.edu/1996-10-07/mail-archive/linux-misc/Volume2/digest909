I could see how this might happen in some cases, but in my particular
one, the disk has been partitioned and formatted for several years. I 
was attempting to install Yggdrasil into a partition where Slackware had
been running for a year or so. Currently, there are OS/2, DOS/Windows
and, until I started playing with Yggdrasil, Slackware installed on the
disk and none of them have had any problem with its formatting.

It certainly looks like the problem is a bug with the Yggdrasil fdisk.

After my post about this, it occurred to me that the problem may also
have to do with either 1) a virus in the master boot record or 2) an
anti-viral (a benign virus? :-) program in the boot record. Both would
change the format of the boot record such that it didn't match a
normal one.

I don't think there is a virus in my boot record, but several months ago
I installed Norton Desktop for Windows in my DOS partition. This package
has an anti-viral program that _does_ do some mucking around with the 
master boot record. I think this is so it can get control very early and
try to detect and foil boot record viruses in the partitions. Maybe this
is confusing things?

That is an aweful suggestion.  If you want to run WordPerfect, then **RUN

The Unix version of WordPerfect 5.1 includes both a GUI/X version AND
a text based version.  Use either or both, or both at the same time, or
run the text based in an xterm, or in a console window, or on a serial
terminal, or over a modem, or multiuser,  or the X version on a remote
machine, or an Xterminal, or ,or    or      (isn't Unix software neat)

There are many, many others..... add Island Write/Draw/Paint, SCO

These should also work, but I haven't tested them yet-

ClockWise, Foxbase+, FoxPro, Dbase, Applixware,  Grammatik

Pardon, but I don't think this is correct.  Most 2 wire modems multiplex
the bandwidth and *do* allow simultaneous bi-directional data flow.  You
may be thinking of some data protocols that require packets to be
acknowledged by the receiving end before sending additonal ones, but this
has nothing really to do with what is flowing on the line itself.  I
haven't seen real 'line-turn around' modems since dealing with some
ancient Burroughs stuff nearly 20 years ago.  And even then the more
common 300 bps 2 wire modems *most* people were using were bi-directional,
using 4 tones, 1 pair to code 1's and 0's going one way, and the other
pair for data going the other.

Subject: GNU libc extensions (readline) - How to link?
Date: 8 Oct 1994 06:39:35 GMT

I decided to write some C code using the GNU libc extension, readline.          
But when I compile (even with -lgcc as the last arg on cmd-line):               
poly-render.c:75 (/tmp/cca004401.o): Undefined symbol _getline                  
 referenced text segment                                                        
So I tried "cd /usr/lib; nm lib* | grep readline" and it wasn't there.          
It would seem readline (and other GNU libc extensions) aren't in the            
standard shared libs?  I have Slackware 1.2.1 - soon to be upgraded,            
but that's where my D series came from - 1.1.51 kernel and sundry other         
upgrades too :)save                                                             
 
Is there a way to include the symbol without linking?  I was able to            
create a .o file without difficulty.  It wasn't in the GCC-FAQ, so              
I ask :)

If you plan to use Xwindow, get the slower machine with 16meg ram.  If you 
are happy with text mode, and don't plan to do anything memory intensive,
you'll probably be happier with 8meg.

I have a 486.33 with 8 meg ram, I write software as a hobby, and compiling
while in Xwindow is far too slow to be usable, so I stick with text mode, and
have no problems with slowdown while compiling.

   While I'm mentioning, is there any real advantage to getting a system 
   from Dell, or Gateway or some there "Name Brand" as aposed to a system 
   that will cost a LOT LESS from a no name copany like Cybermax, or 
   Profesional Somthing or another?

In my opinion, Dell and Zeos charge far too much for what they offer, I am
typing this on a Gateway 486.33, I'm happy with their machine (cept for the
15" CrystalSCan 1572FS monitor, made by Mag, which is dying) and the price
I paid for it.

Be happy...

I don't use X so I can't comments on that, but more and aporpos work fine 
for me in colsole mode.  I know the 'it works on my machine' isn't a

Did you follow the erratta and install usrbin first from the command line

Hmm. I found a quality improvement myself (better command line based

Maybe we have differnt experiences because we use the product diffrently...

Be sure to build your kernel from a clean and well-configured source tree.
In order to do that your best bet is to untar (or copy) a fresh source tree
from your CD. Then run "make config;make dep;make clean;make zImage" in the
top directory and everything should go fine.

For further enlightenment about kernel compiling, you should have a look at
the kernel sources' README.
