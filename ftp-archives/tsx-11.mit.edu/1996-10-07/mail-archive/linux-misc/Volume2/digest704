FWIW, I get the same error, although mine is "b:", since that's my
3.5" floppy.  The disk I was trying to read is a few years old, so
I wasn't sure if it was an 800k or a 1.44M disk.  I thought the latter,
but assumed it must have been the former when it didn't work.  Perhaps
not?

Yeah, mine blinks the light a bit too, but nothing more.

A vendor which apparently does specialise in Linux is Fintronic USA,

167.

The address is:

        Fintronic USA, Inc.
        1360 Willow Rd., Suite 205

The review is favourable, with the warning that some Unix experience,
or this newsgroup, will be required due to incomplete documentation.

Subject: ioctls to a portserver?
Date: Fri, 2 Sep 1994 21:18:36 GMT

I have a DigiBoard portserver16 connected to my Linux box.  I can
login to the host over the portserver just fine.  However, when I bring
up an editor that tries to turn off the XON/XOFF stuff on the port, it
has no effect on the portserver port.  Presumably, there is a pseudo port
or something on the host that is effected, but the long and the short is
that the ^S and ^Q chars get eaten up by the portserver and don't get
sent to the host.

Is this an inherent problem to logging in from a remote host or am I
doing something wrong?  Are there provisions in telnet/tcpip to effect
the actual remote port or is that kind of thing just not done?

Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Unix programming question
Date: 2 Sep 1994 10:14:20 +1000

I have programmed UNIX for a long time and feel frustrated with the way
software is installed on the system. Under UNIX people often have to 
hardwire the paths and settings into the executable at compile time.
This is in contrast with DOS that passes the full path name of the execuatble
as argv[0] so that you can search for library + data files. 

This is why DOS programmers can install all needed files into one
directory making it easier to maintain and backup. In UNIX after a while
you have no idea where to find the files. You also have binary
distribution problem where you have to make so many links and forget about
them. 

The UNIX shell can be modidied to pass the full path name into a program
but this will crash many existing programs or causing some real nuisance.

I just wonder if there is any one workin on proposing a standard for Linux
software layout that solve this problem. What I have done is to make the
binary fully configurable after compilation. 
   - Provide fee space within the executable at compile time
   - Provide a program 'register' that scan the executable and
     modify information in it (safely) to produced a customised one
     that knows where it is installed.

By doing this, I can move the distribution anywhere, change the path
stored inside the executable. That's it! No recompilation nor any other
hassels! I can even put a check sum to guard against corruption and virus
attack if I like. The program check itself before running.

Can any one give me some comment on this. Can any one see any flaw in this
method? I love to see some sensible guide lines developed for Linux
programmers (and UNIX) in general to ease the installation and
configuration of software.

Cheers,

Van Dao Mai

You can open a socket in SOCK_PACKET mode.
Look in the "packet driver" support in DOSEMU 0.53plxx for an example.

When your mouse is 3-button, don't set it to work as a Microsoft mouse.
Microsoft mice have only 2 buttons, and clone mice implement various
kludges to make the third button functional.

You better set it up as a Mousesystems mouse, which is 3-button.

You mean you like the idea of having 20 directories in your PATH variable,
one for each installed package, each of them full of files?  And the
system looking through all of these for each command you enter?
Especially with this nicely unlimited-length PATH variable in DOS this
is fun to have....

Windows is also a good example of how to do things right: just put 600
files into a single directory, and put it in the path.  Now everything
can be easily located....

I would have believed the creators of the operating system to be more
knowledgable about the impact this has on performance, and use some
subdirectories to improve that.  But noooooo...

sliplogin 1.1 is now uploaded on sunsite.unc.edu.
Should be moved soon to pub/Linux/system/Network/serial.
Changes since 1.0:

Refering to slip.login*:
New argument pid for slip.login files.
Update your old slip.login* if you are upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1 !
Refering to slip.hosts:
Changed slip mode "adaptive" to "auto" since there was no adaptive defined.
Changed slip mode "compress" to "compressed" since it looks better.
Added slip mode "ax25" for KISS AX.25 connections.
Update your old slip.hosts if you are upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1 !
General:
Some workarounds.Speed argument contains now the real speed.

I doubt these options will work under Linux.

The power management facilities are controlled by the BIOS, which is disabled
under Linux (except some PCI-BIOS Routines).
I don't know it exact, but here is how I would do that:

The BIOS grabs the timer interrupt and some other (keyboard, serial)
interrupts and measures the inactivity, after the maximum inactivity time,
in sends some commands to harddisk, videocard, etc. After activity
(receiving an interrupt) it enables harddisk, videocard, etc.

Linux does not give the BIOS any chance to do anything of these things above.

I have a green board on my own and are using under DOS some power saving
facilities, but I hadn't seen them work under Linux.

        The difficulty that most people seem to have is NOT with getty_ps
        but with the distributions of Linux that they are using... usually
        Slackware these days... With these, the pre-compiled binaries have
        been built according to the distributor's standards.. In the case
        of Slackware, Patrick uses the FSSTND standard and thus the default
        files and locks are not necessarily where one expects them... this
        is easily remedied.

        In order to address the entire issue, I wrote and made available on
        c.o.l.help a "mini-getty_ps-HOWTO" in which I provided detailed 
        examples from boot to grave of setting up serial lines through
        the exact working files I use in my uucp setups.  All of this information
        was extracted from existing HOWTO documents... all I did was read
        them and write an overview for newbies.   My point being that the
        information IS there and IS correct, it just may not jump out of the
        page and configure itself magically for your system... with the
        wide variety of ports cards, modems, and configurations of uucp
        this would be almost impossible!  :)

: (3) By contrast, several people told me that mgetty worked
: "out of the box". 

        I'm glad.. however, for complex uucp configurations and dial-in
        integrity and the need to reset several different brands of modems
        on the fly, it seems to break down or at least be a bit difficult
        to configure... please show me where I've gotten confused on this...
        I could have used a "mini-Mgetty-HOWTO" when I was tinkering around
        with it!  :

: (4) mgetty is well-documented, with a proper texinfo manual.
: getty_ps is not well-documented.

        Agreed.  I keep hoping to find a manual on it myself; until then
        I use the O'Reilly book... it's close enough!

: (5) If my experience is reasonably typical,
: then people should be told that they are likely to meet problems
: if they try to use getty (= getty_ps) for dialling in and out.

        Configuration, configuration, configuration.

: (6) I have been told at length that HOWTO authors are open to reason,
: and will modify their documents in response to suggestions.
: Unfortunately I have not found this to be the case.
: >If you have something positive to contribute to the Serial-HOWTO, I will
: >be more that happy to work something out with you.  I'm always on the 
: >lookout for more information and other alternatives.
: Well, I made the suggestion above to you some time ago.
: I'd be interested to know if you have successfully
: followed your own advice in the HOWTO for dialling in and out?
: Or are you just taking it on hearsay?

Comeon, Tim... an attitude like that just serves to piss off people who've
given their own time and effort to help others use something that they've
ALREADY mastered and thus could rightfully say "f**k off" to suggestions.  Be
happy that there are people who are still willing to persevere in the face of
public attacks on their attempts to help others.  It's been suggested before
in this thread and in others in which you've made the same assertions, so 
you'll probably flame me for saying it here... WRITE an Mgetty-HOWTO yourself!
It doesn't have to be "officially" sanctioned!  Do like I did... write it and
post it... be prepared to answer questions by email and even flames on the
net, but hell, that's what this anarchy is all about!  Just do something 
constructive to better Linux... it's easy to bitch, less so to teach and write.
If you've got suggestions you think may be included in a HOWTO, submit them...
or make your own mini-HOWTO and post it... I think you'll find it will be
welcomed by those who are out there searching for such knowledge as you can
impart to them!

   I got my copy too here in Taiwan. Taking a quick look, I  find
page 6, "RISC BASED MULTIPORT CARD" is interesting to me.

A program called scope is available to use the a/d converter on many 
sound cards. as an osciliscope.  I've never used it, but it sounds like it 
may even exceed your specifications. I think sunsite is the place to find 
the program.
