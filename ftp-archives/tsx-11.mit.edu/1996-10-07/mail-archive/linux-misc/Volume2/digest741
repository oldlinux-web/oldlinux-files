Ditto that question.

WHen I have xinit simply start doom, the colormap of the doom window
never becomes active -- I get a black, and a white, and that's it.

So my 'minimal' setup for domo is to start doom and fvwm, and put the
mouse in that window.

Those "disclaimers" don't relieve the fundamental problems that
people perceive with the GPL, namely, the fact that (a) source
mustg be provided, and (b) modifications must be copylefted as

Well, actually the XFree86 team says the MCGA mode will be in the SVGA
server of 3.1.  I also proposed in comp.windows.x.i386unix that they
add a "dualscan" flag that would set the pixel-doubling bit in the VGA

Well, Linux DOOM is out, and I must say it is a definitely a good translation.
I don't want to sound picky, because we all owe Dave Taylor a great deal of
thanks for porting this for us on his own time, but I've encountered a couple
of problems.

(1)  Pixel doubling, etc., doesn't work right.  I think other people have had
     this problem.

(2)  Switching to low detail only halves the size of the screen.

(3)  Do the function keys work?

(4)  I'm not sure if there is supposed to be music or not.  Does anybody get
     music or only sound effects?

(5)  I think the control keys stick sometimes, messing up my character
     bigtime.

(6)  Is there any way to have DOOM use only the colors available instead of
     grabbing the entire colormap?  I assume this is possible through
     Xresources or something, but how?

And finally, anybody know how to write a program to intercept the 16-bit audio
and convert it to 8-bit?  :-)

This is absolutely wrong. This viewpoint has nothing to do with
the fact that Linux is covered by the GPL. If you had bothered
to read my message, you would have known that. It has to do
with the fact that Linux systems use GNU software for nearly
all basic utilities, including the libraries.

The FSF is not taking credit for anything that they have not
done. What they HAVE done is provide a damn fine base upon
which to build a complete UNIX system such as Linux. Or did
believe that it was the Linux development team which wrote gcc,
libc, and the dozens of other software tools which your Linux
system depends upon to run?

Hi,

   I am using the Slackware dist. from tsx-11.mit.edu and it reports Linux

   If I do a dir I get:

   If I then do a cd / then ls produces what I think is a 'normal'  root

If you want a dumb ISDN router, buy one.
I'm going to sweat blood getting Linux ISDN to work - but I have special
reasons to want it that way (no net where it's going).

The cheapest ISDN router (in Europe) is probably a 286 box with a TeleS
card running ISPA and KA9Q. It does PPP, BONDING and lots of other junk.
I bet it will be *months* before ISDN Linux gets as functional as that.

I just ran DOOM on my 386/40 with a cheap (ISA) Cirrus VGA card.
I expected horrible performance, but it's only
a little bit jumpy, like a DOS game over a slow modem line.
DOOM runs just as it would under DOS, only now in an
X-window. Due to the small window size, the image is even somewhat
sharper now. 

All in all, this is something no Linux/X user should be without.
Even without high-end equipment, you really should see this!

Hi, Has anyone gotten the music to work in DOOM?

I've seen 1 person post with a SB16 who said it worked.

I thought doom was working perfectly, until I remembered there's
music too :)

My card passes the "fmtest" included in the sndkit.
(After I load the general midi patches... is this necessary?)


Also, do I have to compile in the MPU-401 support?

The PAS-16 emulates an MPU-401.

Is the DOOM code sensitive to Soundblaster IRQ?


Does the Music go out /dev/sequencer or /dev/midi, or /dev/dsp?

Finally, does anyone with a PAS-16 have music working?


THANKS DDT,  ID, and HANNU.  You're the greatest. Keep up the
great work.  I really appreciate the early release of Linuxxdoom.

How do these two boards compare for ease of setup, use, etc with Linux?

The 34F is a VLB board, the 1542 is ISA.  Does that mean you get DMA
above 16MB on the 34F?

I noticed something about manually having to give the disk dimensions
in the case of the 34F while reading the SCSI HOWTO.

I know that Ultrastore has gone bankrupt.

Any comments about the advisability of swapping out my 1542 for a 34F?

Finally, if I were to do so, would the 34F need to read the data on
my harddisk as it stands, or would I have to do a backup of everything
first and then load stuff back on?

(of course I make backups anyway, but I'd rather not have to reload
Linux...)

Subject: Re: Fascist GPL interpretation?

    If it is not a new position, could you please supply some references?
    That would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry, I don't understand.

    Again, I'd like to know what your reasons are.

Here's the explanation I wrote (though I would have expected you'd
have seen it by now).


Several years ago, I met with Steve Jobs, who was looking for some
alternative to making the Objective C front end free software.  (This
may have been due to worries about being hassled by Stepstone, rather
than a desire to be uncooperative.)  He asked me if it it would be
legal to ship proprietary .o files to the user and have the user link
them with the GNU compiler.

At that time, I envisaged the legal ramifications like some others who
have recently posted on this list, so I did not see a basis for saying
they could not do this.

But at the same time, I realized that it would not bode well for the
GNU project if such a thing were permitted.  So I responded, "I will
have to check with our lawyer."

It's a good thing I did, because when I checked, I found that there
was a basis for objecting to this plan.  Such .o files would have
implied the presence of the GNU compiler, linked with them.  They
would be, in effect, a way of distributing a larger program which
implicitly includes the GNU compiler; as such, it must follow the
terms on the GNU compiler.

I told NeXT this, and NeXT decided there was no alternative to making
the Objective C front end free software.  So now it is available to
all of us as a part of GCC.

Note that this is not a matter of copyrighting an interface.  The .o
files that NeXT planned to release would have used one of the
(internal) interfaces of the GNU compiler, but that was *not* what the
FSF objected to.  Our objection was because the use of these .o files
implied linking them with the GNU compiler--the program, not just an
interface.

If it were possible for a company to get around the GPL simply by
dressing up changes or extensions as "separate programs that the user
might link in", then the GPL would be a paper tiger.  (True, we often
print it on paper, but...)  So it is vital for the FSF to object.

If we made this a request rather than a legal demand, some people
would comply as a matter of conscience.  But many others who would
not.  If I had told Jobs, "It is legal, but please don't," I doubt he
would have heeded the request.

Many improvements to GNU software are contributed by, or funded by,
companies.  If they could make these improvements proprietary, many of
them would.  I consider these companies unethical (because making
proprietary software is unethical in general), but they don't share my
ethical views, and they don't feel they should forego profit for a
mere request from the FSF.

The only way to make sure these improvements are free software is to
make it hard to make them proprietary.  That's what the GPL is for,
and to make it work right, we must not permit getting around it by
"having the user do the link."
