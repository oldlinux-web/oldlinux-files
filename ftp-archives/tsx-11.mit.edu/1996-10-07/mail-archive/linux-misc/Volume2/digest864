Last I checked "fvwm" uses the least amount of memory.  But software
changes...  Has anyone done recent tests to findout:
        1. Which is fastest.
        2. Which uses the least memory.
        3. Which has the most options.

I think the reason olvwm is default with Slackware, is that it is a
more familiar environment previous SunOS users than "fvwm".  Although
with alittle configuration, the only way you can tell the difference
is those extra "fvwm" features that you won't be able to resist using.
I like being able to do all window management functions from
"GoodStuff" buttons, instead of silley little menus.

I think it was a fair question.  But the answer is, no you can't
specify that directly; mainly because no sane person would want to.
While the swapping/cache algorithms are not perfect, they are
normally much smarter than the user in desiding whether to reduce
the buffer size or swap programs.  The only reason you don't seem
to think so, is the buffer use is so transparent, that you only
notice it missing when you manually deactivate it with ext2fs
or such.  (This can be done on a per directory of a per file
basis.  Try reading the ext2fs documentation.)  I recommend you try:

 "su -c 'chattr -R +S /'"

Then after awhile switch back with:

  "su -c 'chattr -R -S /'"

I'm sure you'll notice the difference!!!

Agreed.  Piracy will only hurt us all at this stage of the game.  Perhaps the
approach should be to diplomatically apply some pressure on Waterloo to
release a student version for Linux.  Given the demographics of Linux's
user base, such a version would probably be enormously successful (relative
to the number of people who use Linux).  Also it seems, from recent experiences
that I've had helping people set up systems, that Linux is taking off in the
laboratory environment.  Certainly there will still be a market for their
original product.  In any case, this is definitely a good start.  For many of
us, a product like Maple is the most useful piece of software we could buy.
We just need to convince Waterloo that there is a legion of us out here who
would buy it in a minute if it were a bit more affordable.  The same remarks
can be made about Matlab (if a version for Linux were ever released).

Running an Indigo with 16 Megs is just like driving a Porsche
with an engine of a VW Bug. Put some more ram into this poor box
and you *will* have a fast machine. What you do is just like
running Linux on a P-90 with 4 Megs. Would you then say that Linux
is a slow and bad OS and that a P-90 is slower than a 68008/8 ???
Regarding the network stuff: I don't know which OS you're running
but you should try Irix 5.2 before blaming SGI.

I've got a cheapy modem, a Dynalink V1414VQE. It works fine, I have no
problems apart from I can't get the thing to auto-answer. The manual says
that all I do is write ATS0=1 and then it will all work. I do this, I even
write it back to the configuration RAM, the Auto Answer LED comes on
and it won't work.

I don't believe that it's my modem as it works fine receiving Faxes 
under Windows. I'm not an expert on modems (or anything else for that matter)
and so do not know if I need to pull DTR high or low or whatever arcane
chantings need to be done. I'm sure that it is pretty simple but none of the
doc or FAQs seem to help. 

If people want to mail directly to me I'll sumarise and then post back 
to the person who maintains the FAQs for inclusion. Nuff said.

Thanks.

Actually there would probably be a demand out there for those who keep
hearing about this Linux thing, and want to check it out at minimal expense.
You may have mentioned this already, and I may have just deleted it or 
forgot, but you could consider building upon the UMSDOS stuff for a file
system and use loadlin to boot from dos.

Let me think, what other features could you add????  How about:
        - Hard code a 640K memory limit into the kernel :)
        - Eliminate that pesky little -r option from the rm command
        - I've found cp, but where is xcp?
        - ????????.???
        - make sure and run this little script from rc.local (psuedo-code)
              while ( true ) {
                  sleep random(2hrs)
                  shutdown -h now
              }

Please don't take me too seriously ... my point is:  making a 
distribution that is within the ability of the average dos/mac 
weenie to understand is probably a good thing, but don't try too 
hard to cripple it.

You can find povray at sunsite.unc.edu. It's a pretty good ray-tracer.
There is also a package called Radiance that I got to compile

This sounds pretty cool. The currently do this with netblazers. there are
definantly some problems that could be encountered, such as line noise, and
packet regeneration.

If you are interested in pursueing this, I would be interested in working on

Funny.  I didn't realize that many AI labs were DOING AL stuff... Not
to mention that the DOD isn't too enamored of anything as long-shotish
as AL (IMHO, that is).  They're probably more interested in the immediate
optimization strategies, which HAVE been proven beneficial.

So?  They're intelligent agents, as well as evolving ones.  Clearly, whether
or not they succeed depends on both the intelligence of the choice they made,
and the luck of the draw - if Tk succeeds, then they're lucky, but if Tk
doesn't succeed, they're unlucky.  (In the sense of the Beta/VHS thing,
where something can't be decided on technical merits)

No, just AL with learning...

Neither of these is really true.  MS calls them multi-user because they

Well, we use Linux running in a IBM PS/Value Point 325T. It serve as a 
Internet Gateway for a collection of Novell Netware (almost 400 users) and
as a SMTP mail distributor.

Our connection is very new, and we don't expect more than 20 or 30 users
at time going to Internet thru the Linux (acting only as a IP router).

The SMTP is another history. We have MS-Mail for Windows for Novell users
and All-in-One in the Vaxes. The MS-Mail SMTP Gateway interchange mail with
the Vaxes using Linux's services. Linux serves as a mail gateway with
Internet too. 

Yours

What getty are you using?  And I know it may be obvious but are you
using /dev/cua? for outgoing and /dev/ttyS? for incoming as you
should be?
