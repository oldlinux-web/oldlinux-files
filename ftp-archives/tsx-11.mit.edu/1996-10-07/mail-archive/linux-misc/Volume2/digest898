To the rest of this group:  
=========================

Sorry this has descended into a flame war. I had a bad day too and having this 
snit publicly jump on my case, trying to put me down, solely because I expressed
a negative opinion about his current favorite toy, was more than I chose to 
take. 

I got onto this topic because of major install problems I was having with 
Yggdrasil Fall 94 and hoped I was just missing something. Reading through the
Linux newsgroups a common refrain emerged (and I paraphrase): "I'm having
major problems with the Yggdrasil install. After attempting x [where x > 1] 
installs, I still don't have this thing figured out...".

Yggdrasil's install process would be a thing of beauty, and a major reason to 
buy the product, IF IT WORKED. Unfortunately, it is inflexible and bug ridden.
It tries to do too much automatically and holds no options for recovering when
things don't work. Here are some examples:

  1) At the beginning of the install process, you are prompted
     for the disk device to partition. I have two SCSI drives attached
     to an Adaptec 1542B controller. When I attempt to say /dev/sda it 
     says 

             FATAL ERROR: Bad logical partition
                Press any key to exit fdisk

     Funny, Slackware, OS/2 and DOS (all installed on the same disk) don't 
     see any problems. I have no other option except skipping the disk partition
     phase of the install.

  2) Once I've selected the partition I want to install into, the install
     process insists on formatting and verifying all 257MB of it. No matter
     if it is the 1st install or the 10th install, I'm still forced to wait
     the 10 minutes or so it takes to analyze the partition even though I know
     it doesn't need it. Aaaarrrggggh. 

  3) When installing optional products, you have almost _no_ flexibility in
     chosing what code will be installed. Sure, you can install major pieces
     seperately, but what if I don't want to do X development, nor load server
     versions for 20 or 30 different video cards when I only have one in my 
     system? I'm given no option. I must load all 73MB on my system then 
     manually delete those parts I don't need (assuming I even know what I can
     delete without hosing the entire X server).

  4) When attempting to auto-detect my modem and mouse, the install process
     detected the mouse on the port where my modem is attached and detected no
     modem _at all_. Even though Linux has been happily using this modem and
     mouse for the last year. The result was that I'm thrown onto the X desktop
     with no mouse but fvwm waiting for me to click the mouse button to indicate
     where I want it to place the Control Panel window. I'm given absolutely
     no chance to override what the install process detected. I have to 
     reboot the system, manually edit the Xconfig file, and start again. Good
     thing I know where to find the Xconfig file. Many newcomers wouldn't. Nice.
    
Not exactly "Plug and Play", I'd say.

With Slackware, none of these were problems. The install process isn't as 
flashy but, dammit, it doesn't need to be. Its an _install_ process for God's 
sake! If I'm lucky, I'll never have to see it again.

I installed a working Slackware Linux distribution with GNU C, emacs, man 
pages and a VGA X server on my laptop with an 80MB disk (AND that was with a 
5MB swap file and 11MB free disk space left over!). The only way that could 
ever be done is by providing the installation flexibility that Slackware does.
With the current Yggdrasil state of affairs, this installation would be next
to impossible to do. 
     
My experience with Yggdrasil is that Unix running from a CD-ROM is an 
interesting curiosity but when I want real work done I don't have time to 
figure out what hoops I have to jump through to get rid of that damn CD-ROM
or cram those many megabytes of software into my few megabytes of disk space.
Instead, I look for solid and dependable software and Slackware has always
provided that to me, both in terms of the clean, flexible installation process
and Patrick's choices of stable software versions to include in his releases.

I wasted $35 on the Yggdrasil Fall 94 CD-ROM that I will never use. That won't
keep me from buying Yggdrasil in the future, particularly when they get their
install problems worked out, but it will make me more careful to check here
before I plunk down my cash.

(If you aren't interested in Jeff and I bitching at each other, please press
"n" now) 

Back to Jeff's comments:
========================

Hmmm. You start out conciliatory, but...

Sorry you were annoyed, Jeff, but I stand by the age-old net practice of 
deleting unnecessary or irrelevant content from posts one follows-up to. 
Doing so illustrates those items I care to respond to while making _my_ posts 
easier to wade through and saving bandwidth.

That's one of the reasons News servers keep weeks of posts online... so you
can fully review threads before you post to them. Use your newsreader's 
capabilities and stop expecting others to cater to _your_ whims. 

I answered _Jan's_ question with the solution I thought best and I, roughly, 
responded to each of his questions/comments in order. All the information you 
needed to place my post in context was available to you. All you had to do was
a bit of homework before you started bitching. If I didn't do things the way
you would have done them, and it bothered you, it's _your_ problem not mine.

I think its safe to say we disagree about the relative worth of the Yggdrasil
Fall 94 CD-ROM. Accept that. Try being constructive and telling the group what
is so great about Fall 94 instead of sarcastically attacking me for relating 
my negative experience with the product. 

I don't think anyone else here cares to watch us battle this out in public. 
This has _nothing_ to do with Yggdrasil's Fall 94 CD-ROM release. 
We _could_ start another thread about "Acceptable posting practices according 
to Jeff", but that's a topic for another newsgroup, not comp.os.linux.misc. 
If you do find an alternate newsgroup, particularly one that gives a damn, 
make sure and let me know. I'll come over and join the thread. 

Better yet, just take it to email.

Thanks.

When you find anyone porting GL or Alias to Linux, you may have an argument. I dont care what graphic adapter you may have or what windowing system you may have on Linux, until it does GL and it can do the POWER animation and surfacung things that are possible in IRIX, Linux won't be replacing SGI's anytime in the near future.

Dont take this wrong. I love Linux. Its the best thing Ive ever had on my madchine at home. But show me a modeling package capable of doing solids modeling, capable of using assumptions to perform surface analysis and render in 24 or 48bit color, something capable of importing IGES data and making it a solid, something capable of doing real-time 3D rotation and animation, something able to load a 600+MB model file and then rotate it under Linux or stop trying to compare them. Yes it may be there someday, b


ut not today and not tomorrow and probably not in the next 6 months.

But are any of the X news readers threaded? I haven't found one yet, unless 
I'm using older versions of xvnews and xrn.

Incidentally, is there a faq or something that lists the major X internet

Hi!!

I'm user of FreeBSD1.1.5.1.
I built my kernel with FreeBSD sound driver(orignated from Linux),
but it doesn't recognize my "Logitech SoundMan Wave".

SoundMan Wave uses OPL4 chip(compatible with OPL2,3) and Logitech
says it is 100% clone of SB and MPU401(uart mode).

I guess that it needs the special initialization sequence for
compatibility.

Any suggestion?

Thanks in advance.

To use this method, you have to

a) compile PLIP-support in the kernel

   electronic store)
c) choose two __different__ IP-numbers for both computers
d) enter them in /etc/hosts and create a /etc/exports-file for NFS
e) set up the connecting with 
   # ifconfig plip1 THIS_SIDE pointopoint OTHER_SIDE
   # route add OTHER_SIDE plip1
f) mount the filesystem:
   # mount -t nfs OTHER_SIDE:/ /DIRECTORY_FOR_OTHER_SIDE

Don't expect high bandwiths! I get ~30kByte/sec via FTP and only
~15kByte/sec via NFS, but it's quite comfortable and easy.

Not at all, not at all. Linux 'vi' (elvis in person), especially with
the capabiility to block-mark text with the "v" and "V" commands,
allows almost all normal word-processing functions (in the sense of
manipulating the character stream in the file) to be done very quickly
and very easily. An intelligent choice, say I (for this purpose).
Of course you have to know a thing or two, but the fact that "dw" deletes
the next word is less obscure than the WordPerfect "Ctrl-Del" and indeed
more logical: "db" deletes the previous word by the same logic;
what's the logical correlate in WordPerfect? (It's Home,BackSpace
if you want to know).

There is some confusion in this thread between word-processing (in the
above sense), text style (in the sense of font, bolding, point-size etc),
document formatting (headers, titles, layout), document formatting
(footnotes, sections, chapters etc), specials (equations, graphics, tables),
and creation of document components (TOC, index, bibliography, 
importing from databases/spreadsheeets, cross-references).

Almost any approach will handle all these different things as, in effect,
so many different modules. Approaches differ in the extent to which
these modules are bundled into one package or spread over several,
and in how well each module is implemented, and in whether the
approach is document-mark-up or "intrinsic" (like DTP appears to be), though
"intrinsic" is really hidden markup. The classic UNIX approach
(vi, document-tools, troff, tbl, eqn, pic, refer ... ) splits it
maximally (not always to good advantage); TeX tends to bundle it;
WordPerfect bundles it extensively; DTP is monolithic. Then there is
the WYSIWYG factor ....

I'm inclined to agree with those who find the markup->formetter
approach quickest and most productive, and that WYSIWIG can be
distracting; that's my experience after trying a lot of alternatives.
I'm a WUGIWYW man myself (What You Get Is What You Wanted), and
find I can get it with troff most of the time. But that's just
a function of age and experience ...

I saw a book titled "Unix for VMS users" and can't imagine that there isn't
something related for DOS. Of course, you can always get a good introduction
into Unix for users. The problem with Linux is that you have to perform some
essential system administration, so you have to get a book for that as well.

i spent quite a bit of time trying to get Vines running under OS/2 the other
day... it would quietly hang when booting.  I never could get it to work.
After that experience, I was pleasantly surprised when it took me about 5
minutes to get it running under dosemu 5.2.  Way to go on that built-in 
packet driver!

I'm having a small problem getting dialup to work 100%. That is; it works
most of the times, but every once in a while nothing happens after I
get the connect message. This means that I have to hangup and call again
to get the "login:" prompt.

The modem is a Zyxel 1496 Plus and I've got a 16550. The software I'm using
is Slackware 2.0 with the 1.1.45 kernel. I'm using the recommended line for
dialups in inittab with the exception that I've added RTS/CTS flow control.


Any suggestions?
