CHARTERS
========

rec.games.computer.doom.announce    Info/FAQs/reviews about DOOM. (Moderated)

  The sort of postings likely to be to be approved by the moderator are 
  general announcements that are interesting to the broad spectrum of DOOM 
  players.  Examples of these types of articles are:

   - Anything from id Software
   - New PWAD and LMP announcements
   - Announcements of new versions of utilities like DEU and DEHACKED
   - Tourney announcements
   - FTP site news (downtime, user limits, etc)
   - FAQs and similarly informative documents
   - Reviews of user-written PWADs

  The current moderator of alt.games.doom.announce, Tony Lezard, says that
  he'd be happy to moderate this newsgroup using the current addresses:

    Submit:  doom@mantis.co.uk
    Contact: doom-request@mantis.co.uk (Tony Lezard)

  This newsgroup replaces alt.games.doom.announce.

rec.games.computer.doom.help        DOOM Help Service (new players welcome).

  This unmoderated newsgroup is the headquarters of the DOOM Help Service.
  Readers new to USENET or to DOOM who post questions here will receive a
  flame-free friendly response from experienced USENETters and DOOM players.
  Game setup, hardware problems, modem/network setup, secrets, cheats, how
  to get DOOM and related utilities are a few examples of suitable topics.

  Questions about modifying/editing levels belong in the .editing group.

  This newsgroup replaces alt.games.doom.newplayers.

rec.games.computer.doom.misc        Talking about DOOM and id Software.

  Here is where discussion occurs about non-play-related issues that
  aren't suitable (or only marginally so) for the other subgroups.
  Examples are FTP issues, ports of DOOM to other systems, piracy,
  "DOOM - the Movie", DOOM II vs. DOOM, what's the best soundcard, 
  DOOM-related ads, comparisons with other games, magazine articles, 
  people at id and their cars, future id plans (Quake).  In general, 
  if it isn't about actually playing or editing DOOM, post it here.    

rec.games.computer.doom.editing     Editing and hacking DOOM-related files.

  Discussion here covers modifying the DOOM environment, especially the
  EXE and WAD files.  There are many user-written utilities available that  
  do these types of things.  Some authors and experienced users can answer
  questions about design techniques and using the utilities.  Examples of
  topics are effects of design error (HOM, Medusa), design problems in 
  user-written PWADs, modifying default DOOM behavior, utility enhancements.

  Comments or questions about playing user-written PWADs (opinions, keys, 
  secrets, etc.) should not be posted here - post in .playing instead.

rec.games.computer.doom.playing     Playing DOOM and user-created levels.

  Discussion about playing DOOM takes place here (not only about playing
  id's original levels, but also about playing user-written PWADs).
  Topics include how to find secrets, keyboard/mouse movement techniques, 
  side-effects of playing DOOM, where to find good PWADS (and which ones 
  are favorites), deathmatch experiences, and so forth.

  Tournament discussions and multi-player topics can go here, too.

  PWAD upload notices can be posted here when not posted in .announce.

  Non-play-related topics belong in the .misc group (this includes Quake).


EPILOGUE TO 3RD RFD
===================

  My reluctant decision to remove .ports and .multiplayers and go with 
  just the 5 main groups was widely supported:

    Looks fine to me.  Enjoy.                 -  Francis Uy
    I'd not be against any of these groups.   -  William Harris
    I'm all for it.                           -  Raphael Quinet
    I have no problem with this.              -  Doug Barton
    This works for me. Let's start voting.    -  Clint in Alaska

  I've modified some of the charters to merge in multiplayer/Quake info.

  I'm submitting the Call for Votes request to Ron Dippold and asking
  for voting to commence as early as 'legally' possible, which is on
  Thursday, Oct 13.  There may be a few days' delay, but expect the CFV
  sometime that week.  Voting will last for 22 days.  Following the vote, 
  there is a 5 day discussion period after which the newsgroups that passed 
  will be created by the moderator of news.announce.newgroups.

Well, first off, I've heard that the code for Linux DOOM is pure C, whereas
the DOS version has some optimized assembly in it for speed. So you should
expect less performance.

I've killed everything, but not doing a renice. Anyway, I have 486DX/2-66,
and it ran slowwww. I have a local-bus ET-4000 (not accelerated) and I wasn't
impressed with it. However, it was kinda nice to run two DOOM sessions
side-by-side and watch the demo's play.

The first time I heard of it, was version 0.96. I was running around
asking everybody, how much memory I would need to install UN*X and
dreaming of installing it (I just heard UN*X is better than DOS)! They
all told me UN*X and PC, forget it!!!

Than I found out, that there's something called Linux; I just wanted
to install it, but I had no machine to install it on (to that point
I couldn't afford to buy one, where I could install a good UN*X),
so I began installing it at the university (in a DOS lab; DOS just
used 40megs of the HD, so there were 70 left for me)...

That was my first touch with UN*X/Linux; I loved it from the beginning,
because it isn't difficult, just type apropos :) and ... 
Sure it took me one to two week to figure out how to install X, another
two for compiling the kernel with networking... It took 1 Term till I had
everything I wanted, even things I never could have at home (Network,
Mail, ...)

SO THANKS TO LINUS AND EVERYBODY ELSE, who did a lot of work on Linux!!!

When you get right down to it, an Intel 486 is really nothing more
than an improved 386 with a 387 thrown in for good measure.  The
architectural differences between a 386 and a 486 are far smaller
than those between the 286 and 386 or those between the 486 and
586/pentium.

I pulled the sources for both xvnews and xrn. I could not get xvnews to
post, even though I liked its layout better than xrn. Both xvnews and xrn
allow sorting of subject lines, ignoring the "re:" stuff which gives a
certain amount of threading.

I read news from netcoms' nntp server over a cslip link and found that
tin -r was just plain unbearably slow. Otherwise I'd use tin, since it
some useful features that I wished the X readers had. Xvnews was better than
xrn, because xrn insists on displaying the first article in the groups
list. This makes entering a new group a crap shoot; *.answer groups
all have looong articles. On a slow link, this makes xrn a pain. Also,
if I save locally, xrn is too brain-dead to remember that I already have
the article up, and goes and pulls it from the nntp server again! Lastly,
xrn (and I think xvnews did this too), do not use a proper select() or
poll() call in their X message/nntp loop. The result is that redraw messages
are not honored while xrn awaits a response from the server. This offends
my sensibility about the proper behaviour that X apps should exhibits.
Still, I do use xrn and maybe someday I'll write something that is not
only X aware, but also more efficient with slow links and has the features
of tin.

Let me know if there is something already out there like that. Thanks.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

I am still working on it but not as much as before. I have just got a
bugfix for it which I have put in. I was trying to get QUOTA into the
standard kernel before 1.2. I have send it so Linus several times but
because of the changes in the last patchlevels in the filesystem layer
I always was behind in patching my patches up to te latest version.
If 1.2 comes out soon now and won't include QUOTA as a standard option
I will release a quota-1.34 soon. For now I am busy with some other
things but will try to maintain quota. An no I don't need anyone doing
it for me, it hasn't changed much lateley and it seems to be quite stable.
That is at least on the machines I work on and that are about (5 or 6 at
the moment). And it seems to work for more people because 41 people have
registered.

Maybe I make a pre-release for the people who have registered as systems
that use QUOTA.
