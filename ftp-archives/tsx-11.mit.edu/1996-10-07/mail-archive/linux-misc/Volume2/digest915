There is no sane SVGA style 320x200 mode timing that produce the standard
VGA horizontal and vertical scan rates. The problem is that the standard
VGA 200-line modes use a certain 'doublescan' bit that XFree86 2.1/2.1.1/
3.1 do not know about (3.1.1 will). If you attempt to define a 320x200
mode anyway with a 25 MHz dot clock you are likely causing a horizontal
sync twice and a vertical sync four times as high as the standard
VGA 320x200 mode needs. This is way above the spec of most monitors, even
most high-end ones. If even if such a mode appears to work it may be
operating at a sync rate 20% or so above spec and could cause damage. 

If your server/chipset driver provides a 12.5 MHz clock, you can define 
a sane 320x400 mode and work with that.

Here's a little C program that will enable/disable the VGA doublescan
bit. It should safe, but you never know so try it AT YOUR OWN RISK.
Run it while in the server with a mode like 320x400. Read the
description at the start.

===== 

/*
 * This program enables the VGA scanline doubling bit at
 * CRTC register 0x09.
 * It should work on all SVGA chipsets that honour the bit
 * when in SVGA mode.
 *
 * It requires double vertical timings to be programmed, i.e.
 * set up mode timings for 320x400, and use this program while running
 * the server in this mode to get an effective 320x200 resolution with
 * exactly the same monitor timings. This means it should be safe
 * given that the 320x400 mode is within specs.
 *
 * Sample mode: (70 Hz, 31.5 kHz hsync)
 * Modeline "320x400" 12.588  320 336 384 400  400 409 411 450
 *
 * Note that the cursor position mapping will be incorrect after
 * enabling the doublescan bit.
 *
 * If the driver you are using doesn't provide a 12.5 MHz clock
 * you are out of luck. There are ways to obtain such a clock
 * but experimenting can be dangerous. The only safe way is to have
 * the chipset driver provide it in its set of clocks.
 *
 * Here are alternative low-res mode with doublescan with a 25 MHz
 * clock, but they require a high horizontal sync. THESE MODES CAN ONLY
 * WORK IF YOUR MONITOR IS SPECED FOR 40/48 kHz HORIZONTAL SYNC (which
 * usually means a monitor than can do 1024x768 non-interlaced at
 * at least 60 Hz). The first mode results in 480x300, with the same
 * aspect ratio as 320x200. The second is 400x300, derived from
 * 800x600 @ 72 Hz.
 *
 * # 480x600, 63 Hz, 39.6 kHz hsync
 * Modeline "480x600" 25  480 496 576 632  600 601 605 628
 * # 400x600, 72 Hz, 48.0 kHz hsync
 * Modeline "400x600" 25  400 424 488 520  600 637 643 666
 *
 * Here's an alternative mode with a dot clock of 18 MHz that

Who has the best rates for dialup PPP access.  I am in the Southeastrn
Michigan (810 or 313 area code).  I am currently using Merit, but my local

Nobody can help you without seeing what you were doing, based only on
a vague description of the problem, like yours. So, next time post 
something like:

    ues4:~/tmp 18> cat hello.c
    #include <stdio.h>

    main()
    {
    printf("hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
    }
    ues4:~/tmp 19> gcc hello.c
    ues4:~/tmp 20> ./a.out 
    hello, world!

As you can see, it worked for me :-)

It is not on most systems. If you run ps -u after running Doom for a while,
you'll find that time spent in the X server (i.e. shared memory image
overhead, copy to video memory, X overhead) is very much less than the
time spent in the Doom process itself (although some of the shared memory
image overhead could be in the Doom process).

I don't think this is a significant factor. Programs/processes that
don't need CPU don't use CPU. That's the whole point of Linux.

However, the SVGA server from XFree 3.1 knows 320x200x256 without the
need for a modeline; choose generic svga and it works.

My ZyXEL program (available on sunsite in /pub/linux/system/Serial)
can do this.
It is written for ZyXEL modems, but with some care and by passing the
-Z flag you can use it on some generic fax+data modems as well...

Use my special program for the ZyXEL, available from sunsite in directory

For me it works all the time.  Plus you can use it as a FAX and an answering

I think that emacs as a wordprocessor/editor is in a league of its
own, regardless if you are using it as a programmers editor or as
"front-end" for LaTeX. That is how I meant this remark. But yes,
Emacs comes with pre-configured assistance for *.tex and *.bib
files (e.g. templates for bibtex-entries and stuff like that).

If Matt Welsh continues his Emacs-tutorial in Linux Journal, he
eventually will get to this subject. (I hope).

A while back a group was formed to write a word processor for Linux.
However, I knew from the beginning that it would fail.  If another group is
formed to start this project again, please consider why the project failed
and do not make the same mistakes again.

The reason for its failure is simple:  The initial goals and expectations
were too high.  The wordprocessor was to read/write LaTeX files.  It was to
be extensible like emacs.  It was a pipe dream.

Think about what features you really need and do not expect to compete with
TeX/LaTeX.  Instead, concentrate on simply getting something like PC-Write
about 1984 or so.  Do not even worry about reading/writing Word/Wordperfect
files.  These commercial wordprocessors contain features that the initial
Linux one will not be able to handle any way.  Just concentrate on the
Wordprocessor itself and worry about compatablility with other WPs. Once you
get that level you can start adding more features-- like thinking about an X
version.

If you set realistic goals I will be more than happy to participate.
