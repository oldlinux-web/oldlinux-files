Dear Steve,

****************************************************************
                     Maple V Release 3 and Linux
****************************************************************
Thank you for your message indicating your interest in Maple for Linux.
Waterloo Maple Software has recently completed a port to the Linux operating
system and the product is now available for shipping.

Maple was compiled under Linux kernel 1.0. Disk space use is standard 
for a UNIX port: 30 MB.  If the user is running X and xmaple, then 8 MB 
of RAM are essential. 

The academic price for a single copy of Linux is $595.00 (US)

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact us.

I was reading in the NET2 HOWTO that someone has a 
package out for connecting DOS workstations to Linux
/Unix workstation/servers.  It was call something 
like Sams Own Server System (SOSS).  I however use
Novells LanWorkplace for DOS/Windows which works
great.  This package lets you telnet/ftp in DOS or 
Windows and also comes with a host of other utils
like rsh.  One of the coolest apps it gives you 
is a Windows drag and drop ftp.  To get to Netware
from my Linux system I run a small Windows background
FTP server which lets me FTP from my Linux system and
see all the attached drives of my Windows system.  Lan
Workplace is buck though..around $300 per node. Hopes this
helps out

C++ provides an interesting way to address this. The language is internally
extensible. Thus one can define a matrix class and define the standard
operators: +, -, * etc to be the standard operations on matrices. That
is the approach I adopted in ObjectProDSP. Rather than create a new
language for defining Digital Signal Processing (DSP) networks I used the
internal extension capabilities of C++.

This approach does not force one to use a compiler. I wrote an interpreter
for a fragment of C++ that allows one to use this language interactively.
Then I provided facilities for creating and editing networks using menus
and the mouse. These actions generate statements in this DSP language
and those statements are interpreted interactively to create DSP nodes
and edit them into a network. A user can start with only knowing about
menus and which mouse buttons to click to edit a network. This is all
she needs to fully use my tool. If she wants she can quickly
come to understand the DSP language statements that are generated (and
can be displayed) when she edits a DSP network graphically. In many cases
it can be quicker to write this code directly rather then play with
the mouse and menus. This code no matter how it is created and no
matter how little the user knows about C++ is syntactically correct
C++ code.

With this approach I have defined an application oriented language that is
easy and natural for people working in DSP to understand and use. Because
it is done in the framework of C++ it can be extended to support anything
that can be supported in C++. If you start with a lesser framework you are
almost certainly going to adopt syntax conventions that sooner or later will
come to haunt you and limit the extensibility of your language.

Of course C++ is not an ideal language and Richard Stallman is critical
of its syntax just as he is critical of Tcl. Bjare Stoustup made a deliberate
decision in designing C++ to maintain nearly complete upward compatibility
with C. The result is a syntax that is not ideal but has been of enormous
practical value.

C++ may not be the perfect foundation for application oriented languages
but it is the best practical foundation we have today. It is a foundation
that allows the language to grow indefinitely and still maintain a reasonably
clean structure. This is an essential element if a language is to grow over
time to include more applications and more sophisticated operations in
the applications it addresses.

The architecture of ObjectProDSP and ObjectPro++ were designed to support
such indefinite extensibility. The challenge is not to provide a language
that addresses a single application area but to provide a framework for
integrating many application areas so they work together. We need to do
this in a way that each application has a language that is natural and
intuitive for those working in that area. That is the problem I was
addressing and why I choose C++ as a foundation for my application language.

I think I'm 130B user mentioned.  I just wanted to note that this was an

That combination in general should add no more complexities beyond your

I use WP at work on a SparcStation.  I use WP under Windows
at home.  WP is the only utility I'm missing from my
Linux arsenal.  Questions: does it run under Linux?  What problems
have people encountered?  Would anybody recommend it?

I should sadly note that the Windows version is much faster
than the SparcStation (the Sun having >3x mips), but of course not as
reliable.  I'd guess that SCO WP is like molasses.

I'd appreciate any comments, preferably mail (arnholt@mayo.edu)

Subject: Linux & IBM Thinkpad 500?
Date: Sun, 25 Sep 1994 07:59:50 GMT

Many thanks to all who sent me mail regarding my earlier query regarding
Linux and subnotebook machines in general.  I've pretty much narrowed my
choices to two machines (based mostly on budget):  The Toshiba T3400 and
the IBM Thinkpad 500.

The Toshiba does look good.  I've seen it for about $1050 (or $900 for a
refurbished unit), it seems peppy & has a good warranty, and most importatly
I've heard from someone who is running Linux on it already, so I know that
part works.

I've seen the Thinkpad 500 for around $1000 ($800 used) in a 4MB/170MB
configuration.  The cheaper price and extra 50 megs of HD are nice (as is
the angular black case), but I have not been able to find one of these
machines in person, and I haven't heard from anyone running Linux on this
specific Thinkpad model (though the Installation HOWTO does mention
Thinkpads in general).  I'm mainly concerned with the screen controls, which
are buttons rather than sliders, and might be under the influence of software.

If you've seen or used Linux on this machine, or just have some more general
data you'd be willing to share, e-mail would be infinitely appreciated.

The student version of Maple for Windows is generally available
for CDN$100.

You should note that the price that was quoted for Maple for Linux
was not the student version.

 You might   try  sending it  with the   contents described  as 'dirty
underwear' or something like that, then they wont  open the package in
customs. Be  sure to wrap  the bottles  up  in something so that  they
don't make any sound (or break) when the package is rattled... :)
