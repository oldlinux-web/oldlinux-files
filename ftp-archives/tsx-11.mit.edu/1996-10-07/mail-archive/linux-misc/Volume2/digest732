yes.

The sound is great provided my linux box isn't under heavy load
from other processes running, etc. Then the sound goes PSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH
PSSHHHHHH like the card is DMA-ing garbage. that's not a doom thing

Actually, just calling bootpc like

It *is* legal.  DOOM! is shareware -- you get the first of three
episodes for free; if you register it you get episodes 2 and 3.  When
you register it you get the disks for the DOS version, but it is OK,
because all you need to do is to replace the .WAD file in the
shareware version with the full version and you have the whole game.

Apparenly you can also buy DOOM II and use it with the Linux version
in the same way.

If you use TIA (The Internet Adaptor) on the remote end, you should
be able to run Linux DOOM on a shell account without SLIP/PPP!

TIA is a program that you run on the remote shell account to emulate a
SLIP / PPP server.  You simply run your Linux/unix/DOS/Windows SLIP/PPP
software on your local end.

It supports TCP and UDP (not ICMP).  I hear that Linux DOOM uses only
TCP and/or UDP so it should work with TIA.  You can have a free
trial of TIA.  Get documents from FTP or WWW at marketplace.com ....

An extended partition is a partition that contains other partitions (to get
around an early DOS limitation of 4 partitions in a backward compatible
way).  Tagging it as something else doesn't make any sense.  Making you
delete it might help get your attention if it isn't empty, too.

If you read the README.linux file carefully, you will note that Dave
is already aware of the problem.  His description of the magnification
option(s) (-1, -2, -3, etc. on the command line) concludes with
something to the effect of "this turns out to be a bad idea on Linux".

The only way to do this is to bug ID directly.  The 1-800-IDGAMES number 
is a contract outfit.  There response will likely be, "Linux, what the 
hell does DOOM have to do with Charlie Brown."  

So, I would suggest someone maintain a list of all the people who use 
LINUX and have registered.  Individual mailings will get ignored after 
awhile.  

Another DOOM note:  infant2.sphs.indiana.edu is the "Official 3rd-party 
add-on site."

There is a Linux version of the freeware "DEU:  Doom Editor Utilities".  
/pub/doom/deu/linx* .  This program allows you to create new levels from 
scratch.  Someone needs to do a Linux port of IDBSP...

In /pub/doom/wads tree structure are hundreds (120 megs worth) of user 
created doom levels.  So, if you register DOOM you will have access to 
basically unlimited replayability.

Not to put too much of a damper on this, but the kernel of the Fall 94 
from yygdrasil has given some of us some problems.  My system runs summer 
94 just fine (which I am still using, with the programs from Fall 
release) but Fall94 blows up big-time when it tries to initialize the VFS 
with a null-pointer refernce and a subsequent register dump.

I called yygdrasil, and they said that they had just gotten another call 
on thsi problem and were looking into it.

On the bright side, the Fall94 has a much nicer, more streamlined and 
friendly install as well as command line-options for everything you used 
to have to do from x (adding users, installing addition packages,etc.)

Anyway, just be warned about the kernel issue.  I'm sure yygdrasil will 
have it resolved fairly soon...

        I've already put in a request to Robert Nation for a DoomLock
function, that acts like the current LOck but also ignores the defined
keys.
        For now, you can edit your .fvwmrc file and change DeskTopSize
to 1x1 while you play doom. I'd like to know what's up with the alt key
though. On my system, it's acting like a toggle.

Edit your .fvwmrc (or fvwmrc.system) file and comment out the "Key" entries
