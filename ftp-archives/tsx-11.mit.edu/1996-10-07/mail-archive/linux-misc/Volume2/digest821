if you have term 1.19 or higher you can use trdated to periodically generate
traffic. It checks the clock on your remote system and sets your local clock
to this time. It can be set to do its job every #minutes.

Date: 25 Sep 1994 15:05:38 GMT

The STB Lightspeed VL is a really fast card based on the W32i/ET4000.
But I noticed it also has video mode 0x21 which adds 132x60 capability,
but this was not in the setup.S, though it was simple to add.

I remember asking for a card that supported 132x60 text and no one mentioned
this (Trident and Oak were the only others that I know supported this mode).

I am really pleased with this card.  It does DOS, Windows, and Linux - X
windows very fast and it coexists with my monochrome adapter and my 8514/a
card and doesn't require anything funny in the memory map.  It also seems to
have VESA modes in ROM.

People occasionally ask what video card to get.  They should definately
check out this card.  I paid just  under $200, which is the current street
price in my area.  (You may have other applications which would dictate
using a different card, so investigate your options - I am just saying I
know this card works for my application).

Nothing if your remote machine name is 'remotehost.ucsb.edu'.  You
can specify any hostname you wish.  Forexample, to telnet my machine 
you could do:

  tredir 4023 physics.purdue.edu:4023; telnet localhost 4023

However, this isn't the recommended way of doing things, as you have
to kill the old tredir command befor you can do the new one.  Better
is to use a telnet that is term aware.  This requires, that the you
recompile telnet...  However, since I can tell by your heavy
cross-posting that you are a Linux user, there is another alternate.
Pickup the program:

   physics.purdue.edu:/pub/bcr/term/extra/Linux/termify-0.1.tar.gz

Once you've installed this you can do:

  termify telnet;mv telnet telnet.orig;ln -s termtelnet telnet

and then you won't need the messy "tredir" commands anymore.

With ftp, you can't use a tredir command, so making a term aware
version of ftp is your only option.  Again this can be done with:

  termify ftp;mv ftp ftp.orig;ln -s termftp ftp

Personally, I really like these keyboards.  They have an extra * key
between Ctrl and Alt which I use an Xmodmap to configure as the X
Super key (extra shift key; X supports Mode_shift, Shift, Alt, Ctrl,
Meta, Super and Hyper, but on PC keyboards generally Alt == Meta),
which I use for all my personal Emacs key bindings.

Well, you can write them in *roff source using the supposedly
documented man macros. But what I plan on doing is using the
rosetta-man package (I believe you can archie for rman). This
is a small package which converts man pages to many formats but
one of its nicest features is that it can convert preformatted
text into *roff source! 

OIf course, nobody says you can't make manually formatted man pages.
But many people prefer them unformatted (nicer output on various
devices).

Yes, and it *is* in the buffer. And you can't access it.
I have this behaviour too, it started with one version of
fvwm/rxvt/XFree/weather/seasons... Sometimes it works, sometimes not.
Strange.

Download "xcb", (I don't remember where I got it from, may be the
X11 contribs, the file I have is xcb-2.2.tar.gz).

It is a cut/paste buffer manager; you can see in real time several
X11 cut/paste buffers and what text they contain.

You'll see the text you can no longer paste, in the buffer.

(And with this little tool you just have to click on it to select it
 one more time and paste it anywhere, by the way).

Assuming that the rest of the networking configuration is proprely
set on your machine, the part of the README.Linux file starting
with these lines:


/* -- begin quote ---*/
CONNECTING TO A PPP SERVER

To use PPP, you invoke the pppd program with appropriate options.
Everything you need to know is contained in the pppd(8) manual page.
However, it's useful to see some examples:

Example 1: A simple dial-up connection.

Here's a command for connecting to a PPP server by modem.

  pppd connect 'chat -v "" ATDT5551212 CONNECT "" ogin: ppp word: whitewater' \
      /dev/cua1 38400 -detach debug crtscts modem defaultroute 192.1.1.17:

Going through pppd's options in order:        
/* -- end quote ---*/

...should be sufficient to get you started.

(The login chat script can also be used to start a command on the
 remote machine, if the remote PPP is not starded as a login shell).

Well, this is Jobs way of operating: He has a clear vision of
a working environment he would like. He looks at the current
hardware and doubles its capacity. This will make sure, his
vision will run on the machines available three years later.

Then he rips the best out of the current technologies and
techniques and integrates it into one environment.

His approach is revolutionary, not evolutionary. He does not
care about compatibility - he never did - because he just
cannot stand the second best solution. He has done this twice
and the result was a working environment that was ahead of its
time at least five years.

For example

I am working in Nextstep and X environments and I have to code
for both for several years now. And I thank god every morning
that Next did not choose X, but did the Right Thing. X sucks,
it sucks so much you almost cannot stand it. It one single pile
of poorly designed, unfinished, not-thought-to-the-end,
unpolished, memory wasting, ressource hogging thesises thrown
upon each other and Motif makes it even worse.

We have five Gateway 2000 P5/90 machines with 32 megs ram, 2 Gig
Segate barracuda SCSI drives, NCR53c825 PCI controllers, NEC
Multispin 3X CD/Rom drives and ATI Mach 64 4 Meg video cards.
Installation was not quite straight forward since everything
was bleeding edge, but, they are very fast. Especially with
the Barracuda drives. We are having some crashes though with 
the 1.1.50 kernel, seems to be related to heavy network traffic.
I do mean heavy. Anyway the machines are great except their 
standard keyboards are very non (101 key) standard. They've 
added things like diagonal cursor keys and one thing that really 
sucks is that you can (very easily) accidentally put the KB in
program/remap mode and totally confuse it and yourself.

We are currently in the code freeze.  That letter, posted to usenet,

in preparation for the stable 1.2 series.

Linus is in Australia, and intends to release 1.2 sometime after his

when, since he hasn't said exactly either.
