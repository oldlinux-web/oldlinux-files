Right. If you run 'ps -u' after running Doom for a while, you'll see
that the amount of time used by the X server (transferring the
framebuffer to the screen, and X overhead) is relatively small on
local bus cards. Linux X Doom is a non-x86 optimized version. Main
memory performance is probably also a factor due to the larger/more
fragmented memory footprint; it is pathetic on most motherboards.

Hi Paul!

Why don't you just take a passive card like from Teles, Berlin or
from Creatix (which is an Teles-OEM-Product).  It's a software-
configurable card (interrupt & adress-space), it uses the 
Siemens/AMD ISAC and HSCX chips and is VERY cheap.  Without VAT
it should be around $120.  There is a broad range of those cards
installed in Germany and other parts of Europe.  If your drivers
would support NI-1 and EDSS-1 I guess you could get an even 
bigger market-share...

if you have questions, just send me a mail...

Technologies are quickly shared between all the OSes. So Linux, and *BSD are
actually have the whole group contributing the features found in the OS. 
So what are the major things to look for when choosing an OS (IMHO)?

1) the basic "flavor" of Unix you like. Besides being Posix compliant, I think
   everyone can agree that Linux is a System V based OS and *BSD is BSD based
   OS. there is a slight philosophy difference.

2) what form of support (releases, question answering, porting, testing,
   attitude), etc.  If you are happy with your support then that OS is where
   you belong.

3) there is a slight culture difference between all of the groups. IMO, Linux
   is more DOS friendly, *BSD are more DOS-phobic. NetBSD is multi-platform,
   FreeBSD more conservative for stability sake. Right now each are very
   stable, growing, have many overly-dedicated workers.

It is difficult to answer "which OS is better?", because the answer would
be, "for me, MINE is better".

    Linux DOOM doesn't really use the accelerated functions of any video
cards, does it? Note that running DOOM in an X session that uses accelerated
drivers will *not* accelerate DOOM itself. It's still working with a virtual
"dumb frame buffer", no?

You can get LaTeX modes for emacs to make life a little easier... It remaps

        Yes, there's room for   more  than Linux, the   taste  differs
fortunately. There probably is no use to try to get everyone to switch
over to Linux, that will come in time, because  people that you try to
force  inte  switching will never  like it.  We just  have  to keep on
telling them how good Linux (and ^z) is so  that everyone gets jealous

someone who can answer this question?

I have a Diamond Stealth VLB.  Does the XFree386 allow me to use Xwindows?
Is that file all I need (the 2.1.1)  Is this the latest version?
Someone mentioned 3.1 (but is this a typo)

I partitioned 350 megs for Linux and 16 meg for the swap file.
But when I do a df, its not there.  what command do i use to see it?

I get warnings about physical and logical cylinders not matching when
I run fdisk, etc.  (I made the CMOS type 47, with >1024 cylinders)
Should I change it back to 1024?  But if i do, Linux doesn't recognize
I have more than 1024 because linux takes its info off of the CMOS
right?  So is it ok the way I did it?  with those occassional warnings
about some software might not work with it?

Can someone tell me, what is the correct procedure for patching a kernel?
I cant recall, but you are supposed to give an option when updating,
or making the files. and you are supposed to do things in certain directories.
anyways if you dont give the options, it misses out something.  What was it?
can someone tell me?

Subject: Document on PCI Information - read me if you are thinking about PCI
Date: Wed, 5 Oct 1994 17:18:57

PCI or not to PCI?
==================
Well about two weeks ago I asked for some information on PCI motherboards 
and the amount of information was overwhelming.  But I promised I would put 
the information together in a document and post it to the comp.os.linux.misc 
conference.  I will also have a copy of this available by 
ftp://succeed.ee.vt.edu/pub/pci/pci.txt.  If you have any corrections to this 
information feel free to email me at smhenry@vt.edu.  Please let me know if 
this is helpful at all or if there is other information you would like 
included.


Its time to upgrade...
======================
Well you may be in the position I was and decide to upgrade your computer. 
And of course you want to maintain your Linux compatibility as well as improve 
your Linux performance, so what should I do? Well at first I was going to 
upgrade to a 486DX2/66 or 486DX2/80, and I was trying to decide to whether or 
not to go the VLB or PCI route.  From information I have read, PCI is nice and 
will make the transition to a Pentium motherboard easier since you do not have 
to upgrade your video and hard disk controller.  However as far as performance 
is concerned, you will not see that drastic of an improvement over VLB (it is 
debatable if VLB is slightly faster than PCI on a 486 system).  So if you plan 
on upgrading your motherboard at a later date with a Pentium motherboard, it 
would probably be prudent to go with PCI.  But if you are trying to save a 
buck and plan on replacing your motherboard, graphics card, and controller 
card, then VLB is the way to go.


What exactly is PCI?
============================
PCI is a bus standard.  It was developed to increase the performance between 
the processor and periphals (graphics cards, controller cards, network cards). 
PCI is a better standard than VLB and will most likely outlive VLB.   PCI 
devices are generally easier to develop than their VLB counterparts.  
Currently the PCI bus is 32 bit and the speed of the bus is tied to the speed 
of the processor.  There are extensions for the PCI bus to go 64 bit but there 
are no widely available 64 bit cards (the 64 bit graphics cards are 
misleading, they only have a 32 bit bus).  Generally with a Pentium-60, the 
bus will operate at 30 MHz, and with a Pentium-66 the bus operates at 33MHz (I 
do not know what the bus operates at for a Pentium-90).  It is my 
understanding that the current PCI spec does not support any speeds over 33 
MHz.  Devices on a PCI bus look different than devices on a VLB/ISA 
motherboard.  PCI uses level-triggered slot-specific interrupts, whereas VLB 
uses edge triggered ISA bus interrupts. 

For exact PCI specifications contact:

PCI Special Interest Group
M/S JF2-51
5200 N.E. Elam Young Parkway
Hillsboro, Oregon 97124-6497
(503)696-6111

Non-members of the PCI SIG may request a PCI Local Bus Specification for
$25 + shipping costs by calling:
1-800-433-5177


Well I want a PCI motherboard. Which one should I get?
======================================================
Well there are many PCI motherboards available, the performance and features vary.
The most recommended PCI motherboard was the ASUS PCI motherboards (they use 
the SIS chipset).  It is supported by Linux and offers a good price and good 
features/performance.  One thing to be aware of is that the ASUS 486 PCI 
boards do not support the AMD 486DX/40 or the AMD486DX2/80.  I have been 
told to avoid the ASUS SP3 (without the G, the ASUS SP3G is the one you will 
generally find advertised on the 'net) also to avoid revisions older than rev 
1.7.  If you would like to contact ASUS directly, you can call them at 
408-956-9077.

Some general info about the ASUS SP3G:
The motherboard comes with 2 serial (both 16550 UARTs) and 1 parallel ports.  It 
also has an onboard NCR 53c810 SCSI controller (this is supported by Linux 
with a kernal patch). It has only 4 slots for 72-pin SIMMs, but a SIMM can be 
4, 8, 16, or 32 megs (for a max of 128 megs).  So get the densest ones you can 
afford.

Some other brands of 486 PCI motherboards that were recommended for Linux 
were A.I.R. 486 VP and Gateway 2000 486 PCI systems. 

Recommendations for Pentium PCI motherboards were ASUS, Intel, Gateway 
2000 Pentium PCI Systems, and Dell Pentium PCI Systems.

I would recommend buying through a dealer that will take back the motherboard 
if you are not entirely satisfied with it.  From the posts I received 
performance can vary greatly.  This can be a function of BIOS settings, 
however, some PCI motherboards do not perform as well as they should.  And you 
should definitely avoid any PCI motherboard that uses the OPTI chip set, its 
PCI bus is VERY slow.


Who is the author of this document?
===================================
I am Steve Henry. I am a senior in Electrical Engineering at Virginia Tech and 
I have been using Linux since 1992.  I am definitely not an expert on PCI, but 
I hope the information presented in this document can help others who are 
considering upgrades.  I have a lot of information on PCI graphics cards as 
well if the general public is interested on a document on that as well.  Feel
