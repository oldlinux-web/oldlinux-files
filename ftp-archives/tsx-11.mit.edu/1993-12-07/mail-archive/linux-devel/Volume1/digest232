My effort bombed out before that, still tracking down the problem. If you get the
thing to compile, perhaps you could put it on sunsite (some hints in a text file on
how you got it to compile might be a good idea too - I'd be interested anyway)

I'm currently working on an "mtools"-like package to access Mac disks
from Linux. Having used CAP & Access PC on the Macs, and other Unix systems,
you find that 99% of the time you don't care about the resource fork. 
So spending lots of time to make access to resource forks real easy by
creating a forked filesystem is a waste of time. I'll be using the CAP
approach, or something very similar.

Dereferencing a NULL pointer is, by definition, undefined.
(gotta love English :)
strlen is under no obligation to test for NULL; what should the
proper behavior be?  return 0?  No, an operation on the contents of
an undefined pointer is undefined.

Your environment is allowed to core dump, return 3, launch all missiles,
etc.

Hi all...

Just wanted to let you know, I'm working on getting this stuff moving...

It's not the simplest task to get a mailing list set up here at Ohio-State...
physically, it's as simple a task as anywhere else, but administratively,
it's kinda ugly ;)

So, what's going on is this:

I've applied for a mailing list to be created here at osu so that I can
be in charge of the thing...

I've applied for a bunch of drive space to put sources in as we create them
so that people can ftp them freely...

So far so good.  All seems to be progressing pretty well.. Hopefully
by the end of this week the mailing list will be goin', I'll have added
people, and we'll be plodding through the design asap....

Subject: Memory fixs :(
Date: Wed, 17 Nov 1993 08:08:02 GMT

Unfortunitly what seems to be the addition of checks for 
trying to allocate to much memory have some unfortunite
side effects. 
In Linux I've been taking advantage of the fact that 
allocating but not using large amounts of memory doesn't
have much overhead. For example allocating a 30 meg array
to handle variable sizes of incoming data without
frequent recopying. When doing this you want an absurdly
large size so that you don't run out of buffer, but now
it seems Linux deducts this from its "available space",
and won't allow you to allocate when the total exceeds
the available. 
In general this is a good thing, but it would be nice to
turn off on a job by job basis, and have a call that could
set the amount "reserved" for your job as your memory 
needs change.
For example you could also lower the amount after using unmap
to free "actual memory".

P.S. By actual memory, I mean pages that are in swap or physical
     memory rather than pages that will be created when accessed.

Most can -- but what about the firmware on the SCSI boards, if any?

The Alpha kernel already has the ability to send generic SCSI commands.
Receiving, i.e. target mode, would be a very good idea, if at all possible.

> How about a replacement for NFS? :-)

You don't need a file system for this. Just take a disk and use
one partition for a->b and another for b->a.  Managing free block
lists is left as an exercise (it's fairly easy, actually).

On the other hand, any bidirectional traffic means that the thing
would constantly be thrashing between these partitions. Using two
disks is a somewhat suboptimal solution.

The other problem is that you still need a way to notify B that A has just 
stored some data on the shared disk. Either you have target mode, and then
you don't need the disk, or you string a separate (serial? the SCSI bus has
a few spare wires anyway ;-) cable between the boxes and send a character.

That reminds me -- I had a massive differential SCSI cable between the living 
room and the kitchen (the disks were too loud and a long monitor cable gave a 
fuzzy picture) using twisted-pair flat cable. Ethernet between the two? Easy 
 -- grab two pairs of wire from the bus and run 10base-T. Serial? Another 
pair. The remaining two free pairs were used for the ISDN bus between the two 
rooms.  ;-)

There is a three month thread on the number of Bogomips of various machines.
It has about 30 differenct processors in it. Don't start it again. Please.

From what I remember a Pentium came in low (like 23 or something).
