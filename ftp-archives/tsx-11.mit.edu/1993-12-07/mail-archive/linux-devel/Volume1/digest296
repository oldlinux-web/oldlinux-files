Again, I said _different_ programs. For further discussion see

Typical. ``One of the assumptions behind GNU software seems to be nearly
unlimited resources.'' ---Tim Smith

Perhaps I should point out that I wasn't talking about just ``tar/cpio
type jobs.'' Your monster SuperArchiver application is just one of the
thirty programs.

For example, man pages are often compressed. Your SuperMan application
would undoubtedly have built-in compression and decompression, for the
same reason that your SuperArchiver does.

Now I say that you should take your 100K SuperArchiver and 100K SuperMan
and rewrite them as 70K wrappers around a common 30K compress program.
Boom. You've saved 30K of disk space, 30K of memory when both programs
are running, and ten or twenty milliseconds of startup time. _Plus_ you
get all the side benefits of modularity.

Now extrapolate this picture to thirty different programs, of which a
few use compress, a few use split, a few use sort, and so on.

This machine is a PC. It's got a few gigabytes of storage, spread over
several disks. I could add eleven more disks before running into any
problems. But wtf does this have to do with the discussion? Do you think
that the cost of memory is important only for PCs?

Hey, new ideas in program design! ``The bigger it is, the faster it
loads!'' [tee hee]

But, _except_ when you're running an I/O-bound tool on a big file, the
time for I/O is swamped by overhead. A compressing archiver is not an
I/O bound tool. Besides, as soon as you dump to tape, you're limited by
tape I/O, which is _much_ slower than pipe I/O.

I'll agree that modularity should be sacrificed for efficiency---but
only when it has to be.

> All of your arguments here are arguments AGAINST LINUX also,

No, they aren't. Do you care about the time to load Linux from disk? No.
Is Linux ever running together with another kernel, in a position to
share code? Of course not.

I said _different_ programs.

Oops, no, now I see the light. There _are_ no different programs. This 
one monster application puts together the compression and archiving and
splitting features _so well_ that _no other programmer_ will _ever_ want
to put the same features into a _new_ program.

Is that what you're saying?

Back to reality. There is, believe it or not, more than one monster
application in the world. For the same reason that _you_ throw _your_
set of small functions into _your_ big program, _other_ people throw 
_their_ sets of small functions into _their_ big programs. The result,
as I said, is thirty different programs, each eating a hefty chunk of
memory.

Subject: PAS16:scsi timed out
Date: 6 Dec 1993 13:48:31 -0500



Has anyone tried the ALPHA-pl13r kernel from nic.funet.fi with PAS16 soundcard 
and SCSI hard disk? 
When I tried to boot up with zImage (compiled from source ALPHA-pl13r
at nic.funet.fi, under directory /pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/pl13-ALPHA's,) 
it gave me a message "Patition check" and then hanged. 

Then, I turned off the option PEUDO_DMA in file linux/drivers/scsi/pas16.c
and recomiled it. This time, linux successfully reboot the system.

The next step, I did a fdisk to make two partition (each 200MB) 
on my scsi harddisk( seagate ST1480N 400MB). Linux did it happily. 
I reboot the system as instructed by fdisk, and tried to make a 
filesystem by using mke2fs.(I typed "mke2fs -c /dev/sda2 #blocks".) 

Now the wierd thing happened: 
after almost an hour, mke2fs finally finished and gave me following messages:

scsi host 0 timed out - aborting command. 
scsi host 0 abort() timed out -resetting
scsi disk error: host 0, id 0 , lun 0
scsi disk I/O error return code = 80000
dev 0802, sector 514    -----------------------
scsi host 0 timed out - aborting command      |
scsi disk error: host 0, id 0 , lun 0         |------> sector # difference is
scsi disk I/O error reutrn code = 30000       |    always 2.
dev 0802, sector 516    -----------------------

and the system hanged up. 

THen, I tried with different partition size with "mkfs",  and found out
that if the size is bigger than 17MB, I will get the same message  and
system hangs (except that sector # is different, but the difference between 
two sectors is always 2). But if I make a partition less than 17MB,
Linux can make a filesystem successfully by using "mkfs". 

By using mke2fs, and I can make  a filesystem with the size under 12MB. 
If the partition size is over 12 MB, I will get the same message and
system hangs. (I think these numbers--- 12MB, or 17MB ----depends on
CPU/ BIOS speed, not nesseary the magic number.) 

Also, if I reboot the system, and do a fsck -vf (or e2fsck -vf ) , I will
get following message:

the version msg. (junk)
Reading tables.
Inode bitmap for group 0 not in group (0)!e2fsck:descriptors corrupted
                                       ^
                                       |
                                sometimes is 1.



I think the problem is that the PAS-16 scsi disk driver does not give
enough time to let PAS-16 card to do its task, because I can make a 
"short"  partition but not a long one. 

I wonder 
      1) if anyone can tell me how to correct the problem.  
      2} if this is a  new problem, does any one can tell me how to change
         the time out algorithm for PAS-16 scsi disk driver.   
      3) what are the files related to the scsi disk driver for PAS-16?
         If the problem related to low-level part of the driver, or 
          medium part, or ???  

Any suggestions and ideas will be greatly appreciated.

                        jlli@cs.mtu.edu

P.S.: according to SCSI howto from tsx-11.mit.edu, the time-out can
caused by " IRQ, DMA, or address conflicts with other board."
However, my scsi disk works under msdos using trantor scsi-works. 
Also, I checked IRQ setting there is no obvious conflict. 

My system configuration is : 
        386sx40
        8Meg memory, (access speed 70ns)
        PAS16card  with seagate ST1480n harddisk.

The keyword here is "statically". The _only_ difference between binding 
statically and dynamically is that the static copy takes up more room in 
memory and on disk as soon as you have more than one Motif program running.

And, yes, you can upgrade your library (suppose Motif has bugs? Which get 
fixed??) without relinking all your programs. (Be aware that if you get 
the binaries over the network, you can't relink them.) But with the
current licensing scheme, that's not something which I as an end user 
have control over. Therefore I don't see why I should pay for it. Therefore,
I won't. Very easy. There are other toolkits which afford roughly the
same look and feel and which are not going to clog my clients' systems
with almost-identical but statically bound copies of themselves.

NB: Personally, I would hesitate to call a nonlinkable copy of a library 
(whether static or dynamic doesn't matter) a "runtime system".

Yes that's a way out but that some settings you can't change like this.
`stty -a' shows following values ( they don't seem to be good )
min 0 -hupcl -cread -brkint -ignpar

Subject: [Announce] Callback for Linux
Date: Mon, 6 Dec 1993 15:53:31 GMT

Heia:

This message is crossposted to c.o.l.misc and c.o.l.development, to reach a 
wide audience..

I recently uploaded my callback program to tsx-11.mit.edu. Basically, this 
program allows you to accept an incoming call on a Linux box with a modem. 
Instead of a login procedure, the `bogus login' asks you for a name and 
phone number to call back. The Linux box then dials that number, tries to 
establish a connection, and if that succeeds, starts a login shell. Great to 
cut your phone cost, if you have a modem at home and a Linux box at the 
office :)

The prerequisites for callback are:

(a) You must have a modem. Ha ha.. no, seriously.. you must have a PROPERLY 
INSTALLED modem.  That in turn means that you'll need the program setserial 
(2.0.2) and the program getty_ps (2.0.7b).  The modem must accept dial-in 
and dial-out calls.  

(b) You need the program callback. I don't know when it will be moved to an 
appropriate directory on tsx, but if you don't want to wait that long, get 
the following two files from beatrix.icce.rug.nl, directory pub/unix:

        callback-1.00.tar.gz    -   the archive with sources, docs etc.
        callback.doc            -   also in the archive: installation etc.

Hope you'll like callback. If so, drop me a note :) I am not posting 
callback.doc in this message; it's about 32K. Get it if you're interested.

Cheers,
Karel.

Most certianly, at the expense of shell script interpetation and 4
process slots.

There are _always_ trade-offs here, performance and ease of use vs size
portablility and configurability.  Personally I would rather just use
Ctar and type:

ctar cv6 [directory|file] [directory|file] ...

where "6" is defined in /etc/default/ctar as /dev/rfd0135ds18 with a
block size of 36 and 1440 blocks.  But hey ...

ctar is a whopping 69K binary.  Hell almost small enough to fit in my
old CP/M box.

You must compile with optimization ("-O") turned on in order for inline
functions like inb() and outb() to be expanded.  Otherwise you'll get
undefined function errors when linking your program.

Your program must call ioperm() or iopl() -- documented in the kernel hackers
guide -- with 'root' permission.  If you don't your program will fail at
run time with a segmentation fault.

If you use the slow versions, inb_p() or outb_p(), or explicitly call
SLOW_DOWN_IO you'll have to enable I/O access to not only your target device,
but also to location 0x80.

I haven't actually compiled DLXsim on Linux, but on a Sun... that was quite

YES! Bas is up and running again (using a smaller hardrdive and an Ygdr***

ftape 0.9.7 contains patches relative to pl14. IT WILL ONLY WORK WITH pl14!!!
- the ftape driver simply *checks* the kernel to find out if it's pl14 or not!
If you got the pl14a kernel, i've got a (dead simple) patch to cure the

Sounds great!

Please, please use a /proc/stats directory and submit the patches to Linus.
