I think, you misunderstood, what a list widged was made for.
If you have to implement a scrolled list with lots of entries,
you probably load these entries from a file or database. When I
had to work using motif, I had the same problem too, but not
so dramatic. I was not the programmer of that project, so I
was not able to change the structure. But the problem with
the scrolled list and other widgets is, that it seems to be unusable
for "almost unlimited" data. If you have to have a textediting
fieled, thad could contain data of only 30 Bytes, but also
5 MBytes, the contributed text editor widget also seems quite useless
to me. In the scrolled list or the texteditor, you only can see
a small part of the actual data, the user can select. So if you
have a widget, that contains only the visible Items, you can save
lots of memory. The problem, you will face, is the scrollbar.
The scrollbar does not have its information to display correct.
So you have to construct the interface from scratch using a single
scrollbar and a widget containing only the visible items. I do
not know of any sopport from motif, that helps me in modifying
this standard behavoir of the widgets.

But I am only a motif beginner, perhaps some advanced motif programmer
knows how to clone the scrolled list and how to modify it, so that
not all the data to be choosable, has to be resident in memory.

If there is no easy or practical sollution to this problem, this
is the point were a GUI toolkit implementing lots of interactive
widgets can loose its worth. The programmer has to deal with all
the details of the GUI again, if splitting up these compound
widgets. :-(

Nevertheless motif seems the only inteface to me, for programming
any application that needs a GUI. All the alternatives I saw,
exept OpenLook, are, in my opinion, not usable for someone who
only wants to implement a GUI. There are nice C++ libraries, but
the programmer first has to debug these libraries, if not only
linking them to the suppied demo programs. And I had comercial
libraried, that even did not work correct when linked to their
own demos. And OpenLook has failed to be accepted by the users.

BTW I do not want any discussion about comparing OpenLook to
motif. I think both are usefull for constructing a GUI, motif
has better acceptance and probably is easier to get.

I never saw any compyter which made it so easy to the user,
to modify the interface of a program, then the MAC. There are
applications out there, violating some...lots of the human interface
guidelines. But I was able to fix a lot of the violations, that
were only the choosing of a wrong symbol, wrong button labeling,
wrong button placement , wrong designed icons and lots more.
The tool for doing all of this is resedit. And you can get this
tool free.

I think you should be more careful with attributions. You have attributed
to me something that I did not say. Maybe you have a bug in your news

But binary distribution of software has its own minuses. The binary
distribution if PC software mad the viruses so popular. And binaries
often are bigger than source code, and a FTP archive archiving binaries
has to hold lots of versions, but on version of the source would be
sufficent. Updates have to be distributed as full binaries too, in
source form the diff can be quit short. And the net can help debuging
applications distributed in source. And what about the user of some
machines, that are not so popular as sun4, dec, hp. And the users
have diferent minds, of where to put support files (/usr/local/lib,
/opt, /usr/xxx). That leads to making a default installation, closing
the eyes, and living with the mess, just ignoring it. ( Oh, unix becomes
more like messy dos :-) ).

And think of all these programmers, who compiled and changed the source
of thhe programs to get them working in their environment. I personaly
learned a lot just from debuging sources, I found in the net or news.

I think binary distribution is _NO_ alternative to source distribution.

Date: Fri, 3 Dec 1993 17:35:16 GMT


Hi ALL !

I'm looking for alpha-testers and volunteers for a C-Borwser project. You should
be able to compile GCC 2.4.5 (that's the version, I have written patches for).
This means espacially that you should be able to get the sources (> 5 Megs
gzipped tar) and enought free disk space (> 40 Megs free).

However, if you do not, you can at least test the browser in demo-mode with given
demo-files provided.

People who like to port the patches to GCC 2.5.x  (x >= 5), are especially 
wellcome (don't worry, the patches are really minor (5154 _Bytes_ gzipped diff)

If you like to write additional browser-clients, please email too.

Eckehard Stolz
stolz@fiffi.sta.sub.org

============ parts of the README to c=bat=0.1b.tgz ===========
This is the README for the "C Browsing and Analysis Toolkit"
(c-bat) Version 0.1b (alpha) !

1. WHAT IS C-BAT AND HOW TO USE IT ****************************************

This tool is based on GCC 2.4.5 for Linux and is intented to help
programmers understand foreign (or their own :-) code by analysing
call-structures, use of variables, ...

It uses a client-server-concept where the server returns
information requested by client applications. Besides a single
example-client this toolkit provides a function library for 
retrieving information from the browser-server which can be
integrated in everyone's favorite programming environment.

First step is the compiling the project with a patched version of
GCC and the option "-aux-brs" (or "-aux-BRS"). This will generate
a browser-file for every source file with the same basename and the
extension ".brs" (e.g.  compiling "foo.c" will produce "foo.brs").
If you use the option "-aux-BRS" instead of "-aux-brs", symbols declared
in system-include-files will also appear in the browser file, 
otherwise system-symbols (mostly library-calls or library-variables)
will be ommitted.

After compiling, all these browser-files have to be combined by the
browser-collector (brs_collect). At the moment, this will just 
concat all browser-files together. If there exists allready a browser
file, existing old parts will be replaced by newer browser files.

This combined "project-browser-file" contains information about
function- and data-definition, function calls, include-files, ...
in a tagged ASCII-format (explanation of this format see below).

You can use now the "brs_client"-programm to retrieve information 
about the project by giving the appropriate commands. Please note
that this is not intented as high-quality end-user-tool because
normally everyone has his own favorite programming enviroment.
In fact, the functions provided with the toolkit makes it easy
to integrate the functionality of the brs_client into your own
environment (availability of C-source code assumed) .

Please regard brs_client as an example of the possibilities 
given by this toolkit. If you write some other useful clients,
please upload them to a appropriate ftp-site and send me an
email. Also, a sophisticated X-environment for a brs-client
would be something very nice and useful. So, if you like to
learn writing X-application and are looking for a challenge,
well, here is one !

After starting brs_client, you will see a menu with following 
options:

'F'  All functions in project
'V'  All variables in project
     All s(t)ructs, u(n)ions, enu(m)s, t(y)pdefs in project
'c'  All functions called by a function  ('C' for EVERY call pos.)
'u'  All variables used by a function    ('U' for EVERY usage pos.)
'b'  All functions calling a function    ('B' for EVERY calling pos.)
's'  All functions using a variable      ('S' for EVERY usage pos.)
'd'  Definition position of a function
'D'  Definition position of a variable
'i'  All include-files of a source-file
't'  Set new Timeout-Time
'a'  Get all messages in queue
'R'  New browsing-datafile
'k'  Kill server and exit
'q'  Exit client (not killing server)


Additionally, you can view the returned position in the sourcefile and
dump the returned information to a file.

[.... rest omitted ....]

Without thinking I would do something along the lines of

#! /bin/sh --
tar cvf - $HOME/ | (
        count=0
        while :
        do
                dd of=/dev/fd0a bs=1k count=1440
                echo "Backup of Volume $count done."
                count=`expr $count + 1`
                echo "Please insert Volume $count."
                read input < /dev/tty
                if [ "$input" = "quit" ]
                then
                        break
                fi
        done
)

I guess I can change it to terminate automatically if I switch
on my into the ON position.

At least this is UNIX: It CAN be done without using a compiler.

You're missing something.

I _don't_ want to have 20 copies of the Motif libraries lying around on disk 
or (worse) cluttering up main memory.  This is exactly what happens when you 
link Motif applications statically.  Note that you can't distribute a shared 
Motif library with your application.

Note, also, that it's impossible to write new Motif programs when all you 
have is the (runtime part of the) shared library; all the library gives you
is space saved on disk and in memory. Guess what? You still can't distribute
a shared Motif library.

This restriction hurts me personally, and absolutely nobody, including OSF,
benefits from it. I don't know about you but I refuse to pay anything at all 
to a company which promotes stupidity like that.
