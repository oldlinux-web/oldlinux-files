        Hi, linuxers!
                I read some post in comp.linux.announce in September ( I can't find the source now ),
 that somebody compiled package for dynamical linking ( GNU dld )on linux.
There were patches supplied. But when I compiledit it with those patches, it failed on the tests.
It seems that dld in its current form
doesn't know something about the structure of the linux libraries *.a ( I don't know either ).
There are two relevant questions:
1) Did anybody try to really port dld to Linux?
2) Is it possible to modify it for work with shared libraries?

This package allows installation( linking) of *.o modules to already working programs,
I would like to use it with fudgit ( statistics, smoothing , FFT, approximation C-like
interpreter ), which uses dld features on platforms supported by dld.

Yes, it exists. It is called selection, and I think the latest version is
1.5.  It used to require a kernal patch, but the selection support has been
built in to the kernel since pl10 or so.

Subject: new tty line discipline
Date: 6 Nov 93 16:40:50 GMT

Hi,

I added a new tty line discipline N_DCF (DCF is a german radio clock
transmitter) which inserts a time time stamp (struct timeval) after
each incoming  character. This is quite usefull for time
synchronisation to an external clock or radio clock receiver.

All comments on this topic and code are welcome,

Harald

Yes!  I have been toying with linux for the last week (for the first time,
coming from Esix SysV Rel3.2) and find it an excellent system.  I have
installed 386bsd in the past and found it a pain to co-exist ie partition with
other OS', unfamiliar file structure (my bias) and it kept dying on my SCSI HD
under load :-(.  I guess I like linux for several reasons:

  a: it's SysV
  b: it comes with X11r5 (compiled & source)
  c: it comes with gnu* (compiled & source)
  d: it comes with complete sources for everything
  e: it runs off a CD-ROM directly if you like to `preview'
  f: usenet software onboard (yet to configure...  I am posting from Esix)
  f: it supports all the cards I have `out of the box'
       ie: WD8013, Soundblaster, ET4000, Logitech Bus mouse, Scsi CD-ROM & HD
           (my setup)
  
I am basing my opinion on a CD Rom version that only has linux on it.  Can't
name the disk as I have installed and given the CD back to my friend.  Personel
experience only,  your milage may vary...  :-)

I don't know the answer for these questions, so I am cc-ing this to
comp.os.linux.development.

My gut feeling is that the linux kernel has too many Intel-isms to be
easily ported to any non-intel processor : the Amiga porting crowd may
have more help for you since they use a 680x0 processor too.

I suspect that the PowerPC version will have to wait until there are
a lot of those creatures about.

Has anyone solved this problem? I had the same experience - term worked
one day & didn't work the next. It's still dead.

Does anyone have a fix?

At 16550's, the FIFO was broken. Even National recommended _not_ to use
the FIFO of 16650 Chips. 16550A was bugfixed, so everything was fine. If
you are sure you have a 16550 (without the A), I'd rather replace it by
a 16550A (i.e. NS16550AFN, that's National's complete name for the chip).

HTH.

Here's a fix the problem.
Replace line 38 in misc.c, which was:
current_time = t.tv_sec * 20 + t.tv_usec / 50000;

with

current_time = (t.tv_sec & 0xffffff) * 20 + t.tv_usec / 50000;

Problem is t.tv_usec is currently around 0x2cdc459b, and will overflow
when multiplied by 20. I don't know why it was working before - I guess
it overflowed to a harmless number before, but now doesn't.

Subject: Joystick problems with PAS 16
Date: Sun, 7 Nov 1993 02:02:01 GMT


Hi... 

I'm experiencing some problems getting the joystick driver to work
with ALPHA linux 0.99.13p and the Pro Audio Spectry 16 card.  Still
have some hacking left to get the driver to understand my flight
stick, which looks like 1.5 joysticks. But, that's the fun part. :) 

The bad part is that the sound drivers for the PAS card seems to
disable the joystick port on the card. (Whenever I check the status of
the 0x201 port, all I get is 0xff). (Yes, the joystick is
connected... And this used to work for the driver I wrote under
NextStep). 

So, anybody know what to do ? I guess there is some bit in the IO_CONF
ports to the PAS that I need to set before it starts to read the
joystick. But as expected I cannot find anything about this in the
documentation for the card. (Nor can I find anything in the sound
drivers.)

Thanks for any help.
