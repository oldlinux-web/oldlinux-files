Couldn't have anything to do with agate being a machine the we actually use
here at berkeley (it's the main news server used by several thousand users
among other things).  

And what does it matter?  Did he say he was removing it from the net as a
whole?  Anyone who mirrors agate can set up their mirror not to delete
386bsd when agate does, if they want to.  You want it to stay around, start
talking to the admins of the mirror sites.

Subject: Building Mach 3.0 under Linux
Date: Tue, 2 Nov 1993 16:58:13 GMT

Hi there,

        I've finaly succeded in building the Mach 3.0 mk under Linux.
(Well, I think I have a usable microkernel.) BTW, sory to those who asked
me questions and to whom I didn't respond.

        Here is what I did. I hope this will help people who want to build
Mach 3.0 under Linux or some other platform.

        I've downloaded the Mach 3.0 mk with the buildtools and the i386
specific code. I've also downloaded the documentation. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE TRYING ANYTHING. 

        I then modified the setup.sh, bootstrap.sh and setvar.csh scripts
that come with the buildtools. I build the ode tools and then the all the
buildtools (rebuilding the ode tools in the process).

        I had to build xstrip by hand since the Makefile sets LPATH with
Mach libs before Linux libs. When you build xstrip with the makefile, it
link the object files with Mach's crt0.o. As you can imagine this leads
directly to a core dump when you try to execute xstrip. The solution is
either to patch the Makefile or to build it by hand.

        I tried next to build the mk. I had to change most "#ifdef
__386BSD__" in the lex scripts to "#if defined(__386BSD__) ||
defined(__linux__)" . I also patched one of the .mk file (of odemake) to
use libfl instead of libl. You can also make a symlink from libfl to libl.

        The next problem I had was with config. It dumped core at me every
time I tried to execute it. The problem was in the memory deallocation
algorithm in mkheaders.c (function doheader). The code dereferenced
pointers that were already deallocated. (In some OS that could work.) I've
replaced that code with a recursive deallocation algorithm.

        I then had to modify makeboot, in order for it to be able to
recognize a Linux binary. I had to change

        switch((int)x.image)       <or something like that>

        to 

        switch((short int)...

        in the exec.c file in kernel/src/makeboot/i386.

        With all those modification, I got odemake to procude a bootable
microkernel. I tried to load it with LILO but it didn't work. LILO loaded
the image and then returned to the "LILO boot:" prompt. 

        Now, how will I get the damn thing to boot? (Yes, I know I also
need a server if I want to do something useful with the mk.)

A la prochaine

This is the same argument for spending $3000 on a security system. Anyone
who really wants access can defeat the security. However it'll cost in time
and effort so to that. In the same vein anyone who really wants Linux access
can just bring their on Linux boot floppy to the party. 

The idea is not to allow for casual or easy access. Anyone who takes the time
to get ahold of the source code, modify it, recompile it, then run it can't
really be stopped anyway.

The bottom line, as stated before, is that anyone who has physical access
to any PC can get anywhere with enough time and effort. So the task is to
enforce that time and effort.

Good job so far.  Now you've come to the crux of the matter!

First, you need to check that all the little details are right.  Mach has
to be loaded at the right address and invoked in the right manner.  Mach is
expecting to be invoked in protected mode with valid segment registers set
up to a "flat" address space, and it is expecting parameters passed from
the boot program on its stack.  Look at the following files to piece
together how these parameters are pushed/popped/used:

        i386at/boot/asm.S
        i386at/asm_startup.h
        i386at/model_dep.c
        i386/setroot.c

You'll have to modify either your boot program or the Mach startup to
get the arguments differently.  Once you have that part in sync you
should be able to see Mach go through its initial device probe sequence.  

After the devices probe, Mach hands off to the bootstrap task, which was
connected to it by makeboot.  If makeboot wasn't modified correctly for
your Linux a.out format, the whole thing will go south at this point.

Then the bootstrap loader will try to open a paging file, and load and run
the first server.  For all that to work, the disk driver will need to
recognize the Linux partitioning system.  As is, it expects a BSD-ish label
on the disk somewhere (can be in a DOS partition) and takes its info from
that.  Of course, bootstrap will also have to understand your Linux
filesystems and a.out format, as will any Unix server you want to run.

Whew.  Good luck, you'll need it.  I know, I've been there. :-)

PRO
1. I like 386BSD . It works for me. I have had little or no problems with it.
   (once I got it installed)
CON
1. It does take a lot of hard disk space.
2. It attracts people who bitch and  complain alot.

I will be sorry to see 386BSD go. The departure does provide incentive
to move on...  to where:  FreeBSD, LINUX ????? 

Maybe this is natures way of telling us to get off our rears.

I totally agree: recently I got a core file from a 300K program with a
size of 14M (a image processing application) - dumped over NFS! (a cup
of coffee dump :-)) I never care about core files as I did not yet
face a situation when I cannot replicate an error with a debugger
running and controlling the process. Even if such a situation would
arise, the core file is just one sample of a erroneous run, and you
are unable to deduce the reasons of the bug from the core file, you
must see the program running into the error.

As a matter of fact (as my debugger always tries to load a file core,
if existing, when I want to debug a program, and sometimes it is from
a different program or an older version, so I have to remove it to
proceed), core files are just like MSDOS: things that get in your way.

Some shells allow disabling core dumps. Just do it.

Subject: idea for TERM client
Date: Wed, 3 Nov 1993 00:32:19 GMT

The recent TERM upset got me thinking about term clients and I came
up with one.  Maybe this is old news but here goes:

The new client, called trestart, would awaken a sleeping term and 
get it to reopen the serial ports that it was using before. 

The trouble is that I get phone calls while I'm terming into work
and all the shells I have get destroyed.  What would be really cool
is if term could trap SIGHUP and instead of shutting down, close the
serial ports and wait for a wake-up message.  This way all the term
clients could just hang until the serial connection gets 
re-established.  Sort of like NFS mounted drives not being accessible.

Anybody know if this has been done?

Date: Mon, 01 Nov 93 20:01:59 GMT


    The real complaint, as I see it, is not that "core.imagename"
is a bad idea, but that it makes it impractical to write simple
scripts that will delete core.* files.  (As stated by others,
core.c, core.h, and core.5 are files that should not be
deleted gratuitously.)  I too am not in favor of trying to
use special characters to delimit the file name.  It will
confuse too many users.

    How 'bout this?  Instead of creating a core.imagename
file, write it as core.-imagename.  Yes, it is an extra
character, but ".-" is not a common character sequence in files.
In fact, there were no matches for *any* filename containing the
character sequence ".-" on three different computers (running
Linux, SunOS 4.1.3, and Solaris 2.2).

   Surely, then, a statement of 'rm core.-*' would be
acceptable in scripts.

Just a thought,

I've really not been concerned with this issue, and maybe this method
for deleting core files under the current naming scheme (core.imagename)
has been mentioned, or maybe it has some ridiculously obvious disastrous
result, but how about:

rm `find . -name core\* -exec file {} \; | grep "core file" | sed -e "s/:.*$//"`

here's a step-by-step example:

{~}: find . -name core\*
./core.a.out
./core.c
{~}: find . -name core\* -exec file {} \;
./core.a.out: core file (Linux)
./core.c: ascii text
{~}: find . -name core\* -exec file {} \; | grep "core file"
./core.a.out: core file (Linux)
{~}: find . -name core\* -exec file {} \; | grep "core file" |sed -e "s/:.*$//"
./core.a.out
{~}:rm `find . -name core\* -exec file {} \;|grep "core file"|sed -e "s/:.*$//"`
{~}: find . -name core\*
./core.c

On some of the longer lines above I took the liberty of removing some
blanks so it wouldn't line-wrap on an 80 character screen.  Don't blame
me if I deleted something important.

And don't get the idea that I actually *use* this.  But feel free to tell
me what's dangerous about it.  I guess it's pretty obvious that it will
fail if the file name has a colon (:) in it.  So if the binary was named
"c:" and it dumped core, then the core dump would be named "core.c:", and the
above would remove "core.c" instead of "core.c:".  Whoops.  But then
again, I gave up using c: when I gave up using dos.  But for those of
you who don't want to take the chance, then how about:

rm `find . -name core\* -exec file {} \; | grep "core file" | sed -e "s/: core file (Linux)$//"`

Yeah.  That's the ticket.  OK, fire away.  Tell me what I've overlooked
with that one.

And if you somehow manage to recursively delete every file on your system,
please send me a polite message detailing your experience. :-)

I disagree. Such a program will have limited use, and may not justify
the cost of implementing one.

The security issue is an issue only if there is pretty *easy* access to
access/modify the linux files i.e. if I leave the machine
for some time (say few hours) no one should be able to quickly come and
access/modify important files within linux file system. 

Here at our place, the many floppy drives have physical locks.  That was
the only solution we found that served the purpose! 

So my suggestion is to go in for file-system like interface. A device
driver/ TSR will be loaded on bootup, which will allow controlled access
to linux file system.

So you would initially 'login' giving the password. Then you use 'map'
to mount required linux directories as dos drives -- much the same as in novel 
netware.  I feel that the main advantage is in controlled access to files and
programs on per user basis in DOS.

And it will also open up plethora of application software for say
configuration etc. etc.

*********Now some happy news: *****************

A friend of mine is trying to develop a NFS client for DOS as part of
his undergraduate project. He has already implemented many dos file
system calls so that the C: drive can also be accessed as other F:, G:
etc.  drives, with their default working directories. The project will
take on a full swing in December vacation.

Though the above said functionality is a deviation, he will be happy to
offer the code for dos side of filesystem interface. Someone can then
use this code + linux kernel code for filesystem to give the above said
functionality in pretty less amount of time.
