I don't think this is possible because much X programming consists of
using standard functions (such as XtSetValues) on non-standard data
structures (i.e widgets). You will need to supply the `include' files
which define the widgets and the application programs will need to be
recompiled.

In order to get application software to work you do not need to copy
the appearance of Motif -- only the functionality. Making this distinction
might help to reduce the effort involved. I read that there are 75 pages
of reference information in the "OSF/Motif Programmer's Reference" for
the XmList widget alone. You clearly need all the simplifications you
can get.

There appears to be some confusion in some people's minds between
window managers and clients. In general, the widget set used for the
client has no bearing on the choice of window manager. There are two
reasons why this is not entirely true:

a) The client may expect certain functions to be carried out by the
   window manager. These may vary between one style guide and another.
   I do not have access to the Motif Style Guide but I suspect that
   this is not a significant problem. For example, if the style guide
   prescribes that the window menu provides the method of closing the
   application then this function may be missing from the application
   itself.

b) Mixing applications and window managers based on different widget sets
   means that there is less opportunity for shared libraries to conserve
   memory. X applications in general, and Motif in particular, tend to
   be slow because of huge memory requirements.

Perhaps the solution is to persuade people who are writing software for
Free distribution (in the GNU sense) to avoid using Motif in the first
place.

This thread started with a desire to be able to use software written
for Motif without having access to the Motif libraries. I would like
to suggest an alternative project: how about producing a widget set
that would allow developers to produce applications consistent with
the look-and-feel of Motif so that such applications could co-exist with
commercial applications? Do we really need software that requires 75
pages of reference documentation to describe a simple operation?

With X programs in general?  You can't.  You'd have to move the entire X state
of the client (not just "window"!  Remember, a scrollbar is a separate window.
And possibly more than one window under XView or Motif.  And a client can have
more than one top-level window).  This includes GCs (well, GContexts),
colormaps, etc.  (which I will collectively refer to as "resources", meaning
SERVER resources, not the stuff you put in /.Xdefaults.)

And what do you do if there isn't a compatible visual on the other system?
Move a window tree with an 8-bit PseudoColor visual to a screen which only has
a 1-bit StaticGray visual?

Now, in theory an extension to Xlib could be developed which would download
the client's entire set of resources from the server, sever the connection,
connect to the server on the other screen, and upload the resources.  It could
query the new server for available visuals, choose the most compatible one,
and adjust the resources to be uploaded to be compatible with the new server.
A lot of work.  And probably a failure:

(1) who defines "compatibility"?  An 8-bit PseudoColor to 1-bit StaticGray
mapping that will work for xterm won't necessarily work for xv.  And different
people --- or different displays --- may want different mappings when moving
xv in that fashion.

(2) how do you re-share resources?  A resource the client was using on the
original screen may have been shared with other clients on the screen.  In
particular, if a program uses CopyFromParent for a window attribute when
creating a window, then downloads that attribute from the server to move the
window, it won't get CopyFromParent back... it'll get whatever the value was
that was inherited.

(3) What if some resource --- a font, a cursor, whatever --- needed by the
client to be moved isn't available on the new server?  Reconnect to the old
server and download it?  (ugh)  ---And what happens if it's a scaled font and
the new server doesn't have font scaling compiled in?  Or you're moving it
from a Sun with xnews's font format?

I somehow doubt we'll be seeing this capability for X windows in general any
time soon.  (Of course, if someone would like to prove me wrong... :-)

Nope.  In fact, several apps using the Motif widget set have specifically been
statically linked for Linux, so people can use them without having to buy
Metrolink's package just to run the binaries they've pulled off tsx-11 or
sunsite.

Here are some notes I took when I was beta-testing xvtdl-5.0 (I think
most were still valid for the final release):

========
Imakefile
        Commented out the line that reads "SVR4LIBS = -lintl".

gfm.c
        Stole regexp.h from a Sun to get compile() and step().

gcm.c
        #ifdef'd out strcasecmp() for Linux.

xdefaults.c
        Modified an #ifdef to #include <unistd.h> for Linux (to get
        the definitions for F_OK and R_OK).

lex.yy.c
        Don't use the original.  Copy lex.yy.c-8bit-kludge to lex.yy.c
        and add the following line:

                #define yywrap() 1

        Tried using flex, both with no options and with the -8 option; neither
        worked.
========

As I recall, I had some trouble with lex.yy.c in the final release that I
didn't have with the beta.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to provide any
more help, because I'm moving soon and will probably have lost my account
by the time you read this.

Motif is not only a window manager, but a GUI specification.  There is an
API that is used for programming applications that fit the Motif GUI spec,
and it is the fact that money needs to be paid out to get this library that
is the reason why a number of people want to work on a freely distributable
version of the motif developement libraries.

Nope.  When I buy commercial X stuff for my SPARC running X11R5, I am
often asked whether I want the OpenWindows or Motif versions.  I
usually get the statically linked Motif version.  I don't have
OpenWindows or Motif libraries, but I do run Motif applications -- but
I can't compile them!

        Emacs 19 is supposed to be able to close itself from one server and
re-open to another server. I haven't had any success yet. It'll be nice if
I can re-open emacs from my SPARC to my Linux machine over TERM and
re-connect itself to the SPARC if the phone hangs up. Has anybody tried
that?

Of course this problem is much more difficult to handle with X-windows because
of many of the environmental concerns that Brandon brought up, but I can think
of at least one environment that does this pretty well:  Macs.  In some
ways it's like comparing apples and oranges, because you can't move a
a window from _one machine to another_- but individual machines can have 
multiple displays you can move windows, and the mouse pointer across.  It's one
of the capabilities I've always liked in the make environment.  It would be
neat if the X environment had software extensions to allow us to do something
like this.  I wonder if the X consortium would consider adding this to the 
next release after X11R6.

No...

J> A 42k file WILL consist of 8 full blocks followed by 2 fragments.

No, it will consist of 5 8KB (always assuming an 8KB/1KB fs, instead of
any other more or less plausible one) full blocks plus a 2KB fragment; a
2KB fragment is not just 2 consecutive 1KB fragments.

Thus the 1KB (in an 8KB/1KB fs) usually mentioned as the "fragment size"
is actually the "fragment granularity".

The FSS must keep separate lists of free fragments for each of the 8
possible fragment sizes; if the list for the fragment size one need is
empty, a full block (or a larger fragment) is broken in two; the two
parts are added to the free list for the appropriate fragment
size. There might well be many 1KB fragment free, but no 2KB fragment
around.

The same is true in memory, with the modifications to the availability
of VM (if the VM page size is equal to the fragment granularity one only
needs a single size of buffers, or perhaps two, as one can make
virtually contiguous the granules of a fragment that are physically
discontinuous).

Just to bury once and for all all this nonsense about blocks and
fragments, as if Eric Youngdale's work were not enough, I will mention
here the really terrifying details of the consequences of the FFS
fragmentation scheme on incore buffers -- if you are under 18 years of
age, or you are impressionable, or suffer from a weak heart, don't read
on.


You were warned!


Ok, most files grow by appending at the end of the file. Suppose the
file size starts such it is an even multiple of 8. One byte gets
written: the FFS buffer manager finds a 1KB buffer and puts the byte
into it. Now 1024 bytes are appended. The buffer manager finds a 2KB
buffer, and moves the byte in the old 1KB buffer, plus the new 1024
bytes, into it.

Every time 1KB more are written, a buffer with the larger size is
allocated, the contents of the previous buffer are moved to the new
larger and so on. This sad thing happens for all blocks that make up a
file, as they are filled they grow from a 1KB frgament to a full 8KB
block (if ever), KB by KB.

When the buffer that overflows is finally 8KB long, or the file is
closed, space for it is allocated on disk, and it scheduled for writing
to that space. If the space requested is a full 8KB long, a full block
is allocated; if it is 1-7 KB long, the "free list" on disk for that
size is searched; if it is empty, a larger fragment or a full 8KB block
will be split; as in a 6KB free fragment being split into say one 4KB
free and one 2KB newly busy ones.

If you have VM pages that are <= 1KB then growing an N KB incore buffer
into an N+1 KB buffer can be done without copying by changing page
tables.

If VM pages are large, as on a Sun3, for example, one might consider
copying things around every time a block grows, which is impossibly
expensive (for each 8KB written to a file, the first 1KB gets copied 7
times, the second 1B gets copied 6 times, and so on...).

The alternative is to resort to using 8KB buffers thruout, which is is
only very expensive, as many files are way smaller than 8KB, so the
amount of memory devoted to buffers will be in general wasted for well
over 50% of its capacity, but this for one thing did not trouble the Sun
people, who has ensured that in general memory was over 50% wasted in
internal fragmentation anyhow.

Now does anyone see why a block/fragment scheme is crazily complicated?

The OSF/Motif specification has been submitted for fast-track approval as an

and looks to be on track for approval early next year.

        The problem with this idea is that while the disk controller
knows everything about the disk, it doesn't know anything at all about
the filesystem structure.  Said fs structure information becomes
necessary to do cylinder grouping, etc.  If the OS can do
cylinder/head/sector positioning, it can make much more intelligent
choices about what to put where than the controller hardware can.
Take as an example a filesystem doing striping in software, if the
disk controller remaps your request to somewhere else on one drive,
but not on the other, you've lose a lot of the benifit.
