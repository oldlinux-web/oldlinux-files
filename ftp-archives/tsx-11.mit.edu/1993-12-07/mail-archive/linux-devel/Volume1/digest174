I agree with Tim's idea. I've heard talk before about doing all sorts of
crazy stuff to the Linux kernel to manage Mac resources and treat files
like macs do, and so forth. I find the idea very distasteful. I'd vote for
the file.r, file.d, file.i design -- that should be sufficient for
grabbing fonts, text, and so forth. If ya need to pick apart the resource
fork then someone could  write a resource decompiler like the windows
folks use, just don't stick it in the file system code.

My two cents,

SMIT is very nice for the mundane sysadmin work such as manipulating
users, a lot of NFS work, most filesystem stuff, etc.  However, I think
the reason it is perceived as a monstrosity is that even though it is a
very happy mask over the operating system administration, AIX
administration used to be a fairly hideous beast to begin with (still
is, sorta).  Couldn't mask the entire ugliness.  :)

I wouldn't follow the SMIT UI to the letter, however.  It's basically
just a simple hierarchical menu system which turns leaf nodes into
short scripts.

Unfortunately, you can tell that the tty version was written by guys
used to working on IBM mainframes.  Has that gruesome screen-oriented
feel to it.  Uses F-keys, too, which I've always distrusted as part
of a tty interface for some reason (some kind of brain damage?).

If you've mailed me recently asking for a copy of the driver for a

      I have been following the thread about reading the FAQs before posting.
   I have done so, and keep an (out of date) copy nearby. However, as was

   a definite lag between a problem being fixed and appearing in a FAQ.

     I have a possibility which may help people to search the FAQs easier
   (500k chews up anyones time) and thus may cut down the 200+ linux

      If any of you have read the GNU jargon file, you know its HUGE :-)
   you may also have come across the jargon file viewer also available from
   GNU (vh-1.5.tar.gz - compiles with the -traditional flag) which treats the
   jargon file as a hypertext document, allowing you to follow a thread of
   information.

      I would like to see this method used for linux documentation too.

eric@tantalus.nrl.navy.mil (Eric Youngdale) is working on a texinfo
verion of some of HOWTO/FAQ stuff. This is probably a more appropriate
hypertext system.

But a hypertext version is unlikely to cut down lazy posts. With the
exisiting FAQ one can often guess a few keywords from the lazy ********s
Subject: lines and find the answer in the FAQ in <30s using the emacs
incremental search. I doubt any hypertext system could reduce this time.

Not quite! I am told that the bsd folks are/have been considering some sort
of dynamic /dev. This is basically the same idea but they thougth one step
further: Make the kernel configure itself! This way only the needed drivers
are included and the drivers take care of generating the /dev entries.

I though about it too. My idea was:
- Introduce a boot-FS like SVR4 et al.
- Do not generate a monolitic kernel. Instead build binary modules which can
  be dynamically linked with the core system. This way hardware vendors can
  contribute binary only versions of their drivers. ( I don't like this, but
  it would definetly help Linux: See the Diamond story ...)

Technically a boot procedure would look like this:
        bootloader
        Linux core
                Call driver 'abc'
                        Check if hardware present
                        Yes -> Initialize driver and create /dev entries
                        No  -> Cleanup and exit.
                Call driver 'def'
                        ...
        Mount root-FS
        Mount proc-FS (no need for a fstab entry!)
        Mount dev-FS (see above)
        Switch to user-mode and execute /sbin/init.

This can be done in a transparent way so that applications still see a Unix-
like system.

Nice idea, but don't ask me to implement it: I definitely don't have the
necessary skills :(

WARNING: QUESTION AHEAD........

I have made an utility that converts an X font into the font format
used by "fntpak01" by Jerry Kaidor <jkaidor@synoptics.com>, written
in PERL.

(Before you bother sending me mail about it:
ftp://aun.uninett.no/pub/misc/bdf2fontpak)

Now, questions two:

1) Will the console patch that allows font loading enter the "standards
   track" of Linux any time soon?

2) If not, is anyone working on an alternative mechanism?

For the reason for my interest, see my .sig. The ø shows up as a
square box on unmodified Linux, because IBM forgot about Norway and
Dennmark when designing the original PC.

Subject: SysV IPC system-wide limits?
Date: Tue, 19 Oct 1993 12:08:40 GMT

Hi everybody!

I'm developing a dbm which should be able to do some fast IPC.
No I arrived at the problem the SysV IPC has some arbitrary 
systemwide limits like the max number of message, etc.

The problem is to find a way for the client not to overload the
message-system, keeping the server some space to answer pending
request and not to deadlock!

The way I actually use is to idle loop around a msgctl IPC_STAT
which is definitely not acceptable.


Has anybody any idea how to unlimit the IPC this way?
Btw. what kinds of limits apply to the ipc. 
I found msg/system! Are the limits like msg/user or
msg/client, too ?

Is there any documentation about SysV-IPC apart from the manpages?


Please send any answer by E-Mail because I don't read all the
groups I crossposted to regularly!

In case you don't read comp.unix.misc, Novell has transferred the

the X/Open spec 1170.  Spec 1170 is FTPable from "uiunix.ui.org" as

        I also would like to raise the same point.  The fontpak patches to
console.c could easily be made part of the standard kernel without
adding too much to the kernel's size; they're not that big.  Having fonts
as part of the standard kernel would be a very good thing, since programs
could just assume the capability was there; if the kernel didn't contain the
font code, it could just gracefully ignore the 8192 bytes of font data
sent to it.  This would mean that TTY games could use their own custom
font (ah...reminds me of my Commodore days...), and applications could also
look a _lot_ more interesting.  I would love to have a sysadmin script system
that looked as professional as the Norton Utilities do.

        So, I agree that VC fonts should become part of the standard Linux
kernel.

For any of this reader stuff to work, it would have to be as easy as
posting to the net.

It's as simple as that.

If it takes them 3 min to type in an article, then the system needs to be
easy enough for them to get an answer in 3 min.  And the answer needs to

Ok.. here's the situation:

Sunday night (the day the new c libraries were sent out), I installed
ld.so.3 and libc 4.4.4.  This should include the new include files,
the extra-xxxx and the image-4.4.4.  I did this after I installed ld.so.3
and then installed the new g++ stuff.  Basically I installed anything
that looked like part of the upgrades announced in comp.os.linux.announce.

Everything works fine except for seyon: 

Upon loading seyon everything pops up fine, but upon klicking on any
button in the control box I get a sig11 error from seyon.  Now I KNOW signal
11 is supposed to be a memory error.  But before installing libc4.4.4
I had no such error EVER with seyon.  It is no an error that will   
happen every time seyon is loaded.

The only system changes were the installation of libc, lib.so.3,
and recompiling linux 0.99.pl13 with the new libraries.

Has anybody else had this problem?

Just thought I'd bring it up.

Thanks for the info; I've had a quick look - see and found that it

...what do you think the Linux kernel does now?  Of course, all the probe
