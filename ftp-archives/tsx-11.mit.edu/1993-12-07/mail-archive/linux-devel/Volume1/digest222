Personally, i prefer fvwm, and believe it to be the window manager of
choice for this project on the basis that it looks virtually identical
(within tolerances) to mwm.  I didn't personally like gwm when I tried
it a few months ago.  It just doesn't do much for me (sorry).

It could, but it HAS to be a drop in replacement, or I'm just wasting
my time writing YAWS (yet another widget set).

No. Each COM port eats 8 IO slots. There are 1024 total available on the ISA
bus and other devices must live on the bus also. In addition you only have
8 slots. 

The current config of serial ports on a PC will only support 8 serial lines.
With specialized hardware (usually external to the PC) this can be bumped up.

Depends on the motherboard and memory. About $1300 for a 486DX40 with 16M
RAM with case and power supply, floppy and ENET card.

Yes. In fact it's possible to drom the loader on an EPROM and totally bypass
the floppy and have a totally diskless station. The Hardware is the problem

My interesst is not in performance or reliability.

I'm using a RS232 line to connect a radio clock receiver which sends
one character per second at 50 baud. To adjust the UNIX clock as exact as 
possible it is important to know the exact time of the rising edge of the
signal (which is detected as start bit). with the current UARTs I only get
a resolution of 1.25 ms which isn't god enough. 

with some external logic it would be possible to use higher baud rates
but this would result in loosing some of the nice features of the 
50 baud solution.

That's right. BSD-FFS uses this info to do some elaborate guessing at
the optimal rotational position where to continue allocating blocks for
a file after stepping to a different cylinder. Without this information
no harm is done, maybe the FS performance is a nifty bit less than
optimal.

>(And it was pointed out in a followup article that most newer drives use

And you can try to fit your partition in one of these zones and go with
the sector numbers of this zone.

Subject: Kernel output to /dev/tty0
Date: 9 Nov 1993 13:40:21 GMT

        Hi all,

        Last week I have tested robustness of my kernel (ALPHA-pl13p)
using "crashme" utility. This program was able to kill/panic/shutdown/crash
any of systems I know -- e.g SCO, AT&T SVR3, SUN OS 4.*.*, {NET,386}BSD
in few minutes.

        My linux kernel DIDN'T CRASH for 6hours (!). (Then I've kill all
"crashme"s running on my system). But there was one very unpleasant thing:
All messages about illegal FPE instructions, etc. from kernel was written
to active virtual console :-((((. On some systems (AT&T SVR4, NetBSD with
syscons console driver, ...) kernel output goes to one VT (ususally
/dev/console or /dev/vt0 or something that).

        And therefore I decided to make some patch to kernel to
enable kernel output to /dev/tty0. In console.c I changed only
console_print() in console.c and panic() in panic.c -- panic()
should change active vt to /dev/tty0 before kernel enters
an infinite loop at the end of panic().

        Comments, bug fixes (if any :-), etc welcomed by E-mail.

NOTE: -- My kernel didn't crash possibly because it is _very_ small:
        No network, no SCSI, no soundcards configured in kernel.

If the overhead of reading one block at a time is large enough, you
won't be able to read consecutive sectors.

how much data should be read at one time depends on how much free
memory you currently have.  If you have 1MB of free memory, go ahead
and read 128k.  If memory is tight, only read 8k...  This is something
that can't be accurately guessed at when you are building the file
system.  You should check it at run time.

It was my understanding that framents were used only when the entire
file was 1k or less, but you may be right that it is used for the
tails of all files.  I am fairly sure that you can't uses multiple
fragements though, so a 42k file would not be able to use 2
fragements.

Not if you make the allocation size as small as the fragement size.
If you do that, then you won't get any more wasted with a
non-fragmented filesystem.

The hard disk that has my data is currently in the mail to Quantum to
get fixed.  *sigh*.  Sorry, all I have is my memory.  Note, that I
didn't say that 8k would get really bad throughput, just that reading
an entire track at a time can get better performance than reading just
8k. 




Basically, my point was that fragments get you nothing that just
clustering reads and writes can't also get you.  Clustering is simpler
to implement, wastes less disk space and can get even better
performance.  This was all discussed recently in comp.arch.storage...

        and re-created a few sym-links....) Anyrate this is great and 
        dandy. It compiles nice and clear, as long as I do not try to and
        in the SB drivers. I am using snd-driv-2.0.tar.gz for sunsite. 
        Anyrate, all I really want to know is if that have been know 
        problems comiling this with 99p13?

        Anyrate, let me try it again, I have a dew ideas on what the 
        problem is. Thanks!

OSF has given resp. will give (I'm not quite sure) the Motif *specification* to
X/OPEN. That means, Motif will be an open standard. Everybody who wants can get
the specification and implement his own Motif.

  I have a version of DIP I modified which has extra script functions to both
grab the IP address off of a dynamic server (it grabs it from the serial
stream, this is not a bootp implementation) and implements lock files.  If
anyone is interested, let me know and I'll send it to you.

Does it exist a threads package on Linux ?

I need something like pthreads. The scheduler must be preemptive.

Which is the whole point of the rotdelay parameter, which is to tell the
driver how long it takes the disk to be ready for another transfer, after
the end of one.

This seems like a waste of time, and certainly adds more overhead,
especially on a heavily used machine.

Seems like if the allocation size is small, you add mucho more data that
has to be kept track of, more inodes for all those blocks, more
chains of inodes to follow, seems like for big, big files you would
need quadruple indirection, etc.  

Kind of sounds like you think the DOS FS is the way to go...
