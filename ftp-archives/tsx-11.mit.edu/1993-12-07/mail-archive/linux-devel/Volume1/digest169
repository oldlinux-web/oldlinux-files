How about making each Mac file appear to be three unix files?  Mac file
"foo" would appear under unix as "foo" (the data fork), "foo:r" (the
resource fork), and "foo:i" (the Finder information).

hmm.  A/UX does something like:
        foo             data fork
        %foo            resource fork

and i dunno what for the finder info...

it'd probably be a good idea to follow the A/UX convention --
it's a unix on the mac and i for one would like to see
the mac port of NetBSD be as A/UX compatible in terms of things
like *that* as possible...  (but no, i don't want NetBSD to become
svr2...  *chuckle*  8-)

Do you get something like,

tar (child): can't write to /dev/ftape : Timer expired

This is what I always get, but after 20 _minutes_ of using tar czf
/dev/ftape to backup my system.

Also, does anyone have a working "mt"?  The mt included with SLS doesn't
seem to work with my Conner C250MQ.  "mt fsf" just causes the drive light
to flash once.

tar rf doesn't work either.  I get an error message telling me that I
may have to use --ignore-zeros to read it back, and that doesn't work
cleanly either.

Can someone please advise me as to where the

I am currently running SLIP with 0.99pl10 (I am very new at
this Unix stuff and 0.99pl10 is running reasonably well
most of the time so don't want to rock the boat), and while
results have been reasonable there are a few random problems
(crashes, panics, fragmentation problems, general sluggish
and not-terribly-reliable SLIP performance), and I would
like to upgrade to the latest stable version.

OTOH if frag/defrag isn't in yet I may wait.

I have the latest-as-of-two-weeks-ago SLS and Slackware
versions, but my experience with SLS is that it's a bit
behind the, uh, cutting edge of development around here.

Are you sure that only 800k's would work?  I have a dos program
'mac-in-dos' that reads, writes, formats, and converts on 1.44's.  I've never
yet had a problem with it.  I'm not sure what method they employ, but I
would think that it would be reproducable under linux....

This is AppleDouble format, and the finder info is included in the %foo file.

If you do it that way, you'll get the added benefit of being able to export 
the Mac filesystem via NFS... there's at least one NFS client for the Mac 
(NFS/Share) which understands AppleDouble.

The Apple HFS stuff is described in Inside Mac:Files; AppleDouble is 
available electronically.

The Mac directory is organized as a B*-tree. Therefore, it'll probably be too 
much work to write a read/write HFS simulation. Read-only should be fairly 
easy. In fact, I've once written a small program to extract files from a 
semi-corrupt HFS disk (just one of these quick hacks, but the tape drive was 
with a friend and this way was faster ;-) which I can mail to anybody who is 
_really_ interested in pursuing this.

Next step: Make Linux understand Apple's partitioning scheme and directly 
mount Mac disks and CD-ROMs... next step: implement the BSD FFS so that I can 
reuse the big FTP archive disk which now hangs off the A/UX machine without 
reloading everything from tape...

Actually, A/UX does not provide unix support for the Mac filesystem.
Files on a Mac partition are only accessible from the A/UX Finder and
from Mac programs.  Unix programs do not see files on Mac partitions.
Thus, A/UX does not really answer the question of what a Mac file
on a Mac partition should look like to unix programs.

Hmm.  It's a bit more complicated than that on A/UX.

  Mac files stored on an A/UX partition (presumably with the intent of being 
accessed by the MacOS environment that runs under A/UX) can be in one of
two formats, AppleSingle and AppleDouble.  

  AppleSingle format has all the information for a Mac file "foo" stored in a
single Unix file "foo"; the resource fork and finder info appear first,
followed by the data fork.  

  AppleDouble format has the data fork for the Mac file "foo" stored in the
Unix file "foo", without any stray headers on it.  The resource fork and
finder info are stored in the file "%foo", as you mentioned.  

  AppleDouble is arguably the more convenient format for dealing with from 
Unix-side apps.  For files like .gif or other platform-independent formats,
all the information a Unix app would want to deal with would be in the 
data fork, and hence in the Unix-side file "foo", with no Mac-specific resource
fork goo cluttering the picture.  If you're planning on making an HFS 
filesystem for NetBSD, it'd probably be best to have it present the Mac files
in AppleDouble format.  (Just FYI, A/UX doesn't let you mount HFS filesystems
on the Unix filesystem tree; the only way to dink with HFS filesystems is 
through Mac apps such as Finder running under the MacOS environment of A/UX.)

  The specs for AppleSingle and AppleDouble format should be available 
somewhere, probably on ftp.apple.com.  There's currently a discussion ongoing
in comp.mail.mime on how to best handle including Macintosh-specific files
in MIME messages, and the formats they are planning to use are AppleSingle and
AppleDouble.

Agreed.  Especially about it not becoming SVR2. :-)

Ah, the Mac disk thread again! ;) If the speed changing disks for the Mac 800K 
format use speed <= normal speed of a PC drive, you could just turn on and 
off the floppy drive motor by toggling the control bit really fast. Higher 
duty cycle (% on), higher speed. It would be a trouble to calibrate, might 
act different on different drives (different speed vs duty cycle curve, 
might not work well, could possibly hose the drive (?), etc).

Linux has very fast interrupt handling, you could probably hook into the 
timer irq after upping the rate (ala the way the PC speaker device driver 
works)
