I saw this done with x11r4 and was told it was pretty much a compile
switch.  Multiple monitors, that is.  Scroll your cursor back and
forth between monitors, etc.  Isn't this what the display:0.x is for?

I'd be interested in some work arounds for these system calls if anybody

    Hmm.. interesting idea, but unless you use the NMI you will not get much
    better then 500uS or so, and the worst case response time is probably
    greater then a 1 mS anyway due to the way the interrupt subsystem works
    and the massive amount of disabling of interrupts that occurs in the 
    kernel.  You would need medium term averaging to get any accuracy
    out of it, which is basically what the network time daemon stuff does
    for time synchronization over a network.

    If you need very high accuracy you will have to make a project out of 
    it... use a microcontroller to handle the time synchronization and
    make the whole thing a card you can pop into a slot or something like
    that.

This was true uptill a month or so again, it now handles all files

Subject: Trantor T130B SCSI Driver
From: kah@hollen.atl.ga.us (Keith A. Hollen)
Date: Sun, 14 Nov 1993 15:48:45 GMT

Is anyone working on a driver for the Trantor T130B SCSI card?
I'm using it for my NEC CDR-84 and Linux doesn't recognize it.
I'd like to get it working since I paid $89 for it and don't 
want to have to buy another SCSI card at this time. The card
works with MS-DOS and OS2 2.x.

By the way, I'm running a 0.99.12 kernel.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Well, it's not that bad in Linux using standard interrupts: 
on my 486/dx2-66 I played a bit with the timer interrupt for the scheduler 
which runns at 100 Hz. The interrupt is  generated from a 8254 timer 
which runns at 1.19MHz. so reading the timer i get usec accurancy
which is quite nice for doing such timing analysis.

When I read the timer latch in the interrupt (to see how long it was running
after the interrupt was signaled when counting throug zero) and plot 
a histogram from the interrupt latency (using gnuplot and with log y), 
very very few interrupt don't lie in the 11-12 usec interval
from a sample over several hours when I did kernel compilation 
and heady disk i/o and swaping for quite some time.

Of course Linux is no real time os at all (not yet?!) but for what i'm
doing 99.9% would be enough (and that seems to be possible with Linux).

but i've to admit that from time to time (about one time every few days), 
Linux still looses clock interrupts (always 2 interrupts at once, 
so the is at least one place in kernel where interrupts were locked 
for more than 10 ms).

at the moment, it's only my private interest to see, what's possible
with Linux and Intel and to play with clock synchronisation stuff in this
deep, but I know applications which tend to have the same requirements.

I have made wbuild 2.0 run on Linux. There were some memory allocation
bugs related to the use of keyboard accelerators, but I think I fixed them.
I also mailed the author about the bugs, and he promised the would be
fixed in the next release.

I can bunch my patched version together and mail it if you want, just
have to go home and get it, I don't have my linux box online.

Why not handle it the way isofs does (I believe it makes the resource
fork appear as a file of the same name, but with '=' prepended). It
would be nice to have some consistency in these things.

Moving the mouse pointer is one thing.  Moving windows is quite another.  I
would suspect that the Mac can handle it more easily because its window scheme
uses a 1-bit display as the lowest common demoninator, whereas X allows
windows to be created in visuals which in effect define the lowest common
denominator for the window in question --- so a window in an 8-plane visual
can't easily be moved to a 1-plane screen.

this argument is really quite mute.  I simply said in the beginning that

 Last Friday, I uploaded a library patch to sunsite.unc.edu which allows
programs to uncompress datafiles on the fly. (Thus allowing you to store
these datafiles compressed.)
 It is on sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/zlibc.src.tar.gz . 

 There is also a binary distribution in 
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/zlibc.so.4.4.4.tar.gz

 The documentation is only included in the source distribution, not in the

 Hope this helps,
