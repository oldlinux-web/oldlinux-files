As long as people have physical access to your machine (especially the
floppy drive), you're going to have a hard time stopping them from
booting Linux on a floppy, then mounting your hard disk, then doing
whatever they want.

Oh, ye of narrow mind.

Giving your users access to DOS is inherently a security hole.

And me..running X and getting into swap (I have 8M) is a sure way
to ensure a reboot. Large compiles (eg. an new kernel) also cause

Many people have reported this problem (SIG 11 during compiles) for
months.  Please try any of the following:

1) Disable your external cache in the BIOS setup.
2) Increase your RAM refresh rate in the BIOS setup (if possible).
3) Find a way to cool down your CPU operating environment.

I built static libraries for both of them the other day, and although
I had a few problems, I'm almost certain that they were caused
entirely by my own setup and won't trouble anybody else. While I'd be
happy to put a distribution together, I haven't the first idea how to
do it, so I'd advise that you compile them yourself. If I'm right
about the problems I had, then you should only have to do a
"configure" and a "make" for each package. And even if I'm wrong, and
you hit the same problems as me, my workarounds for them are listed
below, so that should get you by.

BTW - I'm posting the descriptions of these two problems for an
additional reason: I want to check that they're local to my setup.
That means, if you hear about/come across/experience a similar
problem, please let me know, and I'll assume it's a *real* bug and let
the relevant authorities know. I can't remember full error messages,
as I forgot them as soon as things started to work again, but they
shouldn't be hard to spot. All of these on a no-name 486sx25, 8Mb RAM,
10Mb swap, running pl12 kernel, GCC 2.4.5 and libc 4.4.1 (I know, I'm
out of date). :-)

First problem, GCC starts whingeing about undefined stuff in
"features.h," (in /usr/include (?)). This turned out to be a literal
backspace character (ie, a real ^H) in the file instead of an open
parenthesis. Easy fixed.

The other took a little black magic. The make suddenly stopped, with a
mysterious error that threatened possibly to be a compiler bug. I
tried it again a few times, with no success, then tried running the
last line again manually (ie, retyping all the flags, verbatim) except
using the command name gcc instead of cc. It still barfed, but the
next time I tried make again, everything went smoothly. I don't claim
to understand what happened here; if hocus pocus works, I'll use hocus
pocus. 

If you have similar problems, do shout.

Because it would take a good programmer 6-9months solid work, its a minor
problem in most people's eyes and there are important things to do. If
someone feels it is important enough they can go and write it (and for
once nobody will yell copyright and sue them). I doubt anyone will.

They don't. In this case microsoft have made it so hard to do this relatively

Reply-To: sohail@rhonda.jsc.nasa.gov

I am thinking of buying a EXB-4200 (or EXB-4200C) for my LINUX box.
So I decided to ask a few questions of I may.

a) How do you feel about the EXB-4200 (or EXB-4200C) support ?
b) I have a UltraStor 34F SCSI controller that I will daisy-chain from
   are there any known problems in this configurations.
c) Is there support for EXB-4200C ?
d) Is there support for EXB-8200 ?
e) why would one buy 8200 (usually more expensive) compare to 4200 ?
f) Is there support for any other DAT tape drives ?
g) Is the driver for EXB-4200 fairly mature ?

Since the drive cost about $800 - $900 I want to make sure that I could
use it effectively. Thanks in advance.

My Configuration [486/66 99p13 GCC2.4.5 4.4.4 VLB UltraStor34F]

Sincerely.

The security hole is letting someone run DOS on your machine.  A person
with a disk sector editor and a listing of the file system data structures
for whatever filesystem you use with Linux would have no trouble reading
your files.  No driver would be required.

Hi, I just installed linux SLS in my PC clone (486DX, 8 MB RAM

the modem access to my University is having problems. 
I have an internal bayes compatible 2400 bps modem. I am using
kermit. After the kermit prompt I dial a phone number. The modem
starts sending its request of connection, as it does with the
DOS program (procomm). But after the I get the connection, the message
"call complete" appears, and then the prompt from the kermit is
there waiting for the next command. I have read the FAQs, but no
one is related with this. 

Any help will be appreciated.

If you know that there might exist a core.[cho] in the directory, and your
binary is more than one character in length, then why not do something like

        rm -f core.??*

or something like that?  I have used this method many times to remove files
greater than one character in length, and leaving all those files with exactly
one character...

Booting DOS implies being able to shutdown the machine and telling LILO
to boot DOS and/or to boot from a floppy.

Booting Linux single-user implies exactly the same.

Either way, the guy/gal sitting in front of the box has access to
all your data, so having or not having a DOS driver to access a Linux
file system doesn't make any difference.

If you want DOS users to not be able to access your Linux data, that's
easy: disable booting from floppy, password-protect LILO, and let
them use dosemu.

NB: I do know that some programs don't work under the emulator. Yet.

That being said, personally I try not to even think about the existence
of MeSsy-DOS. The fact that I once wrote a comm program for the thing
is shameful enough. ;-)

Useless factoid: DOS once allowed you to create file names with spaces in 
them (maybe it still does, I wouldn't know), like "TEXT 1.TXT". No problem, 
just use a program that doesn't check for such inanities.
Of course, no DOS tool is able to delete this file... and no, "DEL *.TXT"
or DEBUG don't count.

Considering that Linux won't be running at the time, I think that's going
to be some magic trick.

However since you'll have access to the password (and shadow I guess) files
you can force the person to give a login and password before allowing file 
transfer.

Since I only have Linux on my machine, none of this affects me personally.

You don't need anything so complicated as a filesystem driver.  All
you need is the reverse of mtools.  You need a program that can read
the minix FS, and read/write files on it.  For example, from dos,
you'd be able to copy lcopy hda4:/tmp/myunixfile mydosfil.e.  Probably
most of the code is already in the kernel.  You'd just have to write
the front end.
