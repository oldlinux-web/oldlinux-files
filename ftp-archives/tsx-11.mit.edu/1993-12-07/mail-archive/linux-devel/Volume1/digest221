Maybe, this is a question, which should be posted to
comp.os.linux.help.

strlen(NULL) is illegal syntax, because NULL is not a pointer to
a string.  Rather, it points to the beginning of the text segment.
At this address is typically a long call instruction to the routine,
which loads the shared libraries.

A long call implies a one byte operand code and 4 byte address.
Unless the destination of the call exceeds 64 k, the two higher
bytes of the address are zero.  Thus, there are typically three
non-zero bytes at address zero.

Yes,

A pointer with the value 0 points to nothing usefull, this doesn't mean
you can't use this unusefull stuff, you just shouldn't.

Some architecture put a 0 on location 0, some give a SEGMENTATION 
VIOLATION, others just don't do special things and give you the
data that is availeble on 0.

Nothing strange about it.

A Terminal server would be the correct approach in a situation like that

However; wouldn't the pre-requisite in the use of a Terminal server be

Specialix market a terminal server with the following LIST prices (US $)


         8 ports        $1695
        16 ports        Add $650
        24 ports        Add Another $650
        32 ports        Add Another $650

The MTS is easily upgrable to 32 ports by attaching 8 port modules. The
modules are available as DCE, DTE, or RJ45 RS232 units, or as 7 RS232 +
one parallel.

Fragments are not necessarily a good idea.  There are two independent
values here:

  1)  How big should the block size be when allocating space for a
      file?

      On average, you will waste about half of the last block
      allocated, unless you make the block size _way_ too big and most
      files fit in less than one block, in which case you will waste
      more than half.

      On a typical Unix system, approx 40% of the files will be 1k or
      less, and 90% of the files will be 4k or less.

      If you make the block size too small, then too much space will
      be wasted keeping track of the blocks.

      So, the allocation unit should probably be somewhere around 1k,
      maybe as small as 256, maybe as large as 4k.


  2)  How much data should you read off the disk at one time?

      If you read too little data, then you are going to spend a lot
      of time dealing with the overhead of reading blocks.  You also
      won't be able to read consecutive tracks, causing rotational
      delays to be added in.

      If you read too much data, then you may well be wasting space on
      I/O buffers that could better be used for programs or data.

      Typically, 8k-128k should be read at one time, if you detect
      that the file is being read sequentially.  If it is being read
      randomly, then read the smallest amount possible.



The old Version 7 file system used 512 byte blocks, which is great for
an allocation size, but horrible for a disk access size.

The Berkeley Fast Filesystem changed things to use a 8k block size,
which is better for a disk access size, but horrible for an allocation
size.  In order to "fix" the problem with the allocation size, they
created fragments, which are 1k.  Unfortunately, you can only use a
fragment if the entire file fits in the fragment, so the FFS wastes,
on average 4k any time the file is over 1k in size.  Fragments add
additional code and complications when something needs to be moved too
or from a fragment.  The 8k block size also isn't large enough to get
really good throughput from the disk when reading sequentially, and it
is too large when reading randomly.


So, what is the solution?

Well, allocate things using a 512-2k blocksize, and read/write _many_
blocks at one time.  This is known as clustering.  It works better
than the FFS and the code is simpler to boot.


The Berkeley FFS also suffers from several other problems on modern
disk drives.  In particular, they made the assumptions that the users
knew how many heads, tracks and cylinders the disk had, and the the
number of tracks per sector stayed constant across the disk.  With
SCSI drives, you don't know this information and the tracks per sector
isn't constant.  IDE drives usually lie about the number of heads and
cylinders in order to work under DOS.


While the Berkeley FFS was much better than the Version 7 file system,
it is far from being an ideal filesystem.

I had the exact same problem. Here's how I fixed it:

1) keep your linux pl13 tar file in a safe place on your directory tree.

1 1/2) rename zImage to zImage.99.12 (safety reasons)

2)cd /usr/src/linux

3) rm -r -f *

4) tar xvf <tarfilename>

5) Follow the readme, make config, make dep, and finally make zBoot
   (or zImage, I forgot. Ony one is available, anyway).

6) Sit back and watch some tv for a while.. It took 20 minutes on my
   486DX33 to compile and build...

6 1/2) You may have to move the new zImage to the root dir...

7) Rerun /etc/lilo/install -v -v -v again (if you use lilo).

8) Enjoy.

Yup.  I've noticed this same problem as well.  I don't know what the root
cause of it is, but I have a workaround.  Here's the source to an abort() that
will cause the stack frame to be generated (preserved?) properly.  It won't
work when you're out of processes, but it'll work in all other cases:

    void abort()
    {
    int ppid;

        ppid = getpid();
        signal ( SIGABRT, SIG_DFL );
        if ( ! fork() )
        {
            kill ( ppid, SIGABRT );

I thought any file could use fragments at the very end of the file.
That is, the cluster size (transfer size) was 4k (8k on Sun), but the
allocation size was effectively 1k.  Files were laid out in contiguous
multiples of 4k, with the last few k scattered around in fragments.
If the file grew, the fragments were collected and copied into a new
block.

Other neat features of the BSD FFS were elevator head scheduling,
contiguous space allocation, and an attempt at reasonable free space
management -- directories and files created where there is room to
grow (to still provide contiguous allocation even in an in-use file
system, avoiding disk fragmentation).

Some of the journaling filesystems may achieve as good or better
performance, though, using a completely different approach.

Newer IDE drives, like SCSI drives, all seem to have "zones" with
different number of sectors per track in each zone -- so they have to lie.

It should segfault. That would make trapping NULL pointers easier. It already

I think this has changed, but I have no numbers to back it up.

In a non-fragmented FS, too much space will be wasted when it your
program does not fit into a  complete block.  Keeping track of the block
is pretty much the same cost no matter how big the file is since the
inode is of fixed length.

Right.  When you read in block-at-a-time mode, you can only read the blocksize
value at a time.  The larger the blocksize, the more data you read at one time.

Huh?  I think the end result is that if you read one block at a time, you read
one block at a time.  This has very little bearing on disk tracks.

???  This is irrelavant to the file-system, and is a problem with your buffer
code being overly agressive.

What *ARE* you talking about?  The fragments are used for the tail ends
of the files.  Say you have a 40.1K file, with an 8K/1K filesystem.  
With a non-fragmented file-system, you would use up 6*8K=48K of your
file system space, because the first 40K of the file fills up 5 8K
blocks, but you MUST use an entire block in order to store the final
data.  So, out of a 40.1 K file we have 7.9K of wasted space.

However, with the Berkeley FFS (and other similar FS), we use the same
original 5 8K blocks as well, but because we have 1K fragments, we break
up the blocks into 8-1K chunks.  The final .1K of the file fits into the
1K chunk.  This is only wasting 0.9 K of space, instead of the 7.9K.  A
fragmented file-system will almost invariably use less space than a
non-fragmented file-system.

However, as you eluded to above, the tradeoff is speed.

??? 8K isn't large enough to get really good throughput.  Let's see some
numbers to back that up.  I get VERY good performance using an 8K/2K
BSD-FFS with the 486/33.  (1.5MB/sec reading and 1MB/sec writing w/out
any hardware cache on a 486/33 ISA box.  On EISA boxes I've seen numbers
in the upper 2's and 3's)

Hmm, I know how many heads, tracks, cylinders and such on my drive. 
And, the filesystem knows how to optomize for this.  If you don't know
this information, it can't optomize for it but the BSD-FFS doesn't
REQUIRE this information for it to work effeciently.

(And it was pointed out in a followup article that most newer drives use
zones.  I've heard that the BSD 4.4 SCSI drivers take this information
into account so that the FS can use them.)

Nobody is claiming it's the ideal filesystem, but it sure beats alot of
existing filesystems that are currently out there.

The BSD-FFS with the recent 4.4 additions to it is still one of the
fastest filesystems around.   (Now if we could pry those changes out of
the author, but he has been too busy with real work to get them to us.
:-)  Let's all hope that the USL-BSDI suit ends soon.

Most of the 'lying' is required because of MS-DOS's 1024 cylinder limit.

Subject: Motif - Pay? BAH!
Date: 12 Nov 1993 00:50:48 -0500

Hi all...

Well, today I wanted to get Mosaic-2.0 and compile it on my machine...

I can't.

I don't have Motif. I refuse to purchase a binary-only distribution,
and a source distribution is too pricey.  Therefore, I'd like to throw
out a project idea if the legalities allow for such...

I'd like to begin programming a Motif clone that we can pass around
under GPL to whomever would like it, assuming that we can legally
get around the naming conventions, etc. (by this I mean, can we call
the cloned functions the same names as the Motif ones, etc... ?)

Ideally it would be a drop-in replacement for Motif, allowing the end
user to simply create a soft-link to the "clone" library with a name 
libXm.a and they would (in a nutshell) have a transparent replacement.
(you should have a grasp of the idea by now ;)

I've begun this discussion in comp.os.linux.development simply because
it's a good place to start.  I know there are sufficiently many lovers
of "free" software herein, and maybe a few have enough time to devote...
If we (as a general community) feel it to be a good idea, then I shall
enlist help from without.

This seems to be one of the last pieces of software that aren't
available for "free" that the masses use on a daily basis
(for X in a unix environment, anyway :).

This seems like a TREMENDOUS task to undertake, but heck, writing linux
was a tremendous task in itself...  Nothing is impossible, and I need some
focus to my energies anyway ;)

I'd like to be the organizer / chief coder so as to make this my
resume-topper :)  I've got time to devote to this task, and I feel it would
be a very well received piece of software (once again, assuming legalities
are surmountable).

I've received so many benefits from "free" software, now I'd like to make my
contribution...

interested?

'nuff said...

I shall be looking into the formal specifications in the near future, and
with all the responses I've already gotten (via email), I'm tentatively
planning the design stages to begin in the next week to two weeks...

Everyone who's mailed me will go into a pseudo mailing list...

Keep messages coming...
