For the benefit of others, here's what you can do:  Just change
startup_time to (xtime.tv_sec-jiffies/HZ)  Then the kernel accounting

     I don't see why any higher resolution would be needed.  As the
speed of the link goes up, start bit detection probing timeing also
increases.  Taking 16 samples per bit time would get you close enough
to the real start time of the bit it shouldn't matter.  The only hassel
comes when trying to auto detect speed, but that is usuall done via
softwear and using break signals to denote mis matched speeds. Having
more samples complicates the hardware and dosen't increase accuracy
significantly, it just raises costs and complexity.  Oh, be thankfull
they use 16, older UARTS often used 4 or 8 or were edge triggered
which is a 1 x sampling frequency.

If it is just an xterm session, then yes, you could do this by using
"screen".  Screen would let you have up to ten sessions within one
xterm, and you can move those sessions to another terminal without
interuption.

The solution I presented is not X specific, but I don't know of a way
to do this with X programs.

Date: 14 Nov 1993 06:44:25 GMT

 From: peter j dohm (dohm@cis.ohio-state.edu):
  Well i've been informed by a few people (and now that they mentioned it,
  I do remember seeing this in one of the CLARINET newsgroups.. my memory is
  going... :) that Motif has been adopted as the user-interface of
  choice in the COSE collaboration.  If this is indeed the case, OSF
  *supposedly* will release Motif into the public domain for our consumption.

Not quite, no.  COSE will indeed be an ``open standard'' in that
anyone can get the specification and do their own implementation.
This does *not* mean that OSF's implementation will be free or in the
public domain - they'll most likely continue to charge for Motif the
way they do now - they'll just sell to more people (or, more likely,
more vendors).  Remember, if `Free Software' doesn't necessarily mean
`Software for no price', then `Open Software' *certain;y* doesn't...

It's worth mentioning here that I've heard rumours of at least two
non-OSF Motif implementations - NCD's is supposedly especailly nice,
but I've never seen any of them.  I take this (if true - no idea,
myself) to mean that anyone can do their own implementation if they
like.

That said, I'd be interested in working on such a free widget set
sometime; right *now* I don't have the time (or the expertise, really)
to do much, but that may change in the reasonably near future,
especially given an interesting project to work on. :-) For work in
this area, you could take a look a the 3D extensions to the Athena
Widgets (Xaw3D) and whatever is currently coming out of the Free
Widget Foundation (no joke!  There really is such a group (albiet
small))

Good luck.

Expensive compared to what?  50 reasonable modems are going to cost him
several thousand dollars, and 50 phone lines are going to be several
thousand dollars per year (assuming rates in his country are comparable
to U.S. rates).

Is an external controller expensive compared to the rest of his project?

In fact, it seems strange for him to be concerned about the cost of the
operating system.  Even if he buys some commercial Unix for a thousand
bucks, it sounds like that is going to be just a small part of his
costs.

Part of the FWF widgets are written in a web-like language which
looks promising. The precompiler (wbuild) dumps core on my machine
yet. If someone has already ported it successfully using it
would surely boost up development speed.

yes, but arent all Motif apps dynamically linked in some way ? thus meaning
that if you try to run stuff, you still need the libraries on the machine, as
they are loaded at run-time ?

well, why don't you just give xterm a display string when you load it up?

  ie "xterm -display the.other.machine:0"

[ I didn't get any response, so I try this group. It has
  something to do with kernel development... ]

  Hello Linuxers,

  I have a question for those that already have dug deep down
  in the Linux kernel and library sources. I am in the process
  of evaluating a persistent storage system for my linux box.
  The system is called Texas and is currently at version 0.2.
  I'll give a small excerpt from the catalog of free databases
  at the end of this mail, describing what Texas is...

  Now, to be able to implement this library, they make use of:

    1) currently, the mprotect system library call.
       (available on SunOS, Ultrix ... not in linux)
    2) in future versions, the mmap library call.
       (implemented in linux)

  These are my thoughts and question:

  a) mprotect being not implemented is OK for me, since they 
     will use mmap in the future.

  b) is mmap as implemented in Linux OK for this application ?
     To illustrate this I'll include an excerpt of my communication
     with the friendly people from Texas University (Thanks Sheetal). 

   ----- I wrote Sheetal -----------------------------------------
   |"No mprotect is not implemented in the kernel, [...]
   |On the other hand, what interests me more is

   "Texas is a simple, portable, high-performance persistent store
