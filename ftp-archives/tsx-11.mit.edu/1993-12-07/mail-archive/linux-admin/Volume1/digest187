   I just want underpin this request. I asked the very question a couple of times 
   but noone could give a resonable answer about this topic. Instead I recently
   got a getty-implementation in my hands, where was said:

       "... on LINUX use the ttyS-devices not the cua-devices. No, I'm not
         willing to disuss this here ..."

   Just great! The whole thing did not work with ttyS-devices at all -- but is
   working just fine with a cua-device now ... bewildering!

      "Undocumented software is shitware!"

   The point is that the manual section 4 (devices) is nearly empty. It seems
   that people who write device drivers think, that they did a great job, when
   their driver is doing fine just FOR THEM and some others who could follow the
   development -- others are kept standing in the rain!

   Listen all you guys out there, who provide us with software of any kind for 
   LINUX: We (the community) can't read your brains. So you got to write it
   down, what you indented with your code, its implemetation and the way it is 
   to be integrated.

   If there is anything wrong with LINUX, it is its documentation.
      - where are the man-pages fd(4), hd(4), sd(4), rmt(4) etc.?
      - where is explained that LINUX does not know 'raw'-disks and why?
        (a.s.o, a.s.o)

   Not a single piece of everything that can be found in /dev is documented in
   any way. In this respect LINUX can drive you mad sometimes. No I'm not asking 
   to make LINUX foolproof.

        "One can't make things foolproof, since fools are so genious" (Murphy)

    I'm just asking for keeping me from asking stupid questions.

Of course, we run Linux here - all the machines here <counting on fingers>,

is used quite heavily for development, and has a full newsfeed coming into
it.  Of course, it's connected to the Internet via a T1 line.  I will be adding
a 6th machine over the weekend, I'm sure... :)

Hi !

I've run in to a slight problem. I made a lot of changes
and now I don't know if to blame Linux or not.

I'm currently running 0.99pl13r and the problem occurs
when I try to NFS mount a disk from our HP-server.

The message I get is :
mount clntudp_create: RPC: Program not registered
mount clntudp_create: RPC: Program not registered
mount clntudp_create: RPC: Program not registered

We used to run HP-UX 8.07 on a HP720. Today we uppgraded
to a HP735 with HP-UX 9.01 and I uppgraded my kernel and 
filesystems from the latest SLS to the newer versions of
Linux and e2fs (and the /etc/binaries).

So should I blame Linux or HP ? Of course I suspect HP ;-)

Please answer somebody.

Date: Thu, 25 Nov 1993 14:10:05 GMT

I am getting a lot out of Linux at work.  Our inventory follows...

        - three 486/33 machines setup for general purpose Unix 
          development and as X workstations.

        - two 386/16 machines working as network printer servers.

        - five tiny AMPRO [34]86 CPUs running as the distributed 
          'brain' of a new robot we are building in-house.

        - one 386/16 running control software for a pair of MICROBOT 
          TeachMover arms and a VOTRAX speech synthesizer.

In the next few days (?) I am planning on adding a 386 running Linux to
a Cybermotion robot base that currently has no on-board control CPU.

One of our robot vendors supportes Linux as the native operating system
on a base that they sell.  (We are currently running OS/2 on ours)

We make extensive use of software gathered from the Net.  We also have
ported network-based robotics communications software called TelRIP
that was developed at Rice University.

My opinion is that Linux is a stable system that provides a
U*ix-compatible, flexible alternative to commercial software running on
a variety of cheap hardware.

Rumor has it that this error is usually caused by bad grounding.

Usually, disk and tape drives have these little metal tabs on the back where 
you should attach a separate ground wire. 

Another possible explanation is a flaky or overworked power supply, or
marginal SCSI or power supply cabling.

My $0.02: Gandalf uses a network of Linux boxes to test network products.  
Each Linux box is connected to two networks: the control network, and the 
network under test.  The boxes have a combination of packet generators, snmp 
slaves, net sniffers and the like - and a master control program running on a 
sparc server controls them all and analyses the results.  They used to use 
SCO Xenix, but found that Linux had better network support, and they could 
hack on it when it didn't work.
