Hi,

        I have seen the announcements for XFree 2.0. I have the Yggdrasil LGX
Fall 93 distribution installed. What I am confused about is that there are
so many files listed. Which ones do I really need? I only want binaries and
whatever libaries I need. I have simple VGA, no specialized video boards? What
is the minimal files that I need? Can I just install right on top of LGX?

Thanks for your help,
Sam

That's roughly the figures I come up with. An IPC is a little over 1000
per second, an IPX about 1250 per second, and my home IPX upgraded with
the Weitek Power uP is about 1550 per second.

This algorithm seems to be memory-bandwidth limited, so the weitek doesn't
manage to speed it up all that much. In any case, the specific output from
a Power uP:

./speedc
Running crypt(libc) for 100 seconds of virtual time ...
Did 39.590000 crypt()s per second.
./speedf
Running UFC-crypt for 100 seconds of virtual time ...
Did 1548.189941 fcrypt()s per second.

CSLIP isn't going to help much in tests of bandwidth.  CSLIP
effectively removes most of the IP and TCP header.  This doesn't make
so much difference with large packets, size the header is probably 5
to 10% of the packet.  Where it makes a big difference is interactive
response.  With telnet, you've typically got a packet with 40 bytes of
header and 1 byte of data.  Assume about 1 Kbyte/sec.  That means it's
going to take 80 millisec for an echo (the packet has to go both
ways).  That's a long enough delay to be annoying.  CSLIP almost
completely eliminates that.  So a telnet connection changes from
something painful to something almost as good as a hardwired line.  I
haven't noticed that modem compression makes much difference to the
interactive feel of a line, though it may have some effect on FTP
throughput.  I'd love to see the equivalent of CSLIP for X.
Unfortunately X has its own overhead, which CSLIP won't help with.

Why don't use tar floppies ?
You will be able to untar them on most Unix systems whith a 3"1/2 drive,
I do that all the time. (At least between Linux/Sun/Sony/RS600) 

You will loose disk space, however; because it is a bad idea to try to
make multivolume tar disks: Don't  expect the last tracks to be correctly

In fact that's required behavior under most Unices. The SunOs (4.1.1)
man page states:

SYNOPSIS
     mv [ - ] [ -fi ] filename1 filename2
     mv [ - ] [ -fi ] directory1 directory2
     mv [ - ] [ -fi ] filename ...  directory

DESCRIPTION

        [...]

     The second form of mv moves (changes the name of) directory1
     to  directory2,  only if directory2 does not already exist -
     if it does, the third form applies.

     The third form of mv moves one or more filenames  (may  also
     be  directories)  with  their  original names, into the last
     directory in the list.

(Reprinted without permission)

In other words, because the second directory already existed, you were
telling mv that you wanted the first directory to be moved into the
second directory. Which is precisely what it did. If you wanted the
contents of the first directory to be moved into the second one,
something like:
        mv dir1/* dir2

would have been more appropriate.

        Cheers,
        Bruce.

Another helpful thing is to add the line

to the uugetty.xxx file.  This will create a debugging transscript in

This seems like an obvious question, but I don't find a definitive
description in any of the docs.

What exactly is the difference between /dev/ttyS<n> and /dev/cua<n>?
I.e. device majors 4 and 5.

In the course of reading c.o.l.* over the weeks I've seen people
having problems with a tty advised to try using the cua instead, as well as
the converse, and "see if that fixes it".  :-)

Since I am frequently plugging one serial thing into another, I'd like
to operate from a position of knowledge rather than trial and error -
so can anyone provide a thorough and correct description of the
difference between these two devices?

To remove colors from ls:

   * Remove the -o option from your .profile, /etc/profile, .cshrc or
     /etc/csh.cshrc file.

To change colors:

   * Define an LS_COLORS variable.


It is all in the manpage, by the way.  Also, as a fair warning, the
next version of color-ls (currently in alpha testing) will have a new
format LS_COLORS variable, in order to be more terminal independent.

By the way, color-ls does not use (n)curses.

Yes.
I compiled it with only two changes. In tclMain.c i inserted
#include <unistd.h> (for the definition of R_OK). The same in tkMain.c. 

Annyone here made dll-Libraries for tcl7.1 and tk3.4 ????

I think you are refering to color ls?

If so try

alias 'ls=--no-colors'

or recompile ls.

Although I did use code from one of Peter's earlier patches (and probably
wouldn't have gotten far without it :^), the color ls in the current
Slackware does not use the LS_COLORS environment variable. All the color
defaults in it are hard coded.

Jayme Cox sent me an updated version of my first color-ls patch, and I've
used it to crank out yet-another-color-ls-patch that I plan to include in
Slackware very soon. It reads its defaults from a file (/etc/DIR_COLORS)
that's completely reconfigurable, including which file extensions are
recognized. This new patch (against GNU fileutils 3.9) is on ftp.cdrom.com
in /pub/linux/misc.

And for all you color-haters, you erase /etc/DIR_COLORS - no color.

In response to the original question, you can get rid of colors in
Slackware 1.1.0 any of the following methods:
 1. Copying the ls from /bin to /usr/bin.
 2. Removing the ls in /usr/bin.
 3. Putting /bin ahead of /usr/bin in your path.

All of these methods are mentioned in the SLACKWARE_MINI_FAQ you find at
most Slackware sites, BTW.

The ttyS devices - when not opened O_NONBLOCKing - block your open(2)
syscall until at least the carrier detect signal is high. If the
corresponding cua device is busy, open(2) blocks, too.

The cua devices dont't care about carriers and open(2) non blocking.
If the corresponding ttyS device is in use, opening a cua device will
return EBUSY immediately.

For further information i advise you to view
/usr/src/linux/kernel/chr_drv/serial.c. Search for rs_open() and friends.
block_til_ready() is the one that makes the difference.

Yes, Pauline Middelink (middelin@calvin.iaf.nl) has. You can get the

You don't need to apply the kernel patches if you're running Linux

I can't turn off xflow somehow.  For instance, while in Emacs or

Emacs have the character.  So saving is impossible except via
^X^C or ^X^W, etc..  searches always have to be done backward, etc.
sz/rz won't work, either.

I HAVE looked at stty OVER and OVER and OVER... I have looked into
tset, gettytabs, and even setterm.  This is a pain.  I have tried to
mimick other machines' stty configurations which don't have the same
problem when I log in with exactly the same modem software via the
same terminal server.  But nothing seems to help.

Does anyone know what to set?  Is it the driver?  What?

Thanks for *any* help, sorry if I haven't been specific enough, I can
