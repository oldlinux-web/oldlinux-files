No, he's perfectly correct.  When you invoke a shell script, the shell
gets invoked with name of the shell script in argv[0].  So if the name
of the shell script is '-', then that's what the shell will see.  Most
Bourne shells will interpret the '-' as meaning "I'm an interactive
login shell".  So it doesn't matter at all what's in the setuid shell
script; if you symlink it to the name '-', when you execute it, you will
get a setuid shell.

This is not a kernel programming issue --- even if you have a kernel
which support setuid shell scripts by handing the shell interpreter the
script in a file descriptor (which is the only way to avoid the race
condition security hole) --- if you have a shell which automatically
becomes an interactive shell when argv[0] contains a leading '-', all is
lost.

The bottom line is that setuid shell scripts are tricky.  Even if you
have a "secure system that supports setuid scripts", if the system
administrator then installed the Bourne shell, and writes setuid scripts
referencing it, you will still lose.

True, writing any type of setuid program is tricky; but adding in an
additional level of interpretation on top of things compounds the
possibilities for security holes.

   No, I have an even better one. Whenever crond tries to send mail to some
   user, it fails miserably and sends it to some adress mail remembers from
   earlier sent mails. Of course, I have removed the original "mail" and
   replaced it with a link to elm. Linking it to smail doesn't help at all.

    There are a number of bugs in currently packaged releases that make slip 
    gateways problematic.  They HAVE been fixed in the latest net 2-Beta, 
    but I would strongly recommend that non network hackers not fool with 
    this release for at least another week or two while the bugs get ironed
    out.

    That warning aside, I would like to say that I myself am running a SLIP
    gateway to the internet along side an ethernet based localnet and it works,
    and that I will be posting a SLIP scripting package real soon now (it may
    have to wait until after my grandfather's 80th over the weekend, though).

    So waiting will probably save you time!

The mount fails with

I can mount the Linux filesystem from a NeXT, I can also mount the ISC

In /etc/exports I only have:

Any ideas?

This is caused by "root" being a member of too many groups ( >= 8).
Try editing /etc/groups and remove root from some of the groups.

Replacing the base series probably will not work, but other stuff can be
replaced if you remove it first with pkgtool.

I think the next big upgrade (probably when XFree86 2.0 comes out) will
move the symbolic links out of the packages themselves and into the 
installation scripts that are included with each package. That's if I
can toss together something that does this automatically - I sure ain't
gonna do it by hand. :^)

It should then be possible to upgrade evry part of an existing system,
including the whole base system, libraries, kernel, etc. 1.0.4 is not a
real massive overhaul. The biggest improvements come in the X series.
You might want to remove just your X stuff, and then use the new
bootdisk to add the X windows series to your system.

I've pointed this out before, but for anyone having this problem:

Vixie Cron, when compiled with the default configurations, uses a funny
flag to mail that makes some mailers choke. I took this out and
recompiled it. The fixed crond is in /pub/linux/binaries on ftp.cdrom.com. 

This problem was, of course, fixed in Slackware 1.0.4.

If you included a 

clock -s

or 

clock -s -u

(if your hardware clock is set in GMT - recommended, as this manages
daylight saving time automatically) in your /etc/rc and made a proper
link from your local timezone to localtime in /usr/lib/zoneinfo, you
should be well set. See /usr/lib/zoneinfo/time.doc for further
details.

Another place to look into is /etc/defaults/login. Maybe there
is a TZ variable defined. Remove this definition, Linux doesn't
need the TZ variable.
