I can also recommend this disk. It's by far the best Linux CD-ROM
I've seen, with a couple of different installation options. There's
even a "live" system on the disk that I can symbolic link to.

They also put BSD-386 and lots of assorted utilities on
the disk.

I got it two days after I placed my order. (Some other company kept
me waiting a l-o-n-g time for their disk!)

slap is the next version of term1.0.7.  it will support: multiple modems
in parallel, reconnection after carrier loss, better rc handling, tredir
integrated into slapd, secure multi-user mode, udp redirection, and more.  it
is not released yet.  development is not currently open to the public --
there is just simply too much going on to try to support/coordinate this
project outside the development team.

There are only few of the "fancier" Boot Managers which allow booting from
Active Partitions on a Second Hard Drive (I do not believe Linux's fdisk
has the potential).  What I have successfully done on my system (with its two
SCSI Hard Drives), is install Linux (Slackware 1.0.3) on the second drive
(leaving the DOS and Interactive Partitions on the first drive untouched)!
I am restricted to booting from the LILO Boot disk which Slackware's 
Setup Program generated for me.  Sounds like your's are IDE Drives, I do not
know if the same will work (but we are planning to attempt the same thing
on an IDE based based machine next week).

If you try the LILO Boot Disk "trick" can you let me know your results.  We are
planning to do the same with a 210 Meg WD and a 200 Meg Maxtor (both IDE, the
Maxtor will be the slave, DOS is already on the WD)?

I sure wish this would happen--I've got a Pro*C application that I'd
really, REALLY like to run direct on my Linux box, but I can't port it
there because I don't have the Oracle libraries it needs.  That means
the only way I can use this application from home, is to run it
someplace else and use my Linux machine as a remote X terminal...which
is unappealingly slow, even with a 14.4 Kbps SLIP to run across.  Bummer.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in

I tried mailing you in response, but the mail bounced claiming that
"graphix" was an unknown user.

I just wanted to say that I've been having the exact same problem that
you have.  I added a swap file, and that helped for a while, but I'm
back to having X hang on me now.  (8Mb swap did nothing, 16Mb was the

Ok so everyone knows I messed up slightly on the instructions. Keep the old
CONFIG and Makefile. Net2Debugged is really a short term thing. All the
magic goodies from it should percolate into the real NET-2E as it comes along
(I've been emailing things to FvK as I go). Net2Debugged still isn't a 100% 
reliable trip to paradise however. I've got two fixes I've found since the 
release.

>After compiled and booting, the new net2 stuff won't even detect my ethercard.
Sounds like a configuration error. The new net2 doesn't alter the ethernet
detection at all. Please email me if you have any problems. If it is a bug in
net-2debugged I want to track it down, if not then I don't mind helping anyway.

They are on athos.rutgers.edu in /pub/linux. The've improved things here 
but not 100%. I know Fred van Kempen has improved the NET-2 code in NET-2E
to remove some complicated problems with ACK packets not being sent in
certain cases (causing odd lockups of links) so I deduce these are still
in NET-2D

Tried exactly the same.  I've got no network at home, but we're trying to
get the network stuff going at the University.  Even using the loopback
net, just `rlogin myself' followed by logout crashed the system without
any message!?  At least that works on plain pl13.  Now I trust that the
inet-D package is debugged, but how does one get it *properly* linked
to the kernel?

The first thing I want are *reliable* remote running X11 applications.
The second thing I want is nfs.  NIS would be the greatest!

This file is uudecoded! Simply copy it in an file

The result is a file with the name diamond-fix.tar.Z

ObjectBuilder works with XFree 1.2 and 1.3.  I rather suspect that Joe

Subject: ObjectBuilder and OI for Linux released
Date: Thu, 23 Sep 1993 00:36:25 GMT


I posted the following to comp.os.linux.announce, but thought I'd also
post a copy here.  Email me if there are any problems with the
distribution.

Warner

ParcPlace is making freely available its popular ObjectBuilder(tm) and
Object Interface (OI(tm)) products for the Linux operating system.
ObjectBuilder is a GUI builder written completely in C++, that enables
UNIX C++ developers to apply the principles of object-orientation to
the development of user interfaces. OI, a C++ class library, provides
the toolkit foundation for ObjectBuilder. OI implements the
look-and-feel of both Motif 1.2 and OPEN LOOK. OI is built directly on
top of Xlib and is unencumbered by runtime royalties to any party.
ObjectBuilder and OI are very extensible, actively facilitating the
use of subclassing to create new, reusable, user interface components.


The software in this release is fully functional.  You can do exactly
the same things with this release that you can in our fully supported
commercial versions.  We do not have the resources to devote to
supporting and testing the port of ObjectBuilder and OI to Linux, so
we are releasing it to the Linux community in the hopes that it will
prove useful to that community. Obviously, if you like the Linux
version you will also like our commercial products that exist on Sun,
HP, DEC, and IBM workstations...

The COPYING policies are appended to this announcement.

The release is available from tsx-11.mit.edu in
/pub/linux/packages/OI.  The files under that directory are:
        COPYING         States the terms and conditions of copying
                        this release.
        oi1, oi2, oi3   subdirectories that correspond to three 3.5"
                        floppies that are in SLS format and can be
                        installed with sysinstall.
        oi40.tar        The above subdirectories as one file

This software is also available directly from ParcPlace for a nominal
fee that covers our manufacturing costs. In addition to 3 diskettes
containing the software, you will get a 250 page book for
ObjectBuilder and a 1200 page book for OI. Send email to
info@parcplace.com or call 1-800-759-7272 (USA and Canada) or
1-408-481-9090 (ask for international sales) for more information.

If you have any OI applications that you'd like to distribute, send me
email (imp@Boulder.ParcPlace.COM) and I'll be happy to add it to a
user contrib area on tsx-11.

Just to add something here.

My brother got me turned on to Linux when he brought out his then
brand new 386-40 machine running it.  About 9 months later when I had
the money for a good machine, I went out and purchased a machine.
Given that we could work from home on occasion, and that I had this
machine at home, it was only natural that I port the stuff I was
working on to Linux.  If I recall correctly, the port took something
like 8 hours, and most of that was waiting for OI/OB to compile.  The
rest of it was fighting g++ bugs, with a broken header file or two
tossed into just to make things interesting.

Once the port was done, I told the folks at the office about it.  They
weren't sure what, if anything, to do about it.  I thought about
putting a time bombed version out, but the head of technical support
suggested just to put it out there w/o any jimmied code.  The
marketing manager went for the idea.  We gave copies away at Xhibition
and it had a huge response.  My poor mailbox was melted down for weeks
with people asking for copies.  It was also able to postively
influance a few sales cycles, so it has been worth it to us.  It was
just uploaded to tsx-11 (and should appear at sunsite soon).

The hardest part was moving this project from a hack that I did so I
could get work done at home, to a product that we'd be giving away
and/or selling.
