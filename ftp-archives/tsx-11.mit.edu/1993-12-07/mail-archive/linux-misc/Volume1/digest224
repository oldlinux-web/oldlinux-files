This probably isn't fair to Peter, but it's certainly funny :-) I guess

I got it working after I noticed that two of the structures have elements
called *.index .  One of the #define's somewhere redefines this to something
else, which causes a core dump.

The offending structures are a color structure in Vlib.h (?) and the craft
structure in pm.h .

I just pumped the whole tree through a sed script ('s/\.index/\.mydex/g').

Then I started wasting lots of time.   =)

It might be the better idea to redirect the answers, either by not
answering at all to the wrong type of question or by posting the 
answer to c.o.l.h. You will never be able to prevent all misdirected
questions, but the chances might be a little bit better with directing
the answers. And if only the questions appear and not the followups and
flames (which in general should go via email, I do not like to wast my
time with skipping flames for misdirected questions) then the amount of 
inappropriate posts could be drastically reduced.
And it might even be that more people begin to think that c.o.l.h is
the right place to put their question.

No offense, nothing person, but I *hate* the color in color-ls.

Reply-To: cls@truffula.sj.ca.us


Last Friday, I warned (in comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware) against the
CMS Jumbo 250 for non-DOS (ie. Linux) applications.  I was, it
seems, out of date.
Let this article serve as a correction and an update.
Sorry if you see the quoted articles twice.

In article 2155@bridge2.NSD.3Com.COM, I wrote:

When I got home (where I do most of my Usenetting) I found
two articles about CMS and Linux in comp.os.linux.development.

In <CEuuvI.Bqt@cbnewsk.cb.att.com>, Steve Falco
(saf@whservh.att.com) reported trouble with his CMS Jumbo 250:

But Gareth Bult (gareth@gblinux.demon.co.uk) in <392@gblinux.demon.co.uk>
gave a promising status report on his success with the new Linux driver
for the thing:

I use vile which is mostly vi compatible (:map support is weak, but being 
worked on), but has the added advantage of providing multiple buffers 
(pulled from microemacs). You can get the source from ftp.cayman.com:/pub/vile/
or a binary from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/apps/editors/vile-3.61-bin.tar.gz

So, don't use it.  Even if you want the other features (8 bits,
unified) don't use the -o option.

There is some possibility were are getting more soon, too.  Some other

For god's sake, why?  dump/restore is the only widely-available
backup program that does true multi-level backups.  After a
catastrophic disk failure, I wouldn't want anything else to
restore from.

Sounds like a simple problem to me.  Doesn't the 6150 have a known
density and tape length?  If not if you know how much you can
fit on the tape, it's a simple matter to fudge the BPI and caclulate
the length based on the "assumed" BPI.  Don't throw away the
book just because it has an ugly cover.
