   Well, there *is* a simple solution.

   If anybody knows a node name for Byte, or how we can get mail there,
write them a note and complain about the false advertising.  I can assure
you that there are very few magazines that will tolerate this sort of
thing once they know about it - their reputations depend on it.

  Take the time to write a clear statement about *why* the ad is
misleading, and you can help save some poor sucker a few bucks, before
he shells out the money so that he can run WP/Win on his Unix system.


  I believe that BIX ( Byte Information Exchange ) is on the net - any
idea what the address is?

I wonder if calls to Unix Review (one place this @#$! runs) objecting to

Subject: PATCHES: Re: Need help: 'loadkeys' crashes my Linux SLS 1.03
Date: Tue, 28 Sep 1993 22:07:38 GMT

The SLS 1.03 loadkeys program doesn't match the kernel keyboard
driver.  Additionally, the keyboard driver allows non-existant shift
key functions tables to be called through.  Below are patches for both
problems.

-eric messick (eric@synopsys.com)


NR_SHIFT is 16, but the shift value is 1<<(whichshiftkey), so if
(whichshiftkey) was 5 (for example), shift_state would be set to 32,
but there are only 16 shift tables, so the lookup of the next key
would be through a non-existant table.  This is non a problem with the
default keymap, because it has no shift values greater than 3.  Nor is
it a problem with the patched loadkeys below, but it is a problem with
the original loadkeys, which generates shift keys greater than 3.

I'm less sure of the modifications below, because I don't know which
way the keyboard code is evolving (is it loadkeys that's out of date,
or the driver?  I'm betting loadkeys).  In addition to fixing the
incompatabilities mentioned above, I also make loadkeys create entries
for all of the multiple modifier keytables.  This lets me do
Ctrl-Shift-Underscore for undo in emacs, and Meta-Shift->, etc...
What I'm not sure about is what to do for Shift-AltGr combinations.
Currently, I ignore the Shift.  Anyone know if this is correct?

Subject: How to use gdb to get processo register values?
Date: 28 Sep 1993 22:09:31 GMT


I wish to debug a program using GDB 4.8 (on Linux SLS 1.03) that
is mostly in C, but parts are in i486 Assembly lang. I die in
these assembly routines. I can get the location of where I died,
and can look at instructions, but I can't find out the values
of processor registers. Thus if I see that I died in


        movl    (%edx), %eax

I can tell that I must have gotten a bogus value in edx, but I
don't know how to see it.

Can gdb show cpu registers? I have used other debuggers before
than do, such as MIPS RISC OS debugger for R[234]000 family processor.

Any help and hints welcome.

That shouldn't break anything.

I hate that. It's very easy to do the #ifdef trick, the error message shows 
me that the author of the offending software screwed up on their portability, 
and the program gets a bit shorter if what's unused is never compiled in.

On the other hand, if SIGBUS is ever changed to do something real, then all 
the programs which used the old definition should be recompiled if there's 
any chance they can get SIGBUS, which -- given that they probably also trap 
SIGSEGV and that libraries are mapped in via mmap() -- might not be 
impossible. Ugh.

So it seems that the SIGUNUSED alias in fact gives us the worst of both 
sides..

I am planing to have a 486 PC runing Linux as a file server.  Could someone 
tell me how much RAM it will need to do so?  Does it take a lot of CPU time
to do the NFS things?  If not, is it still able to run X-window?

Yes, but if Linux ever wants to break out of it's "plaything" image then it's
got to address the "DOS sell-out" crowd.  Linux's biggest drawback right now is
that it's mainly a product of the Net and not out in the "real world".

This is the perseption that it needs to break away from.

Subject: Want to Buy Linux on 3.5 disks (SLS version)?
Date: 29 Sep 93 02:01:54 GMT

Hi nettors,

I am interested in installing Linux on a 386/486 machine with 4-8 MB ram
and about 340 MB HD.  I used to follow this newsgroup and it has been
quite a while since I have read any items in these groups.

I understand that the SLS version is available on 3.5 disks.  If so
could one of you send me an email about procuring it.  I need all the
utils including X, gcc, all tools, sources etc etc. 

There was some DOCUMENTATION effort goiong on in Linux.  Has that group
produced the results of that effort i.e. The "LINUX BIBLE".

Answers to the abopve questions are appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

I too had a problem on two machines dying at the adlib sound card message.
One was an AST 486 with all of the standard I/O on the mother board plus a
novell ne2000 card. The other was a no-name black box 40 mhz 386 with an
adaptec scsi card and a _novell_ne200_card_. NONE of the adresses or irq's
appeared to conflict. I solved my problem by changeing the novell card to
use 300h and irq5, (supposedly a non-standard setting, but it works).
The troubleshooting was vexing..different kernels..6 mchines...differnent
versions...screw with the hardware jumpers...sleep at last!
