No problem. Just modify your Xconfig so that the horizontal sync pulse
comes later. Its probably best to keep it the same length. Note that you
can only move it in multiples of 8 pixels. You do this by adding a number 
(which is a multiple of 8) to the 4th and 5th columns of your configuration.

(The 1st column is the name - something like        "1024x768"
 the second is your pixel clock rate in MHZ  eg        75
 the third is the visible line length in this case    1024
 the 4th is the start pixel of hsync     eg           1032   --> make bigger
 the 5th is the end pixel of hsync eg                 1096   --> make bigger
 the 6th column is the total line length in pixels eg 1328
)

If you installed SLS there would have been a nice document there telling
you how to do this :-(

Happy hacking.

Not another one telling me to learn C...  :-)

Actually, I do already know a bit of C, and have done some commercial
development in C++.  I just like Pascal.  :-)

And anyway, I don't want to rewrite the kernel...

Comments:

* YES, I know that this count is a severe undercount, because

  a) not all Linux users can send E-mail
  b) of those that can send E-mail, a lot don't read c.o.l.announce

  Nevertheless, this count has already passed the previous largest real count
  of Linux-interested people (the c.o.l split vote, which had 1842 votes).

* YES, the allocation of "com" to the US and "bitnet" to "the world" is
  more or less arbitary. I will think about getting a better split across
  countries in a week or two, but at least, we get an idea.

* I don't think letting people register others into the count is a good
  idea. How shall we know whether two people are registering the same friend?

* I count users, not machines. BBS users, who neither know nor care that
  their BBS is running on a Linux system, should probably not be counted,
  while "dialin UNIX" users with E-mail access probably should be. I will
  think about counting machines some time later (probably not before November).

* So far, at least 38 of the replies from the counter have bounced. This
  means that 1.7 % of the mail has problems. I consider this good!

One more word:

PLEASE crosspost the vote request to local newsgroups, BBSes and the like!
I believe many German Linux users (for instance) would read mostly their
"own" newsgroups, and would get the information by such paths.

From X.400 networks, the addresses

S=linux-counter;O=uninett;PRMD=uninett;ADMD= ;C=no
S=linux-counter;O=uninett;PRMD=uninett;ADMD=uninett;C=no

might work.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Very likely.  I don't think there is any general way to do what is being
discussed.  Where the BIOS stores the actual video parameters is completely
up to the BIOS, and there is no standard, as far as I know.  Hence I don't
think it can be automated.

It is possible to determine this by disassembling the BIOS and finding
where the tables are located, but I consider this an ethically questionable
practice, so I have never done this.  What I have done is write some
DOS-based programs to extract register values for a given mode.  This
has served to allow me to develop a relatively successful set of generic
modes, which will be included with XFree86 2.0, along with a new document
on how to get up and running.

Basically, we have modes that should provide a working, if not optimal
(in size and positioning), set of 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, etc
modes for any monitor.  I think.  Some very old, or esoteric fixed-frequency
monitors may not work with these modes, but there has been no case
where someone on the XFree86 beta team wasn't able to get at least
one working mode at each resolution from the set.

The idea is to get people up and running, and then let them tweak
size, position, refresh rates, etc, based on the detailed documentation.

I assume that you have either a stripped twm and unstripped fvwm
binary, or some libraries are staticly linked in fvwm and not
in twm. Here are some sizes on a sun4/SunOS4.1.3 for comparison

All binaries are stripped, all except mwm are dynamically linked,
all use the same library releases. The xpm color icon libraries are
statically linked. Note that sun-4 binaries are typically somewhat
bigger than linux binaries.

Hi,
I'm using SLS 1.03, 0.99.13, and the 'time' command
complains about using old stat system call.
Where can I find the source to recompile?

I would also be very interested in a Linux magazine.

This may happen some day.  Remember that eps is based on mctex.  I
didn't write this and don't completely understand it.  I think I found
the place to put hooks in (I think it needs to go in the mctex lib,
not in my code), but I don't know what all the different parameters
mean (dvimag?  usermag?...), so I haven't tried it yet.  In principle,
if I knew just what font was needed, putting in the required system()
or fork/exec is trivial.
