This is an _EXCELLENT_ idea!!!

I've been messing around with VGA stuff a lot lately, and it would be nice 
to be able to do this.

90x25 mode, for example is _trivial_ to implement on an VGA (not even SVGA).

Also, while we are at it, how about some ioctl()s/escape codes for changing 
pallettes, etc.

Hi, I'm am wondering if it is possible to have a video grabbing
capacity on linux. What I'm interested in is to have a camera
connected to linux via a card and for linux to get frames off the
camera and send it down the Internet line to an X-window program
on another unix workstation for displaying.

  Have anyone done this before? If so I'm interested to hear how
they did it. Also I'm need some advice in this matter, any advice
is welcome. Thanks for you help.

Lucid 19.8 on Linux

I've built the 19.8 vesion of Lucid emacs without much trouble.
The fixes are taken from 19.6, mixed with GNU emacs19.21's linux.h.

Compile with gcc -O2 shows that speed is quite good.
Font-locking a ~4k line C++ file takes 23 sec. vs. 18 sec. on
un-optimized lemacs on Sparc2. 

shell, ange-ftp, rmail all work fine. 
Since I'm only 1 week new to Linux, I would like some auditing on my
patches. if you're interested in the patches. Drop me a line.

SLS seems to have been abondoned on the net.

1.04 was released on cd-rom a while back, but was
never uploaded to any ftp site. 1.03 is still
the newest version available.

If you are serious on upgrading, I suggest you use
the Slackware distribution. It is an outgrowth of a project

The current slackware contains Xfree 2.0 and all the niceties

As an old friend of mine once said 'This looks like it calls for VODO

I have a HandBook 486DX2/40 myself (just got it two days ago). It runs
Linux very well, and X works fine.  Suspend and resume features work
flawlessly on my machine (don't know what's different about mine versus
Liz's HB).  I have experienced no hangs or crashings as a result of
using suspend/resume (in fact, I have experienced no hangs or crashings,
period).

Anyone who would like a copy of my Xconfig may have one - just send
me mail.

The system is quick, the display is slow (as one would expect), the
EZ-Point pointing device is nice, but takes a bit of getting used to.
Battery life seems good: ~2 hours average with no PM, several hours
with PM.  I find it ideal for use as a demo system, something to take
notes on in meetings, and for general use at home and work.

My only complaint is that GW used a display with an odd aspect ratio,
causing everything to appear "squashed".  The display is still quite
usable, IMO, but I would have preferred if it were a bit smaller with
a "correct" 4:3 aspect ratio.

If anyone would like any more info, feel free to send me email.

Now, if someone has any info on PCMCIA support for Linux they'd like
to share, I'd be extremely grateful!

  Does anyone know what chipset the 2842 uses?  I'll be working
on a driver for the 2742, but I haven't seen any specs for
the 2842, so I don't know if it also uses the same aic-7770 ASIC.
If it does, most of my code could be used.  You'd only
need to write a wrapper that initializes the 2842, as I only
have info on the EISA 274x series.  If it's the same ASIC
and I have time, I could try to write any needed 2842 code, though
I wouldn't be able to test it myself.  I've also heard of motherboards
that have the aic-7770 builtin.  If anyone has docs on how such
a motherboard addresses the ASIC I oculd try to get that working
as well.

Reply-To: ucjtrjf@ucl.ac.uk

I've just got Linux up and running (thanks to slackware ;-) and am a very
happy camper. I've a seperate mail if you want to know how happy.

Anyway, i have a question about speed. An application, in C that we run on
our Sparc SLC/ELC's gives `time' results as below, as does Linix.

SLC% time cs
20.1u 0.8s 0:25 80% 0+180k 4+0io 2pf+0w

Linux 486sx/25% /usr/bin/time cs
20.25user 178.88system 3:20:69elapsed 99%CPU (0avgtext+0avdata 0maxresident)K
0inputs+0outputs (0major+0minor)pagefaults 0swaps

Linux 486sx/25 (csh builtin)% time cs
19.76u 179.51s 3:20.11 99.5% 0+0k 0+0io 48pf+0w


So we have roughly:

Machine                 CPU time        System Time
===================================================
Sparc SLC               20.1  s           0.8  s
Linux 486sx/25          20.25 s         178.88 s

The cpu time is impressive - but what is the system time for?

Now this job does do a lot of maths - has a small competitive connectionist
network in it. Is the system time somehow including the maths support? Or is
the system doing loads of other things?  This was run on the console and in
an X window, with simmilar results. I even killed all but one of the getty's
(as it's a stand alone machine) so ther is only a minimum of jobs running.

On other non-numeric jobs (prolog tasks) the cpu time is 1 - 2 times that of
the SLC, so very impressive.

Any ideas on the above though? Thanks, Jonny.

I have received a number of replies from people whose 1542C`s work fine with

..................

        The problem is that with the >1Gb roms in the controller, you need to
send some special command to "unlock" the thing.  As far as I can tell, this is
just a magic command that you use so as to tell the controller that yes we
really understand that you have the >1Gb ROM.  Without this special command you
get the "Interrupt received, but no mail" message, and the controller is
unusable.  All of the documentation that I have read suggests that Adaptec does
not recommend that you use the >1Gb roms on a non-DOS system.  Also, none of
the technical reference manuals (either for the 1542 or the 174x) explain what
is needed.  I have sent email to an Adaptec developer asking them about this,
and my queries have been ignored.  For now, my position is that since this is
apparently an unsupported configuration as far as Adaptec is concerned, I am
not interested in trying to patch the 1542 driver to try and use the extended
mapping.

        If someone can convince me that Adaptec does support extended mapping
with various forms of unix, *and* they can pry the relevant technical details
out of the hands of Adaptec (no mean feat), I would consider patching the
driver to make use of this.  I am not interested in spending a lot of time on
the phone arguing with Adaptec myself.

        Yes, I know all of this.  You should not use these ROMs with linux.
