They imply that Linux will run Windows programs.  That is simply not
true (yet).

They do not mention that the DOS Emulator doesn't work for many programs.

They advertise ELF binary compatibility, but I believe that ELF is still
ALPHA software.

They do not mention that Linux is still BETA software.

This ad is misleading at best.

Whats the deal?  I've install MCC pl10+  and XFee86-1.3.  I have a cheapo
NE200 clone card (Allied Telesis).  Within 20 minutes of installing the
base package and tcp/ip I was ftp'ing the X stuff.  Within an hour of 
installing X I was displaying remote X stuff with no problem (xrn, xmh, netrek ;)

I have no problems - none!  Except that the pl10+ memory management is kind
of sophomoric, but it works if I dont try to display a 2000x2000x256 jpeg.

I ftp, telnet and display remote X all the time - and I've only crashed once, due
to the memory management.  After reading messages like the above I'm in no big
hurry to update.

Amazing...  Simply amazing.  After fixing a few ERRATA, the TAMU.99p12+

Now I'm trying to refine my X server, such that it will work as advertised.
I'd like to have its default screensaver do the "X" logo, just like the

Where do I *put* this option?  It didn't work in [...]/xdm/Xservers .

Date: 28 Sep 1993 19:49:49 +0200

Hello,

well, what follows is my opinion and not an order :-)

Oki, there are some things that this PC *must* be:

- It must have a processor 386sx/16 or higher (intel, amd .. whatever)
- I think you must have at least 2 MB RAM
- A Harddisk bigger than 20 MB (for basic systems)

You will not get very far with these minimum requirements. I would suggest
you get a 486dx or dx2. A 386 can do it, too, but as you will need to
compile a lot with linux (kernel updates all the time), you better go for a
486, since 386 are not much cheaper. For memory: get 8 MB if you will not use
X windows and 16 MB if you want to. You can run X with 8 MB (even with 4 I
heard), but it won't be very pleasant. Harddisk: get at least a 245 MB drive,
IDE or SCSI. Get SCSI if you want to use several disks, cdroms, scsi tapes
or if you simply want to ensure you can move the HardDisk when switching to
another computer system (which will support scsi for most cases). Note: IDE
drives are not slower than scsi ones (well, depends on what model of course).
Monitor: get at least a 15" model .. I would go for a 17" monitor, which is
ideal for 1024x768. The video card: get an accelerated one. Linux runs
with most cards, X with many. I would suggest an S3 chip based cards, since
they offer good speed at good prices. Avoid diamond cards (well, not all are
bad, but you won't get into trouble hopefully without a diamond card).
Especially don't buy a viper: this one is fast, but will maybe never get
drivers in Xwindows. I'm using an orchid VA vlb, and it gives me great speed
under Xwin (there are a *lot* of other nice S3 cards, the best are the S3 928
based ones). Floppy drives: at least a 3.5" drive. Buy a 5.25 drive only if
you need compatibility to your friends 5.25" disks or similar. Then, get a
mouse (needed for Xwin or selection, a cut'n'paste "driver" for terminal use).
Linux supports many mice, even bus mice.
Note that I didn't cite a minimal konfiguration, but with this system you
will have no problems originating from hardware. An estimated price would
be ranging from 2000 to 3000 US$, you may even find it for less (also for mor
:)). If you need more details, send me a mail or ask people on #linux in IRC.
Hope I helped you a bit.

Philippe

PS: I would not buy anything less than the above :) It's more expensive at the
    start, but you won't regret it.

   Well, to some extent, yes. I was tinkering with both OS/2 and NT
   to try to determine some of the RT characteristics of both to see
   if they would be suitable for a wave-soldering control system
   that I've been puttering with. A previous iteration of the
   control system ran under vRTX, so I used that as a reference
   implementation. 

   Hardware base was a 25Mhz 386/387 ISA bus clone w 16M real memory
   and 100M SCSI2 disk on an Adaptec SCSI controller and a General
   Instruments GPIB controller to the instrumentation bus, and a
   486/50 with 32M real memory and the same SCSI disk and GPIB
   board. Process times on the applicator station need timer control
   intervals of 50 usec +/- 4 usec for reliable reaction to overtemp
   or bad flow conditions. Below are some very rough results based
   on my home-grown execution profiler:

   Definitions (so everyone agrees on what's being measured): 

   sample size is 100 executions

   OS == the obvious
   timer skew == deviation from scheduled interval time using OS
                 timer facilities (no custom assembler or external
                 heartbeat timer used) Permissible deviation in this
                 case is +/- 4 usec to avoid component damage.
   avg interrupt latency == delay time from trigger condition to
                 first instruction of interrupt handler for device.
   avg interrupt service = total execution of interrupt service
                 (trigger to ready to accept trigger. interrupt
                 service routine executes only code to push measured
                 value into input process buffer and posts data
                 available to another process via an OS semaphore)

   Both OS/2 and NT measurements are with GUI running (to keep it
   fair) and with the process fixed in memory if possible (at
   minimum, marked non-swappable). The actual instrumentation setup
   is the same for both OSes. 


   OS   timer skew   avg interrupt latency   avg interrupt service
          (usec)          (usec)                 (usec)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   vRTX    +1              3.364                    24 
   OS/2    +2.25-+3.2      5.52                     31
   NT      -2.17-+4.77     5.14                     39

   Timer facilities in NT are of widely varying accuracy, although
   the OS/2 timer functions appear to vary in accuracy depending on
   the underlying hardware. The NT timer exceeded the deadline more
   than once, which made an awful mess of my bench space (8-(). It
   is a curious artifact that the interrupt latency time appeared to
   be somewhat shorter with NT, which I attribute to a better device
   driver for the GPIB card (the OS/2 driver still has a few
   gremlins). The vRTX implementation was rock solid and right on
   the money in every test (nice work, folks!) -- no detectable skew
   on the measured values in all 100 tests.

   Development facilities were a lot better on OS/2 than NT, but
   that's probably a function of OS/2 being out longer. Some kind
   soul (whose name escapes me at the moment) has tipped me off to a
   CD of the GNU tools for NT, which I'd expect to improve the
   tools on NT considerably. It was considerably more difficult to
   get the NT process locked in memory, mostly due to poor
   documentation, I think, but it took a lot more experimentation.
   The IBM last stage optimizer in the C compiler also is overall a
   bit better than the MS one -- it's proportionally slower, but
   makes very nice code. I'm also somewhat concerned with the
   limitations in NT with what system facilities can be called from
   a storage-fixed process -- some important stuff is somewhat
   difficult to call from a memory-mapped process, like semaphore
   manipulation. 

   I'm working on some more interesting results with a real
   application, which might be worth writing up if people are really
   interested. Based on what I've observed so far, I don't see NT or
   OS/2 displacing the vRTX and QNX user base for critical hard RT
   systems -- soft RT, maybe, but it'll take quite a bit of work.

It is possible to speculate on what the ave. interrupt latency and

No. The process could be setuid to wizard while entering the directory, then 
revert back to stupiduser before opening the file.

A general solution would have to use ACLs (access control lists).
You'd have to attach an intersection of X's file permissions and all ACLs of 
directories you traverse to get to file X, to /proc/fd/.../X.

Meanwhile, I've thought about this for an hour or so now and there indeed 
doesn't seem to be a clean and secure solution. :-(  The best I've come up
with is to disable access by other processes to any file descriptor which was 
opened when uid != suid (saved effective UID).
If that check is disabled when accessing your own file descriptors, i.e. 
/proc/self, then any use by shells etc. would not be affected.

I'll implement some patches.

Do you actaully have to send anything? If not, why not simply connect TD to 
CTS on the caller-ID side?

If yes, you'll have to hack the kernel. Posix(?) says there are supposed to 
be TIOCSBRK / TIOCCBRK ioctl calls which set / clear the BREAK signal, which 
is just another name for a continuously-on TD wire.
You should be careful not to send anything else during that time, of course.

You mean apart from using the stupid zcat|tar pipe when tar has a perfectly 
workable "z" option?  ;-)

Of course there is. There always is. But you're going in the right direction, 
and most questions I see around here are of the "I screwed up (even though I 
don't admit it) and now do I get my system back without reinstalling 
everything" type which you can't answer in a HOWTO file anyway.

However -- right up front, suggest that people cd to /tmp and start to learn 
about "gcc" by reading its manual and a good book or two. This is because 
they'll run into errors fairly soon. Mostly stupid errors like nonexistent 
header files or small typos made when configuring things, but errors 
nonetheless -- and asking the net when confronted with such things isn't 
really a good idea.

I've been using MCC pl10+ for a few months now - it works great except for
the memory management.  I'd like to upgrade to pl12 or 13.  I've tried both
kernels - which boot fine, but give me:

        SIOCADDRT: Network is unreachable


I get this with both pl12 and pl13.  I've seen other people mention this, but I've
seen no solutions.  Does anybody know what causes this and how to fix it?
I'd really like to upgrade my MCC!

Thanks in advance,
Dan

What kind of bullsh*t is this. Now this article looks like something that is
going to promise a bunch of things that linux can't provide (yet!) and piss
off maybe thousands of people who will respond to this ad and not get what
it advertised. Can't people experience Linux for what it is, a great and free
operating system that has delivered us from the hands of Microsloth, instead of
just looking for a way to make a quick buck.  I don't think we want people
putting this kind of trash in magazines. At least if your going to do something
like this, be honest in the ad about what people are getting, and let them know
all the options, such as getting it free. I'd like to see people take a stand
to uphold the integrity and reputation of what linux has become.

        I gotta know the answer to this, and It is nothing life threating
        <or linux threating>. When I boot, I get a "36.09 BogoMip <tm>". 
        My question is, just what the hell is a "BogoMip". Is it similar
        to Mip <God, please say its true.. All bow to the god, linux>, but
        figures with the co-processor or something? I gotta know.....
