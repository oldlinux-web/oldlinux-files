Help!!!!!

Setup : SLS 1.02 Distribution of Linux 99pl9 on 
        Dan Technologies 486DX66/2
        4Mb RAM
        CL54?? (Cant remember!!! Not important) 1Mb SVGA Card
        XGA Monitor.

Ok.... 

My problem is this.... Linux absolutely chews the RAM memory down to 40k
and then starts swapping..... however thats well and good but anything more 
intensive than 'ls' locks the machine proper......

Now... we've upgraded to 8Mb .. much better but still it chews up the RAM
to that 40k mark.... this from the OS with the 4Mb Max-overhead.... 

So it seems... the more memory I stick in... the more it'll chew.... (standard
UN*X trait anyway).... but then what do I about my X... :((((

Also.... the memory management seems to be very dirty... with some programs
leaving their footprints in memory long after termination and the kernel not
tidying up...... (Mind you... the X server is great at doing this.... hence 
my current kludge when I'm really stuck is to startup X and then quit X)

The question is this.... any way to make linux 
a) Tidy up memory better 
b) make sure there is alway 1Mb free RAM.
c) anything that'll allow me to tell the kernel to swap out a chunk of memory
   on command......

Anyone got any suggestions ???


All answers on a postcard to vaughanj@itdsrv1.ul.ie :)))

We have 6 linux boxes (4 x 486's, 2 x 386's) on our net which are
up almost all the time and another 4 (2 x 486's, 2 x 386's) which
are up some of the time and run OS/2 or Hybrid (a locally developed
microkernel) the rest of the time.  All are connected via Ethernet.
There are a further 2 which dial up occasionally via SLIP.

Hello!

I have removed all "C++" Styles from the ftape-package, 
patch a clean 0.99p13 Kernel and compile them. All works 
fine.
But when I will make insmod driver.o, I always get a
kernel error 1. If I run rmmod, I get the error
"delete_modules" not implemented. Does anybody know, what
I have make wrong? Or better, can somebody post the patches
for pl13 or put them to sunsite or tsx? Then must not everybody
make all the things.

Thanks

Hi,

        Does anyone have a Hints file for Linux? I'm trying to compile
 perl 4.036 on my box, and Configure thought it was on a very
 deficient machine ... I thought I'd ask before making my own hints
 file. 

        thanks

Hello fellows!

As the title states, I'm looking for a driver for a HP-IB board. I
remember that some time ago someone wanted to write one, but I don't
remember who it was. So how is the state? Usable already (I just need
the most simple behavior to copy data from a device into my machine).
Thanks!

Warning! This area is a "No Man's Land" that might be in use. "Almost
always unused" is not good enough. CHECK if this is the case on you
machine before installing the above mentioned boot loader.

For example, my machine uses this area of the disk to store the disk
geometry; the BIOS reads it at boot time. If this info overwritten the
machine will most probably not boot at all.

Hello, all!
No even thousand mark passed this time.
But I'll be away, or too busy to work on this, for about 2 weeks
now, so I thought I'd just post this.
Registration seems to be levelling out at about 35 E-mails per day,
at this speed it will take us 7.5 years to register 100.000 users.

I intend to post this on the 1st of every month in c.o.l.misc, but
haven't yet found a piece of software to do posting from a script.
(Hint, hint....)

Registering other people, to allow registration of non-Email users,
is awaiting 2 things:

- Time to implement something
- A deep thought about the privacy issues involved.
  Discussion on c.o.l.misc of this is encouraged!
  
(In particular: If I publish, is privacy respected? If I don't publish,
how can people tell that others have registered them more than once?)

To join the count, send a message to linux-counter@uninett.no (NOT TO ME!!!)
with the subject lines

   I use Linux at home
   I use Linux at work
   I use Linux at home and at work
   I don't use Linux

(the last one is for the one who just wiped Linux off his harddisk and
went back to MS-DOS :-)

In all cases, you will get an E-mail with the current count back.
Mail from the same address will only be counted once, so if you want to
change your vote, just send another mail.

Happy Linuxing!

        I am as of yet unfamilar with linux (other than I know what
it is). I have heard of people running X on it, but no real opinions
about how it worked.

        What I am looking into is making a portable X-Term, by buying
a 486 laptop installing Linux and X-Windows on it, then connecting it
to the Ethernet. Does this sound at all possible?

        What I need to know if it is, is:
1)      what size HD to get? (Are there any problems with various HDs?)
2)      Are there any problems with network interface cards?
3)      What would be the preformance of such a creature?
4)      Is there a NFS for Linux?
5)      I know of one place that sells laptops with the nice palm rests,
        are there any other companies that have integrated the palm 
        rests into the design? (Palm rests like the Mac Powerbooks.)


        Please respond to my e-mail. Sorry if this is not the appropriate
newsgroup for this, please be kind and direct me to the appropriate news-

I have the WU-ftpd 2.0 running under 0.99pl13. I tried WU-2.1c
and it failed miserably. drop me a line if you are interested,
or if there is enough interest, I'll upload the source and binaries.

FWIW, it's running on my linbux box ftp site right now (archive.phish.net)

: Warning! This area is a "No Man's Land" that might be in use. "Almost

The accompanied README.1ST file contains a big warning that you
shouldn't use this BETA version if you are not sure whether these
sectors are free. This is why this file is called README.1ST.
Anyway "almost always" means that there is a very good chance
that these sectors are free, but you should check it.

What kind of machine is it? Tandon, Compaq, Zenith or something like
that? I ask because "modern" BIOS's store the disk geometry in the
CMOS RAM or not at all if you use SCSI (like 1542B/C etc..)

Silly humans...everyone here in the Galactic Federation knows that 
Agent Torvald's initial stands for "'Bot" :) :)

Hallo.
======

I want to get Linux from a ftp-server. So I have two questions:

(1)     What is the actual version-number of Linux

(2)     I have a PC 486/50 with a 340MByte harddisk and 4 (soon 8)MByte RAM.
        Is it enougth to work with Linux (can I use the compiler and X-Windows)?

I hope anybody can answer my questions soon.

Bye Schini.

- Which distribution did you install and what did you do to make it
  secure?

SLS 1.03,... dumped out all the configuration files in /etc and re edited
the permissions on some things (Peter, where was /conf? 8-) bad mistake)
Also incorperated the authd patches, kept the system local for 2 weeks
while attempting to hack into it (got some friends to help)
fixed some more file permissions

- How many users does your Linux system have?

minus the admin stuff 43 and growing at the rate of approx 4 new users a week
I operate the 'as you need it' system. at any one time there can be anything
from 0 to 14 people logged in and about 8 sessions to various ports (mudders)
the system has 16Mb ram and 16Mb swap of which I've only ever seen 2Mb of the
swap being used. Filesystem size just under a gig of local disk and
approx 3gig nfs

- Is the net code stable for professional Internet connection?

well if it isn't I've not seen any problems with it so far

- Any other problems/hints?

no *real* problems (hardware or other machine problems) just the usual
headache of remembering what the format of some files are and accidental
chowning

24hr internet (ether) list so far is
        w9bgx.nuars.nwu.edu     (129.105.5.88)
        hook.eecs.nwu.edu       (129.105.5.117)
        ramius.eecs.nwu.edu     (129.105.5.92)
        worf.toppoint.de        (193.174.3.11)
        zen.btc.uwe.ac.uk       (164.11.2.18) (me)

start adding your sites folks..
