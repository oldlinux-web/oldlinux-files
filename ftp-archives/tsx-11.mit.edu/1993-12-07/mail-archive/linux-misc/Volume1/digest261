Just as a warning, I noticed the  startx script included is broken.
If you select "exit" with the twm menu, you will have problems
killing your Xwindows session without rebooting.  The simple solution
is to change the exec command to the window manager (as traditionally
done) instead of an xterm window.  If you really want your session to
die when you logout of one of your xterm windows, then something more
compicated will be needed.  (Perhaps elminating "exit" from the twm
menu...)

Fortunately the only damage this bug does is caused by the forced
reboot without umount -a.

If this is the new Headland chipset its supposed to actually be quite
respectable.  Basically, I think it simply comprises a fair fancy
banked/interleaved interface that enables main memory to run roughly as
fast as the usual (rather mediocre) secondary cache.  The best test for
performance, however, would be to run a decent-sized CPU/memory
intensive program and compare result with other machines.

(I could be wrong about headland but *someone* has recently brought
out a ``cacheless' [34]86 chipset...)

I am thinking of buying a EXB-4200 (or EXB-4200C) for my LINUX box. I saw
your name under support so I decided to ask a few questions of I may.

a) How do you feel about the EXB-4200 (or EXB-4200C) support ?
b) I have a UltraStor 34F SCSI controller that I will daisy-chain from
   are there any known problems in this configurations.
c) Is there support for EXB-4200C ?
d) Is there support for EXB-8200 ?
e) why would one buy 8200 (usually more expensive) compare to 4200 ?
f) Is there support for any other DAT tape drives ?
g) Is the driver for EXB-4200 fairly mature ?

Since the drive cost about $800 - $900 I want to make sure that I could
use it effectively. Thanks in advance.

Sincerely.

    In the bay area, a FULL TIME slip connection to the internet costs around
    $80/mo (plus between $0 and $400 initial startup, depending on the 
    provider), and there are no per-packet or volume fees.

    Time-connected fees are ok for part-time slip connections, but anybody
    who charges you per-packet or volume fees for SLIP or PPP is taking you 
    for a ride.

    I strongly reccomend AGAINST using a 14" or 15" monitor for 1024x768
    or greater resolutions... not only is everything too small, it is VERY
    bad on your eyes!  You wind up having to move closer to the monitor and
    thusly get radiated, and having to focus closer in isn't fun either.

    If you intend to run 1024x768 or greater you need a minimum of a 17"
    monitor or your eyes will be paying for it in a year or two.  I'm currently
    running 1024x900 on a Nanao FlexScan F550i-W, which is a well shielded
    low EMR 17" $1000 dollar color monitor.  If I wanted to run 1280x1024 I 
    would probably have gotten an even larger monitor.  Shielding is must for 
    anybody who stares at a screen 18 hours a day :-)

    For a 14" or 15" 800x600 is about the best you can do and still use the
    same perscription, and if you see 20-20 now you definitely do not want to
    loose it!

    If your a kid, use the above argument to persuade your parents to help
    you out getting a better monitor :-)

Well, Waffle is neat and all that (coming from the MS-DOS world), but
Waffle's principle use is as a BBS-style news gateway.  Given this, I
can't figure out why the *hell* anyone who's running Linux would want
to run BBS software to implement stuff that already comes with Unix.

A much saner implementation would be to implement a BBS-style shell
that calls that actual Linux applications for the user via a simplified
interface.  This would prevent every bbs user from merely being user 'bbs'
on the system and would allow Linux to do the things it was meant to do --
like really being a multi-user OS.

Anyway, the point of this post is to point out that someone not too long
ago suggested implementing a BBS shell for Linux (via perl scripts perhaps?)
and to ask how this is coming?  Has anyone gotten around to it?

BTW, if you want a full-screen, curses-based, Searchlight(tm)-style BBS
you might want to look at porting PBBS (Pirates BBS) which you should
be able to find somewhere at msstate.edu (among other places).  But again,
why run a bbs.  Why not just give out shell accounts and offer services
via menus or some such?

ncurses is now at level 1.8. don't get any older versions. Don't use the
ncurses that comes with SLS, it is broken. Make sure you remove it and
install a fresh copy of 1.8.
You probably should get ncurses from netcom.com:pub/zmbenhal as other
copies may have a typo which prevents compiling.

assuming you can access the hard disk you can use
tsx-11:/pub/linux/dosutils/bootlin4.zip to start linux from a kernel image
on whatever disk you want - this does not help if you don't have a linux
partition to start though.

I agree in this case, though sometimes the questions obviously label the
questioner to not be trusted with the root password :-)

BTW I would also like to see a package which would let us extract files
from our linux disks whilst in DOS.

The console uses the latin1 charset (ISO 8859-1). You can convert files
between different charsets with the utility recode (from GNU/FSF).
recode can be found on most ftp servers.

   This is not a problem with the startx script.  It is something to do with
either your .xinitrc or the one used as the default.

   I actually prefer exiting from a window rather than the window manager.
The reason: I sometimes like to switch or restart my window manager.

   You do not need to reboot to exit from X, you can use the
CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE (backspace, NOT delete) sequence to kill the X server.  If
you have other virtual consoles you can use CTRL-ALT-(F0..F8) to select
another.  You can then log in and kill the X server.
   If you really get stuck and you are using the SYSV init you can issue a
shutdown using CTRL-ALT-DEL - that should take the machine down cleanly.

I have been using a borrowed external DAT drive on my Linux box with an
Ataptec 1542C without any problems.  The drive is actually an Archive `Python'
and is capable of doing compression. I've not used the compression features,
so I am not sure the Linux SCSI tape driver can turn it on.  The unit was
originally purchased from BoxHill Systems Corporation, 161 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, NY 10013.  Tel: 212 989-4455.  This company provides
excellent (some call it `legendary') technical support.  I have no affiliation

So far the list is:
