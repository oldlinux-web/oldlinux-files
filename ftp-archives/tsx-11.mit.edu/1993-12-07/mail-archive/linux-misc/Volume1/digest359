Wow!  You had "advanced" tools like that?  I remember doing it with DEBUG

Well you can make Linux boot single user (root) off of the harddisk

Yes, you can set the squashroot thing so that root can not write or even

helps, thought me a lot of things.

Yes you can, it would be much the same thing though if he attempted to do

Hmmm...  Lets see here:
   Pay for 6 CD's / year for two years.

   Recieve 1 CD on time, one three months late after waisting lots of time
   contacting Jay.  And having the the flustration of knowning a third
   was supposed to have been sent, but will probably never arrive...

Win 1 CD which you will never see, and probably endup paying shipping for
anyways...

It sounds like the like the Winner of the CD is comming out ahead.  S/he
will only loss a few bucks and have minor agrivation, compared to forking
out a hundred bucks for major agrivation.

NOTE: They still don't respond to e-mail...  I guess I'll have to call again...
and again, and again ...

Although I have to admitt, I probably hopelessly confused them by moving after
recieving the first CD and informing them of it.  I didn't make the same mist-
ake twice, i.e. I won't tell them I've moved again.  (A regular occurence
for students...)  I'll just be happy when I finially get them to send a CD
to my old address.

Hi, I currently have a Roland SCC-1 Sound Canvas (General MIDI) card and
a Sound Blaster card in my computer.  I am now running Linux 0.99 pl.14
and have compiled in MPU-401 and SoundBlaster support (but no GUS
support).  All SoundBlaster stuff work fine, but when I try to play MIDI
files with adagio (mp), it plays through the SoundBlaster FM, not
through MIDI.  If I specify "mp -f midifile.mid", no sound comes
out.....

Is it a problem in the kernel compile or the adagio compile?  Or is the
real MIDI card supported at all?

Subject: Network interface lockup problems with Slackware (Nov 8th)
Date: 1 Dec 1993 04:39:22 GMT

I recently installed Slackware (dated 8th Nov).  Everything went
smoothly.  Good job by the Slackware people! I installed from the
network via NFS and it went real fast.  5 minutes network configuration
and the system was up on the network!

The machine is a 486SX33 with a 3COM 3C503 card.  Its configured to use
DNS via a server.  Most everything works fine, but the network interface
locks up very often.  When this happens, you can't ping it, but rarp
appears to work, cos the MAC address appears on my Suns' cache.  On the
machine itself, it runs fine except the network interface appears to be
dead.  You can telnet to itself fine (via loopback), but nothing via
eth0 works. 

NFS and the rpc stuff is enabled, and our network is pretty busy.  Could
that be a clue? I've also had occasions where portmap suddenly spawns
dozens of zombie processes for no reason.  This ties up all the
processes, and I get a 'can't fork' message and can't do anything. 
*sigh*

I've tried installing the PL14 kernel, but it still locks up. The next
step is to disable all the rpc and NFS stuff, which I'll try tomorrow.

I used to run SLS 1.0.2, and got that to the point where the network
stuff was reliable. The current networking stuff looks pretty solid, as
long as I can find out what causes this lockup.

Well, while I've got your attention, some other networking related stuff
I've encountered;

I use remote printers and use printcap to point to them. They work,
but lpq always give a message of 'connection to xxx is down', where xxx
is the print server. lpr actually works ok, although the status file
in the spool directly is always left at 'sending file to xxx'. It
never changes to 'file sent to xxx'. The file IS printed out. lpc
reports that the queues are all up.

The rwhod always appears to die right away. Any ideas?

Having not made any changes in about 8 months, this upgrade was very
painless.  And the benefits are great! Kudos to all involved! To be able
to install via NFS, configure, and bring up networking and X in about 30
minutes is astounding!!

Does anyone try the ALPHA-pl13r kernel from nic.funet.fi with PAS16 soundcard 
and SCSI hard disk? 
When I tried to boot up with zImage (compiled from source ALPHA-pl13r
at nic.funet.fi, under directory /pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/pl13-ALPHA's,) 
it gave me a message "Patition check" and then hanged. 

From the messages linux giving, I can tell linux successfully 
detects my PAS16 card, my scsi harddisk(seagate ST1480N 400MB), 
(since it gave  a correct description message of the scsi harddisk). 
BUt after that, it gives the message "Partition check",
and everything seems dead (i.e. the "Num Lock" or "Caps Lock" doesn't
work and Linux  keep polling SCSI harddisk.)

Anyone has any idea of what's going on?

That is, after the first 3 months, most of the testers will think that

See what happened to comp.sources.reviewed, which was based on more

The most common way to get people to do boring things is to pay them,

Hi netters,

It seems that shutdown is not doing a proper sync before shutting down.
I have done a e2fsck on my linux partition after booting from the SLS 
installation disk.  When I reboot linux from my harddisk, it works ok.
However, when I do a 'shutdown -r' (after doing a few syncs), it always 
reboot with a 'mounting uncheck partition' error.  Is this a bug of shutdown?

Subject: Re: [Q]Faster SCSI patch
Date: 1 Dec 93 10:30:28

I used the patch successfully against the 0.99pl13q ALPHA kernel,
where the directory structure for the device drivers was allready
changed. 

As the result, I would guess it nearly doubled the speed
of my 386DX25 accessing a *very fast* DEC SCSI-Drive (DSP 3133L),
with an Adaptec 1542A.

In the meantime, the newest kernel is 0.99pl14. I checked the
patches out some minutes ago and found that they do *NOT WORK*
without adjustments:

-- Some SCSI-Bugs have been fixed, allready:
                linux/drivers/scsi/sd.c  (Hunk #11)
                linux/drivers/scsi/aha1542.c
                linux/drivers/scsi/aha1542.h
        You can savely ignore any reported errors on these files,
        do not apply reverse patch!

-- Others only work, if made by hand (because of other changes):
                linux/drivers/block/ll_rw_blk.c (Hunks #1 and #2)
                linux/fs/block_dev.c  (Hunk #1)

You apply the patches with the ... patch command ... 
(you allready guessed it :-):
        cd /usr/src/linux
        patch -p < /where_the_patch_is/kernel.diff

(I allways apply the patches inside of an Emacs-shell window,
so I can scroll back, to see if something went wrong.)
Compile the kernel, compile the bdflush process and install it,
install the kernel (keep a backup copy of your old kernel and update,
just in case ...) and boot. That's all!

Good Luck

For use as a server 8 MB is enough. More memory will not buy you any speed
under this use. Once you start big programs like gcc or xv you will notice
swapping delays (xv with a big jpeg picture can get a size of 8 MB or more.)
I would not use such a system for serious program development under X, but
otherwise it would be accecptable (about the same as Windows with 4 MB and
modern big application programs).
