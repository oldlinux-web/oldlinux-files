I just got mine as well.  Interesting - no silk screening at all, makes
it pretty hard to guess which side goes up.  It appears to be a copy
of the tsx-11 site as of Aug. 26 as well as some next stuff and a copy
of the slackware 1.02 distribution.  Not exactly breaking news.
But at least I got something and this time I can read it on my cdrom
drive, unlike the last one.

No more misleading than the original poster's.

The orignal poster said that a 486 "doesn't have nearly the raw
processing power" of a SPARC 10.  I'd rate this statement as very
misleading.  Most SPARC 10's out there are single CPU's.  They may
be on the order of twice as fast as an average 486, but there exist
486's which are faster than a significant number of 10's.  That was
the statement I made.

Great!

I was just thinking on such a thing for ext2 fs. The idea just came in after
a HP-UX troubleshooting course where I learned about fsdb (FileSystem
DebuGger). I was just wondering in anybody did it for the ext2fs already,
otherwise I would like to take the chalenge.

The advantage of having such a tool is important (even in view only mode)
we had test cases where answering yes to all the questions of fsck will just
try fix the WRONG things (after all fsck is not an expert system).

I'm considering buying one of those Linux CD-ROM distributions that are 
starting to flood the newsgroups. 

Since I have full (and free) access to all Linux sites, is it really worth it 
to buy one? (Except for the obvious relief of not having to shuffle 25+ 
floppies).

Please, anyone who's got one of these CD-ROMs, let me know your opinion. Thanks!

As a command, "imake" by itself will do nothing correctly without arguments.
xmkmf's supposed to supply arguments telling imake where to find the
configuration files.  You can take a look through it to find where it
passes the -I argument to imake.  If the directory named in that argument
isn't where your config files really are, imake won't be able to find the
template file Imake.tmpl and it won't build your Makefile.

Creating an empty Imake.tmpl won't do any good.  You need the real X
config files.  You can get more information from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in /pub/imake-stuff and /pub/imake-book.

You can also buy Motif for Linux if you like non-free software.

The X server  has nothing to do whith the look of your screen, XFree86 is

Date: Fri, 19 Nov 1993 22:10:08 GMT

Hi !

I'm looking for a database program which helps me to manage my CDs/records/
tapes and DATs. So it should have the normal functions of a CD database
program (or should be able to be programmed like this) but should manage
all those different medias. The program doesn't have to be designed 
especially for CDs it could also be a normal database program.
It should also have some functions so that I can print a list of the CDs
(in LaTeX would be the best) or it shouldn't be too complicated to 
realize such a function...

The database should run under Linux (perhaps X11), but also hints for MS-DOS
are welcome...

Any hints ?

Thank you in advance,
Stefan

Subject: HELP! Need Xconfig settings for ATI GUP !!
Date: Sat, 20 Nov 93 06:54:43 GMT

Hello from a new Linux User:

I am very recent entrant into what I hope is the exciting world of Linux.

I have a 486/66 ISA system with 16MB and ATI GUP with 2MB video memory.

I installed the SLS Distribution 1.02 on my machine. I bought the CDROM
from Trans-Ameritech ... incidentally the installation was very easy ...
all stuff was installed directly from the CDROM.

I was able to install Linux on my machine successfully .. almost:-)

I tried to pull up xwindows ... by running 'xinit' and I got a whole bunch
of errors ... upon further investigation I found the 'Xconfig' file to be
the culprit. The chipset defined inside the file was a 'et4000' !

Also all the other stuff was messed up.

The SLS distribution also came with the default kernel. I assume it has the X11
stuff in it. I am ISC Unix user ... and I find things kind of different here.

what is the command for configuring the kernel ? (ISC Unix> kconfig)
what is the command to configure the X window system ? (ISC Unix> sysadm xmgmt)

I dont mind modifying the files manually .. if I know what to do ..

I would like to hear from someone who has successfully installed Linux on a
system using the ATI Ultra Pro w/ 2MB.

PLEASE e-mail me a response ... I was hoping to atleast get a glimpse of the
X window screen ... 

p.s I have a feeling that X windows drivers are installed in the default kernel,
because I ran X386mono and I got a out of sync screen (maybe because of incorre
mode)

THANKS IN ADVANCE

Subject: Questions
Date: 17 Nov 93 23:29:53 GMT


Someone else with questions!  Isn't it your lucky day?
I installed Linux a couple of weeks ago, and have some questions that
hopefully someone can answer.

First off, I'm a fairly heavy-handed typist, and the keyboard repeat
delay and rate are way to high for me --- I end up getting lots of
"stuttering" in my typing.  Looking in the source code for the keyboard
driver, I can't for the life of me figure out how the key repeat rate
is set --- is the repeat actually done in hardware?  It is not nearly as fast
in DOS....  The key repeat rates for the X server didn't do any good
at all (but were also documented as maybe not working).  Does anybody
know a fix for this?

My other problem is one I'm hesitant to ask about because I haven't
fully explored it yet, but as long as I'm posting about the keyboard....
I'm getting strange behavior out of LILO --- I've got it set up to
boot DOS by default (yeah, yeah, I know....  but I want starting up
the machine to be as painless as possible for my wife).  However, after
booting Linux, the very next time the machine is booted LILO always
starts Linux instead of the supposed default of DOS --- it only happens
once and then goes back to booting DOS.  What is happening???

Many thanks to anyone who provides help...

It is.  I can myself attest to that.

Current Linux setup:

Machine A:

   486DX2-66 VLB
   16 Mb RAM with 256K cache
   400 Mb IDE hard disk (16 Mb /, 340 Mb /usr and 47 Mb swap for Linux)
   ATI Ultra Pro VLB video board (1 Mb)
   SMC Elite Combo Ethernet board

Machine B:

   486DX-33 ISA
   16 Mb RAM with 64K cache
   200 Mb IDE hard disk (30 Mb / and 16 Mb swap for Linux)
   ATI Ultra video board
   SMC Elite Combo Ethernet board

Machine B mounts /usr via NFS from machine A.  Machine A provides a
lot of network services, such as distributing the linux-activistists
mailing list via NNTP (using INN) and serving as a home for several
mailing lists, some rather large.

They really rock... each machine cost about $3K when we got them (A
early this year, B early last year), and they are being put to heavy
use every day.  Machine A, in fact, was bought specifically to run
Linux.  (The reason it has 47 Mb swap is that I initially thought I'd
better leave a DOS partition on the system... it doesn't use more than
maybe 12 Mb of it at the most).

Another machine I run is a 386DX-16 with 3 Mb expansion bus RAM and a
40 Mb MFM HD running Linux.  It works, and it usable, but occationally
it locks up due, apparently, to RAM problems.  I will hopefully get a
40 MHz MB with 4-8 Mb really soon now... :-)

=============================================
I have a plug-in card that uses my VCR as a backup tape drive. It writes
the data three times, and it requires the use of good quality tape at the
highest tape speed SP, but it has only a bit failure rate of one hard error
per 100 million MEGABytes!! It was made by autofax, which used to be in
Scotts Valley, CA, and it is called the "Imager". It operates either on the
entire disk or on selected subdirectories recursively. I can get about
80 MB per 120 minute tape. Not fantastic, but I traded some junk for it.
I don't use it often, not as often as floppies, and I have turned to
backing up software packages in installed form rather than just copying
file after file. But it did safe my ass once, so it was well worth it.
There may be better ones on the market now, for all I know. But with so
many good and fairly cheap tape drives out there now, my next tape backup
would not be VCR! The company is no defunct, sorry.

Oops, sorry - the name's Alan Osborne.  The anonymous 'root' wasn't
a pathetic attempt at anonymity.  Anyway, there's help and there's
bootlicking.  I've seen far more sensible questions from a naiive 
student somewhere being treated with absolute derision, some quite
hostile.  

I just don't like aspects of human nature as demonstrated by this 
example, but I'm glad to see you have a sense of humour :-)
