  Linux is a freely distributable Unix(R) compatible operating system
for the IBM(R) 386/486 PC and compatibles written by Linus Torvalds
from the University of Helsinki, Finland.  It was developed by a
unique world-wide collaboration of programmers over the internet, and
is covered by the GNU General Public License.  Linux is a modern, high
performance network operating system, much like ones used for years on
engineering and professional workstations.

  The Linux from Nascent CDROM is an entirely new distribution of the
Linux operating system, and includes over 400 mbytes of source code,
binaries, and documentation for Linux and applications.  The Linux
from Nascent distribution features:

* 52 page User Guide
* automated root, swap, and package installation from CDROM
* simple user account and network administration scripts
* Linux 0.99.13 plus net-2 networking
* extensive online documentation and manuals
* network printer support
* X Window System(TM)
* OpenLook(TM) 3d window manager
* SCSI disk and tape support
* TeX(TM) and ghostscript word processor and viewer
* Ingres database management
* GNU C compiler and utilities
* GNU emacs, vi clone text editors
* sound and graphics support
* Over 100 high resolution images translated from Kodak PhotoCD(TM)
* magic and spice electronic design tools
* GNU Chess, Shogi, pooltable, xpilot, flight simulator, ...
  
  The Linux from Nascent application archives have been organized
using a consistent makefile interface; the vast majority compile and
install without modification.  Each archive comes with an associated
notes file that lets you browse collections of archives to see what's
available, along with its current status, and includes simple
instructions for compiling and installing an application.

  A listing of the contents of the CDROM as well as a current copy of
this announcement and order form may be obtained via anonymous ftp at
netcom.com:/pub/nascent.  An order form is also included below.

This is an interesting number.
If we, for instance, assume that:
- Only Ix readers are registered in the Linux count
- All German Linux users are Ix readers
- The average proportion of registering/nonregistering is the same in all
  other countries,

we get:

German registering proportion   : 530 (today)/7500 = 7 %
Total count (today)             : 3172
Total Linux population          : 3172 / 0.07 = 45.314

Of course, if we assume that only half the registered Linux users
are Ix readers, to be counted in the 7500, then the numbers
become:

German Ix readers registering   : 265/7500 = 3.5 %
Total Linux population          : 3172/0.035 = 90.628

(Note the inconsistent use of the dot. I've been dain-bramaged
by American cultural imperialism to the degree that I write "dot"

I'm sorry, this is not right.
The damage that UUCP mailers do to the envelope FROM address is
IMHO a misreading of the intent of this field, and mailers that
construct such misleading envelope FROM addresses should be reconfigured.

In most cases, both From addresses are the same; in several cases,
the From: header field is not replyable, so the message bounces.

The reason that I did it this way was that there is a small degree of
lesser risk to registering the envelope "from" address (which is controlled
by the mailer) than registering the header "from" address (which is controlled
by the user). I've already had mail that I *know* is faked (even though they
managed to fake both fields).

A "My country is" field is planned for the next version, but I refuse
to even *consider* giving a date for the installation of this.

BTW, there is only one vote registered for the ru.ac.za domain.

Also, you might like to post this kind of announcement to

Unfortunately the registry doesn't allow multiple registrations (yes I know we
could cheat), because my department has just bought 20 Viglens that are used
to run linux, and I know of at least 7 other Linux boxes around the research groups.
Unfortunately they are used by REAL users, rather than us Hacker types
and therefore they don't read these newsgroups. Any way of letting sysadmins
vote for all their users?

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Its true that this works on Sun vi and not on elvis 1.7. I have no idea
why, but I bet someone in comp.editors would know (hint, hint) :)

This won't work because dd is not a ex command. <number>dd while in vi
works though, but doesn't answer the original question.

interaction.  What we need to do is distinguish between the
types of questions we are trying to direct to comp.os.linux.help
and the sorts of questions acceptable everywhere.  For example,
questions starting "How do I...?" usually belong in the help
group, but "How should we (re-design the schedular to eliminate
thrashing when running out of swap space)?" or "What do you think
of this idea (for re-designing the scheduler...)?" should be
acceptable in the development group.  Questions like "Do you
want me to (distribute my PCMCIA drivers)?" are acceptable anywhere.
My point is that the directive "Please don't post questions here"
is absurd.  These postings need to be re-thought and re-written.
