An interesting note: Ghostview 1.5 with Ghostscript 2.6.1 will
only see the first four pages of the Meta magazine Postscript
document.  Ghostview 1.4.1 sees the entire document.  I
discovered this when I downloaded and compiled Ghostview 1.5
after reading the Meta issue with Ghostview 1.4.1.  Fortunately I
stashed the 1.4.1 binary and now have both available.

Why will it not diverge to a completely different product if it can't be 
updated with "official" patches? Is there any intention to head towards

Do not get a Diamond card. Diamond uses a proprietary method of
setting up the vga clocks, and they do not disclose the information
how to use this hardware to the public. Therefore XFree does not 
support Diamond cards.

        I am looking for a software management/installation tool for
use on my home unix system (running Linux).  I don't need any special
features beside the basics of being able to easily install and
de-install software from either independent directors or tar files.
Anything that deals with multiple users checking files out, or NFS
mounting remotely is probably going too far beyond my needs, unless of
course I can still do what I want to do without being bogged down with
too many other details.

Don't count them, except if these users mail you individually...

My /etc/passwd has more than 250 users, most of them using Linux (or
downloading it at least...!).

This is my private machine and phone, and I pay the mail, but when you
started your count, I told them that I will pay for everyone wanting
to be registered as a Linux active user :

        I'm the only person who did vote :-(

I can't force them, neither I can send you my passwd file :-)

Your counter registers people who really want to be registered, not all the
linux users: This is not too bad, finally. So this postmaster should just
ask his users to vote, and let them do what they feel...

Keep ONE count for this site: The Operator showed us that he is ONE active
Linux user :-))

This seems to be a popular comeback.  But let's face it  - LINUX is a hacker's
toy and is great for a small segment of the population that is willing
and able to devote the time, energy, and money to getting it to work.  For
that small segment of the population, XFree is a good thing.   Also, let's
get one thing straight.  LINUX and XFree are not 'free' - minimum cost
of putting this combination on a PC is $75 for hardware (you really need
100 Mb of disk space, and current prices are $.75/Mb), but can be much
greater if your hardware needs to be upgraded to comply with the narrow
range of options supported under this environment.  We could also add in
the cost of the dowload time+diskettes or the CD-ROM, but that varies
all over the map so I won't bother.

For the remaining 95%+ of the PC market segment, XFree is a non-viable
option.  These folks need to run off-the-shelf, supported software and
do not have either the time or the expertise to mess around with the
free UNIX variants like LINUX, etc.   For these folks this comeback is
a slap in the face, not a constructive answer.

So, let's phrase an answer for these folks.  There is no such thing as
a free X-server software for mainstream, commercial, vendor supported 
PC operating environments.  For those who need/desire to run one of
these machines, there are commercially available X server products at
prices ranging from moderate to expensive.

For DOS or as a DOS client under MS-Windows, the least expensive option 
at the moment is X-Kit from XLink Technologies (Milpitas, CA). Current
price is $199 (including TCP/IP), or $135 for educational groups.  GraphPoint
in Cupertino, CA also has a low price entry, running in the <$200 range,
including TCP/IP.  GraphPoint has the advantage of having separate DOS
and Windows packages, and has the disadvantage of being a 16-bit implementation
(X-Kit is 32-bit).

For serial line only connections, NCD and Hummingbird have packages at
about $150 each for PC's running DOS/MS-Windows.  

For educational groups, DesqView/X value pack is $125/200 (DesqView/X,
QEMM, Network Manager, and LAN WorkPlace for DOS) [first 5 copies are
$125, then $200 for each additional copy].

For OS/2 users, IBM has a TCP/IP base product with an X add-in.  Total
price for the latest version is around $350-400.

There are numerous other options; anyone interested should check out the
X Journal or UNIX World to see the wealth of available options.

If that is so, then you need to avoid these dealers like the plague.

i also have a 386SX pc, but most of the components were purchased before
Linux existed, so there is incompatibilities.  I am going to be sure
that any subsequent machine I purchase will consist of components that
will work with Linux as it probably will be the only OS I will consider 
running.  It'll probably a very fast 486 machine, probably all SCSI for

Recently, I read in c.o.l.announce about a mail-order company selling
machines tailored to run Linux well, and they even installed a tested
version of Linux.  If they are a good company to deal with, I would
recommend you buy a setup from them; that way you ensure that all the
components you get will run happily with Linux.

I wouldn't necessarily consider 500 users at a particular site running Linux
as 500 separate users.  In my opinion, a user of linux is a person with
a machine running linux, either at home, or at work.  A guest on a dial-up
Linux site doesn't equate in my mind to a Linux user, at least for
vote-counting purposes, since the object of this vote-counting (unless
I'm confused) is supposed to count the number of installed linux systems.

Furthermore, if the site is on the internet, there could be several folks
in their passwd file who telnet from other sites, and could possibly
be running linux from any one of a number of systems, and that would 
be like voting twice (or more) in my opinion.

: BTW, the current count (including perhaps half the 500 users) is now
: about 3.700 users.

This becomes more important since the number of potential votes (depending
on what you choose to do) is such a large percentage of votes you've
already counted.

  Reading this file with 1.4.1, all the colors get "slashed" by white lines
on it's first load.  Everything is fine if the doc is reloaded.  Wonder if
this might help in figuring out why 1.5 ain't working right.  I haven't
tried 1.5 nor 1.4.1 on the Suns yet.
