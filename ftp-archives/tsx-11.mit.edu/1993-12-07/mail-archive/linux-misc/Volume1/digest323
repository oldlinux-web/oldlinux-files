I also have one of those Digicom Software Upgradeable modems.  I have found
that the software downloaded to to card will survive a warm boot.  Therefore,
if I plan to use the modem, I boot DOS, download the software, and then reboot
with Linux.  Maybe the downloading program will work under the DOS emulator; I
haven't yet compiled the emulator.  If anybody has successfully used this
modem without first booting DOS to download the software, please let me know.

Hello,
        I am looking for information regarding hooking Novell-based LANs
to a Unix network.  I have a background in Unix, and recent experience
in Novell 3.11, but have little idea of how to interface the two.

        I need information fairly quickly, so if you can give a summary,
with pointers to more detailed descriptions of how to do it, I would
appreciate it.  Any information is helpful.

        The hardware concerned is an RS/6000 i believe running AIX,
connecting to Novell 3.11, but information regarding any flavor
Unix host (even/especially linux too!) will help.

Thank you,

Troy Hildebrand

I have the same card, and after speaking with the people who sold me my
system, they said that even with the 1542 driver you're still getting
the full speed performance. The reason is that the BT747 loosely emulates
the 1542, but does full busmastering transfers. I did some iozone timings
and discovered that was more or less true. Of course, none of this is
very scientific.

I'd love to know more about this board. It seems to have trouble talking
to a CD-ROM player I bought (SCSI-1, IBM PS/2 box, I forgot the actual drive...)
Linux boots and the BT747 detects the drive, but accessing it generates
tons of timeout messages (in the SCSI sense values)...

Or even better - Let's write (minimal at first) Ethertalk support 
directly into the kernel rather than use the Packet Filter. The 
problem with packet filter is that it is too dumb ... erm ... at 
too low level to be really efficient. 


I think a good startegy might be this:

        1. First implement something that gives the same kind
           of service for CAP as the PacketFilter does. That is -
           if gives raw ethernet packets of AppleTalk-type
           for the application(s) (and clones them if necessary). 
           After that you can use CAP.

        2. If the speed does not satisfy you or if you want the
           implementation to be "nicer" then start moving
           the appletalk protocols from CAP code down to
           kernel.

So - why does it need to be Berkeley Packet Drivers? We do not
actually need the generality of them. All the protocols I could
think of using within 5 years are TCP/IP, IPX and AppleTalk

The question is - are there any people interested on this? (or is 
there allready some ATALK-channel that is doing this). I could
give help.

I find the interactive performance of LINUX (non-scientifically measured)
to be fine.  However when there is a lot of disk activity going on, the
performance drops dramatically.  This surprises me, since I have a SCSI-based
system (adaptec 1542b).   Maybe the SCSI stuff isn't optimized well yet?

Just remember, though, that when you want to buy Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect,
MathCad, or IslandWrite/Draw/Paint, you will have a tad of trouble finding
it for LINUX, whereas it's "stocked on every distributor's shelf" for the

It all depends on what you want to use the machine for.

Well, you'd have an even easier and cheaper time finding these and all
sorts of cool packages for DOS and/or Windows. And when these packages get
ported to Linux, chances are they'll be much cheaper than for SPARC.

On the same hardware, FreeBSD is a touch faster than Linux for the
things that I do.  These things are compiling C++ libraries and
interface builders.  It is a wash as far as I can tell for Linux vs
FreeBSD on how fast ObjectBuilder comes up.

My system is a DX-33 w/32M of memory.

It is about 80% the speed of my system at work, as measured by compile
times for the OI library.  The system at work is a Solbourne Series
5E using one CPU.  When two more are used, my home machine is about
25% the speed of system at work, measured using the same metric.

You have misunderstand semantic of protection fields.

Of course users can delete root's files if files are in directory which users
have write access. Creating or deleting file requires ability to modify
directory (ie. write access to directory). Deleting don't touch file's content 
(except that one directory entry for that file is removed and if it was last
 directory entry (ie. link) to that file, file space is freed.) So write access
to file isn't required (other words: to deleting file you need not write to 
file.)

(And I am again commenting myself).

Perhaps that helps about semantic of protection field: 
Think directory as file which have two things - file name
and pointer to file. 

Directory's protection field protect that content.
File's protection field protect that content which are in end of that pointer.
So if you want remove file you need only modify content of directory
which is protected by directory's protection field - you need not go
through that pointer.

(And this is metaphor! So do not complaing that if I don't mention all 
 details how this is really implemented in unixes.)

Odd.  I'm running a 386/25, and no matter how much disk activity
(swapping or otherwise) is going on, interactive performace is great.
If a process is swapped out, of course, there'll be a .5 second delay
before I get a response, but after that things fly.

I use that feature all the time.  I often want to run a program in the

I assume the reply is a joke, the point being that speed of an OS
depends upon the hardware configuration.  My own experience and that
of others on the net is that Linux manages to get reasonable
performance out of minimal hardware, and performs very well indeed
with good hardware.  Performance seems to be better for given hardware
than most other Unix or Unix-like systems.  There are two cases where
one might complain about performance (1) if your hardware isn't right
for what you're doing.  E.g. you probably want 8MB if you're going to
run X.  There are certainly machines on which you could get reasonable
Microsoft Windows performance (assuming you weren't running anything
big under MS Windows), but X under Linux would be terrible.  However
if X under Linux is terrible on a given piece of hardware, X wouldn't
be any better (and would probably be much worse) under other Unix
clones.  (2) if you have problems with BIOS settings.  A few people
have reported bad Linux performance, and it's turned out to be bad
settings of obscure parameters in the BIOS.  Again, I believe other
Unix implementations and Unix clones are likely to use the processor
similarly to Linux.

Under most situations, Linux performs very well indeed.

hello, I am having trouble trying to uncompress things using tar -x.  The 
error I keep on getting is /dev/rmt0 is not present.  I checked the /dev
directory and it is there.  What am I doing funny?  

Thanks for any advise...Mike

        As I have said before, I do not find it surprising that the Bustek
EISA boards in the 1542 emulation give much better performance than the 1542.

        Anyway, there is a native driver for BusTek boards under development,
and very soon people will be able to try both and see what the actual
difference is.

        The sense buffers can be decoded and they provide a lot of information
about what might be going wrong.  Lots of timeout messages from a cdrom can be
a symptom of a number of things.  You might want to check:

* Bus termination.
* Flakey scsi cable.
* You are not overloading the power supply on your system.
* Thumbprints on the cdrom.
* The laser head is clean (you can get special cleaning discs).
* The SCSI mode page for error control is not set up to retry read errors.

-Eric

With very inexpensive power supplies that come with clones like what I have,
running too many things at the same time can result in a lot of data errors on
a cdrom. Unplugging some unused things seems to help quite a bit (actually at
the moment I have an external power supply connected to my cdrom).  I do not
have a good sense of where the actual problem lies - it could be noise coming
through because of poor filtering, or it could be cheap power connectors that
do not make good contact.  I used to have an NEC drive that would
intermittently give me all sorts of trouble, but when I put in a Dell box with
SVr4 it has started working like a champ.  The Texel drive that I replaced the
NEC with is also giving intermittent errors.  Anyone have a 300W Dell power
supply for sale? (-:
