It's time... I'm finally going to upgrade my computer from an AMD 3286/40
to an Intel 486Dx2/66 and I'm going to do it by simply switching to a new
motherboard (as soon as I kill my wife and get MY money back :-).

anyways what I'm looking to buy is a EISA/VESA 486dx2/66MHz (unless people
suggest this wouldn't be the fastest route) motherboard and was wondering
which manufacture and chip set is the fastest for running Linux, I plan on
putting 16Meg of memory in it.

So would you please send me your top two (if you have two) choices for best
motherboards and the reasons why you like it so much. This way I can decide
what to purchase. (also replies of the "DON'T buy this motherboard..." are
also appreciated)

If I get some useful results from this message I'll tabulate the results
and reasons and post back to this group.

thanks for time and effort,

I don't know if this is already known but I have exactly the same problem.

I think I've seen a message saying that some Cirrus clone boards are bad.
May be we have both such a card.

I have another question. Before my VLB 5426 based video card, I was usind an 
ISA Paradise clone with XFree 1.2. And I now, it seems that my new card have
lower performances. This is specially true during scrolling in a xterm that
is full of text. Is it the same for every one having a 5426 board ?

...ok, so don't flame the pants off the poor guy. Help out a bit -- describe
what you updated and how you did it. I think his document fills a need --
sure people can go and get the next dist. of SLS or Slackware (...as *you*
would like them to.) but this does not give any room for people to create
their own environment if they mkfs all their changes away every 2 months.
And what about people who want to "roll their own" ??? Trying to do things
themselves may open up more possibilities for errors, but it also gives the
person a chance to *actually learn* something about how things work. If 
all the linux users were just brainless lemmings that relied on pre-packaged
systems, then I don't think that you would see the rate of development that
Linux is experiencing.

Don't get me wrong -- the packaged distributions hold a vital role as well.
They can be used as delivered, or expanded/modified etc. But don't try and
ram it down people's throats. Most of the Linux questions that I answer from
local users here are things like John's HOWTO describes. I think it would be
great if I could just point them to an on-line document instead of repeating
the same stuff all the time. Good effort John.

Hi,

I'm interested in the new Gateway 2000 4DX-33.  I want to know if 
linux & Xfree can be used on this machine.

A sales person told me that the new Gateway 2000 4DX-33 uses Intel I4
mother board and on board Cirrus Logic graphic accelerator.

I could not find the mother board in the linux HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY
LIST.  I could find the name of Cirrus Logic in the supported device
in Intel-Unix-X-faq.  However, I'm not sure if I can use Xfree86 with
it, since I have no knowledge about the factor which may affect the
compatibility of graphics.

Does anyone have a comment on this combination?

I got it today.  Three weeks after my order was placed, and 2.5 weeks
after my card was billed.

Unfortunately, there were two problems with my order.  One is that the
video board I ordered was on back-order.  They solved this by shipping
a generic SVGA board that I am supposed to ship back later.  Hopefully
they will include postage.

The real problem is that I ordered an Adaptec 1742 SCSI board, and they
shipped me an Adaptec 2742 board which is totally incompatable.  As I
want to run unix and don't have any prospect of a driver for the 2742
board, this hurts.

The solution was to return the Adaptec board, and they will refund me
the $200 premium for this board, and send me the default scsi board.
I'll pick up the proper board from a local store tomorrow (they can't
get it tonight), and all will be fine (I hope).  It only costs me
time and money (about an extra $180).

Other than this is seems to be ok.  It runs DOS and Windows.

We have DOS benchmarks and Windows benchmarks for comparing different
VLB graphics adaptors, but what about for linux? Many people post to
comp.os.linux.* asking about which video card to get, and the responses
are typically not much more than "this card is real fast" or "this card
I have seems slow" but one never sees objective (and rarely even subjective)
comparisons between cards. Granted, few people have an opportunity to even
play with more than 1 or 2 video cards, but is there some way to benchmark
and gather data on every card out there? Is there some program that would
do a good job of this, and then have every linux user (or those who are
willing :) post or email their results? Then we could compile a list which
includes street prices and people would be able to find the most suitable
price/performance for them. 

How DOES Cirrus Logic, S3, ATI, Diamond compare? Does one offer a low cost
board which under linux beats one of the others high-end boards ? 
Enquiring minds want to know! :)

How about it? :)

If you can wait a little longer, a PCI board is probably your best choice. 
This bus will probably replace VLB and EISA in the next one or two years. But 
at present nobody seems to know, whether the current linux kernel runs on a 
PCI board. I did just see the first ads for PCI boards. At present they are 
$250 more than a ISA/´VLB. But they come with high performance SCSI integrated 
on the motherboard. This is a one chip solution from NEC rivaling the 
performance of the Adaptec 1742 EISA adapter :-). But the linux driver for 
this controller probably is not yet written :-(.

    No, when I started out with linux, I didn't have a clue. Just ask
some of the people who helped me by mail. Unlike a large majority of the
readers of the linux groups, I'd never been near a university or a
computer lab.

    Well, don't you think that might be why I wrote that little
document? If you have any suggestions on how it could be made clearer so
neophytes don't find themselves with problems they can't handle, I'd
welcome suggestions.
    Strangely enough, I have always found my system quite stable, and
the only reason I upgrade is to get a new feature that I'd like. 
Adding a package at a time simplifies debugging, as far as I'm
concerned, and I cetainly think it would have taken me a lot longer to
track down the bash-elm bug if I had of replaced my entire system.

 Besides, I can tell you that *a lot* more

    Some people like to be able to say they have the latest revision of
everything. Others are quite happy if the versions they have work, and
see no need to upgrade already working programs. How many of the changes
you made were absolutely necessary to get a functioning system.

The following patch to /usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c subtracts the

Well, I have to disagree with you (or rather agree with Tim on liking
it).  This is based on my experience at work (and a day or so away from
having it at home).  I love SCSI.  It's not much more complicated and
allows a lot of flexibility.  Just be sure your controller is SCSI-2
and not just SCSI.

# comments show a great deal of misunderstanding about what "scsi",
  ^^^^^^^^
Who's comments?  I found the basics of Tim's post to be good.  Hey
with his disclaimers, who could fault him  :-).

# "scsi2", etc really ARE.  Better dig considerably deeper before you
# assume you understand what they are.

Always a good idea, but SCSI-2 is a fairly safe bet.  SCSI peripherals
(before SCSI-2) allowed for too many differences in the interface (thus
the old way of having a separate and a ...kinda proprietery SCSI
interface for each manufacturer's devices... YUK!).  But with SCSI-2,
the vast majority of drives are just plug and play.  The
incompatibilities that one might find may be no worse than with any
other standard.  IF YOU BUY SCSI and plan to use it for more than one
specific peripheral BUY A SCSI-2 CONTROLLER (be sure it's SCSI-2, not
just SCSI).  A SCSI-2 controller can talk to a SCSI (1) device, but
very likely not the other way around.

# There are advantages, 

Fast, future expansion capability, God, printers and scanners are using
these things now.  There's even SCSI standards that will let more than
one computer share a SCSI bus (OK, Adaptec won't do that.. to my knowledge).

# but there are costs.  Weigh them.  Then pay your
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Ouch, you know how to hurt a guy :-).

Then again, it's not so bad except up front.  If you share your SCSI
interface with CD, 2 or more hard drives, tape backup and maybe one
more thing, the cost of the interface may end up saving you from buying
tons of interface cards.  The nicer SCSI controllers will controll up
to seven devices (3 bits, 1 id taken by the controller, leaves 7).

# #1 consideration is this:  Do NOT expect VESA level performance from SCSI
# running on either EISA (my system) or ISA.

Now this I do disagree with.  God how I wish I could remember the review
I saw, but the EISA SCSI killed the VESA one.  I don't know how many tests
showed this, but at least in that test it was.  I also saw another (maybe
more recent) test (Maybe PC Mag?? was on stands last month) that showed
the Future Domain beating out a couple of the VESA SCSI's and the FD is
an ISA.  No doubt LB is fast, and I wish I could afford one since I don't
own EISA.  (Anyone know when FD is putting out a LB SCSI?)

Could you have had a particularly slow EISA SCSI?  I don't understand this.

# #2 is cost.  You can get one heck of a decent system for less money.

True enough.  One could argue from other points of view justifying the
SCSI choice (which I made, and am impatiently waiting for), but this
cannot be refuted.  IDE with inexpensive tape drive and a sound card
with CD-ROM interface... cheap and works well.  (Anyone want a Colorado
Memory Systems Jumbo 250?  Make me an offer, I'll be tempted to sell.)

Tim said:
# There are 3 types of SCSI-2 - fast SCSI-2, wide SCSI-2, and 
# fast & wide SCSI-2.  Fast SCSI-2 is here now, and when most manufacturers

Actually (insert standard disclaimers) SCSI-2 is a standard.  Wide and
Fast are like extensions to SCSI-2, and they can go together.
Peripherals can negotiate the protocol to use (although if you have a
wide scsi peripheral, I think it cannot talk to a "narrow" scsi
controller, although I suppose the peripheral could be made to be able
to do that.  It would then just "agree" to not be "wide").

# talk about SCSI-2 they really mean fast SCSI-2.  Wide SCSI-2 is just

No, they mean normal SCSI-2, not fast.  Fast is 10MB/s whereas normal
SCSI-2 is 5MB/s

The SCSI gurus here tell me that FAST SCSI is not that big of an
advantage.  I'm not sure why because the transfer rate sure does seem
better.  I don't know if maybe this transfer rate is only obtained in a
small percentage of the cases, rendering the lack of performance.

I wish I could afford Adaptec's new VESA SCSI.
