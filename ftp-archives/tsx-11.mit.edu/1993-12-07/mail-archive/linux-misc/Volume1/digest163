        As I understand it, X11R5 lacks the necessary hooks upon which
one would hang a user-defined screensaver program like After Dark.
I saw an announcement somewhere that X11R6 would correct this.

Date: Mon, 27 Sep 1993 23:30:14 GMT

  Am I just being overly sensitive, or are there other people disturbed
by the way Linux is being represented/misrepresented in magazine add's?

  First there where the 'Linux Systems Labs' adds that have been appearing
in the UNIX magazines.  While not to bad, I find the fact that it say's 
$59.95 for CDROM or 30 disk distribution in the upper right hand, and 
Motif now available in the lower left hand somewhat irritating.  Still at
least they say that it is Linux ver. 0.99.

  What really bothered me though was when I was thumbing through my new
issue of 'Byte' that I just got in the mail today.

=========================================================================

                               SOFTLANDING
                              LINUX SYSTEM

                     SLS: POSIX UNIX clone for the 386
                     As reviewed in March "UNIX WORLD"

              Includes: * full kernel source * X11R5 Openlook * TeX
                 * emacs * TC/PIP, NFS&SLIP * complete C & C++
           development environment * 600+ utilities * SVR4 ELF binary
              compatibility * Windows 3.1 API & ABI * DOS Emulator

=========================================================================

BTW the TC/PIP isn't a typo on my part <G>.

  What bother's me is what I would think if I was new to Linux, and not 
someone that has used it since January '92.  Here's what I would tend to
think if I was unfamiliar with Linux.

  Start possible newbie reaction:
  "Gee, just think of all the things that I can do with this version of
UNIX.  It's POSIX (assuming I know what POSIX is), it will run SVR4 ELF
binaries (again assuming I have any idea as to what that means), better
yet with this I can run all my Windows 3.0 & 3.1 applications, and use
all those old DOS programs I have laying around."
  End newbie reaction.

  Now let's look at this critically, I get the impression they want people
to believe they developed Linux.  They don't even acknowledge that Linux is
FREEWARE, there isn't even any mention that it is released under the GNU
copyleft.  In fact if I didn't know better I would think I was buying a 
commercial product!  
  Secondly, SVR4 ELF binary compatibility.  Does this even work yet?!?!  
Isn't this still alpha code?  I admit I don't know, I haven't been keeping
up with it.
  Third Windows 3.1 API & ABI, I don't think so!  The window's emulator
isn't publically availble yet.  Admitadly SLS 1.03 contains part of it.
  Forth, the DOS Emulator, it's a nice toy, and I guess you can run some 
serious stuff under it.  Still, it's still so primitive that you can't do
a lot of things with it.

  Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing Linux.  Linux IS my FAVORITE 
Operating System.  Also I like, and have installed at least 3 of the SLS 
releases.  BUT, I am VERY WORRIED about ad's like this doing more harm
than good.  I honestly believe that this ad misrepresents Linux, and will
raise new user's expectations to unrealistic levels.  After actually 
seeing the release, a lot of these people that thought it would be more 
than it is, will junk it and never look at it again!

I once posted this question to the net and got about 30 replies in no time:
with a solution written in _every_ language known to Man.  Here is one of 
the easiest, a couple of shell scripts:

==================== save as dos2unix =================================
#!/bin/sh
sed 's/^M//' $1
=======================================================================
==================== save as unix2dos =================================
#!/bin/sh
sed 's/$/^M/' $1
=======================================================================

Note that the `^M' has to be produced by pressing `Ctrl-V Ctrl-M' in vi, or
`Ctrl-QCtrl-M' in emacs.  Then you can do, e.g., `dos2unix < unixfile > 
dosfile' and `unix2dos < unixfile > dosfile'.

        For what it's worth, you may be having trouble with your 
Sony drive and the Trans-Ameritech CD, but on my Toshiba SCSI drive,
the disk works just fine. The installation went very well, and I've
had no trouble mounting the CD from the hda file system and running
some of the stuff on it. I haven't dug into the CD deeply as a medium
for running programs, but preliminary playing indicates that the 
disk could be a big space saver, properly mounted and linked to 
the main file system.
        As for their service, they told me when I ordered that the
disk would arrive in about four days. It arrived four days later. 
        Regarding cost, the disk is only $30 plus $5 for shipping. 
Where are you going to find a cheaper one (I read about a snapshot
disk of one of the ftp sites, but that's just raw directories and
source). For thirty buskc, you get a choice of three different
linux installation options, all ready to run, a version of 386BSD
for those interested in that *nix flavor, along with a ton of
DOS, Windows, sound and picture files for fun. 
        Having paid twice as much for half the product with none
of the usability or function, I consider the Trans-Ameritech disk
a steal.

        just my two cents...

Is there some difference between this and Softlanding sell a CDROM
(isn't the softlanding ROM more than $59???)?  Why should motif come
as a suprise?  I bought it from metrolink for $200.

I understand a bit of what you are saying, but I don't really see

overlooking something, but I can't see it.

Subject: Re: DOS/LINUX partitions do not agree
Date: 28 Sep 93 02:57:40 GMT

Unfortunately there's no guarantees about partition naming. Some
systems start with the first and some with the last.  If you have more
than one system, any time you use fdisk to create a new partition,
systems other than the one on which you ran fdisk may see a shift in
names.  I don't know any easy solution.  Basically you just have to
get all your partitions made, and then figure out what each system
calls them.  It's not hard to get DOS to see the right partition as
C:.  Make sure it's the only one that's configured to have a DOS
partition type code.  The Linux partitions should be set to something
else.  (It doesn't much matter what -- Linux doesn't care what the
type is, except that it handles extended partitions specially.)

I'm not sure what this means.  Basically Linux doesn't have any
concept of C and D drives.  I just has /dev/hdaN.  The only place
where C and D should exist is DOS compatibility tools such as mtools
or the DOS emulator.  Those are configurable.  For mtools, you create
/dev/dosC (at least in the copy I have) as pointing to the right
partition.  I don't recall how the emulator is configured.

I don't know who is behind this ad (the original article didn't have a
phone number or anything.)  But I am very worried that people are not
getting the right information with these ads.

I have seen a few of these, and it seems to me that the person who put up
this ad is only out there for the money.

I'm amazed to discover something that our VAX does which Linux does
not (appear to anyway). If I use telnet on the VAX to get tothe
University of Victoria, who - poor benighted idiots - use an IBM
mainframe, the telnet goes into '3270 negotiation mode' or some such.

Question: is there a linux-available version of telnet which will
enable me to connect sensibly to an IBM 370-style mainframe running
MVS/ESA, or whatever the hell it's called?

E-mail would be just dandy thanks, as I can't imagine too many people
being fascinated by this question.
