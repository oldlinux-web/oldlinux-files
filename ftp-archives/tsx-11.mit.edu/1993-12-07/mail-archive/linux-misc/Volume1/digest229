ncurses is not an extention to curses, it is a clone of SVR4 curses. Most
commercial systems have some form of SYSV curses, although many stop at R3.
BSD curses is pretty much dead.

It would be easier for people to compile and install ncurses on their systems.

Peter Macdonald either doesn't give a d*mn or wants everyone else to do it for
him.  (So he can sell the result without so much as an attaboy.)

Slackware started its life as a fixed SLS.  Peter responded by *retroactively*
(e.g. "I don't care if it says it's GPL, it's not.  It's proprietary and you
can't use it any more") removing the GPL from sysinstall, forcing Patrick
Volkerding to invent his own (pkgtools) and to withdraw Slackware until he had
done so.  I'm rather surprised Peter hasn't yet claimed copyright on the
format of packages as a further roadblock or something equally incendiary.

ncurses is freely distributeable source code.  If people want to stay with BSD
curses and lock themselves out of the many enhancements Berkeley never
bothered to make to curses, that's their problem.  If they *do* want to
upgrade, ncurses is freely available.  Why is it necessary to try to reinvent
what already exists?

>How feasible would it be to put out source that extends the curses library
>to cover some basic commands that ncurses has, such as keybd() and attr_on()?

attron() is *not* basic in terms of curses support needed; note that BSD
curses can't handle more than one attribute (standout) and that attribute
costs them international characters (because it's the high bit of a byte).
Modern curses uses a long and supports 8-bit characters; retrofitting BSD
curses for this would be a major undertaking and would lose all compatibility.

And no, you can't do it as an add-on, either.  How do you hook into refresh()
to add your hacked-in attributes?  Without reimplementing refresh()
completely, that is --- at which point you may as well retrofit the rest of
curses as well.  Or, much more simply, install ncurses.

When ncurses stabilizes (soon, possibly) it will replace the old curses.  The
only thing you have to worry about in the meantime is if you're running a
distribution (SLS, Slackware, LGX, whatever) and try to upgrade in the
"approved" manner for the distribution:  it'll all go back to being the old
curses.

Hiya,
I use mcopy, mdir and the other mtools quite often and I also
mount dos partitions/disks often too.  The one thing that annoys
me most is when linux CRASHES when trying to access a floppy
when write protected or because it is empty.
(ok this is my own stupidity but hey even dos doesn't crash when 
this happens).  The machine also crashes when trying to unmount a
a floppy if it is write protected and I have written nothing to it.
I am using SLS 1.03 0.99 pl11 so if this has been fixed great and
appologies to all :)
Otherwise is there a patch or something to stop me being so stupid ?

This still won't give you the missing features, keypad() and
extended attributes being the most commonly used.

Excuse me! ncurses is a superset of BSD curses. All the functions
in BSD curses are available in ncurses (with very few obselete
functions). Programs that hack their own keypad functions and timers
will benefit from using ncurses functions instead of their own.

There is nothing wrong with that, although that doesn't make much of
a difference to the issue of porting. Change the Makefile to use
-lncurses instead of -lcurses -ltermcap and change <curses.h> to
<ncurses.h> and you have the same effect.

In /usr/lib/smail/routers, comment out the "match-inet-addrs:" section,
and uncomment the section further down which starts "match_mx_hosts:".

match-inet-addrs tells the mailer to look up the IP address of the host
the mail is destined for, and then connect directly to its smtp daemon.
This completely fails for hosts with an MX record.

The man page states that match_mx_records is a fully BIND compatible 
mail router that does all the proper lookups of MX records.  I can now
send mail to UUCP hosts and other such beasties that I couldn't touch
before.  

All this is documented in the man page, but it takes a whilel to wade
through it.

Some time ago, we approached the manager of a little computer store near
UCLA and convinced him to install Linux on the systems that he sells.
This eliminates the risk and work involved in assembling the correct
components and configuring Linux to work with them.  All the customers
need to do when they get their system home is to plug it in, turn it on
and start working.

I posted this to some of the newsgroups about two months ago when
I found out that they also take telephone orders and ship systems
anywhere in the United States.  If you are interested, you should
call 1-800-486-2020 and ask for Moujan Ahouraian.

                Fax:(310) 441-8869

Moujan installs Linux from the CD ROM distribution by Yggdrasil which
tends to lag behind the latest patch level available on the internet.
He has sold several systems as a direct result of my posting.  I hope
that some of these people will take the time to reply to this posting
and give us their candid impressions not only of the service they got
from 20/20 Technologies but also more generally about the whole idea
of "mail-order Linux workstations".

I am trying to get the people at AMBRA Computer Corporation (an IBM company)
to put Linux on the systems that they sell.  I hope to be posting soon
about their Pentium systems which should deliver performance comparable
to Sun SPARCstation 10 computers at less than half the price.

If you're using the GNU tar, you don't have to specify the tape length,
tar just figures it out.

The version that I have (gtar 1.10) won't verify archives on multiple media,
it fails at the end of the first disk. I tried both with a tape length option

        Well, Slackware does support installation from a 5.25" boot drive.
        But, you must have the 3.5" drive for the installation disks.  I 
        avoided the problem of plugging in all those disks by installing 
        from a separate dos partition.  Slackware will install very nicely 
        from a hard disk, it does on my system.  If you don't plan to use 
        the XS3 server or the Xmono server, just tell it to do it; say 
        no to the option for a prompt.  It's really wild.  If you do it 
        that way, you get a functioning Linux system in just about 7 minutes.
        X might even run the first time.  It really was easy.  Just set up
        your partitions when it tells you to.  The instructions are easy.

Subject: LC port to LINUX available?
Date: Wed, 20 Oct 1993 01:22:51 GMT

Hi all,

The subject says it all.  I did use ARCHIE to search and the latest 
patch dated back to Aug 1992 (Vol 39).  The poster was asking if 
anybody was interested in porting LC to Linux.

Any updated LC?  I've been using LC for 10 years now and am addicted
to it.  LS?  Yuke ...

Thanks in advance.

Cheers,
jim

Well, way back (0.98 something) I installed from SLS, but since then I
have done extensive hacking and just propagated the setup from machine
to machine.  I have used SLS a few times since then; now I'd probably
use the Slackware one.

Security is not that hard; it is mostly a matter of making sure not to
leave any holes open by mistake.  Shadow passwords help immensely.

The net code is OK, I use Net-2D-debugged over 0.99.12 at the time
being, but I am planning trying out Net-2E-beta-2 when it comes out.
There are still problems with it, though, in particular rlogind and
ftpd could really use some improvements.

The absolutely hardest part was that SLS's split between / and /usr is
optimized for a single machine in order to minimize /.  When two
machines are connected with one being the fileserver, as I have here,
a lot of the programs from /usr/bin need to move to /bin.  I
discovered that the hard way, unfortunately.

One of the two machines is a full-time Linux machine, that provides
all services to the network, such as inbound mail, file and print
service, and several mailing lists.  The other one is "rebootable",
meaning we can run DOS on it if we need; it has a 30 Mb / partition
(which includes /tmp, but not /usr/tmp) and 16 Mb swap for Linux, rest
of the HD DOS.  It mounts /usr from the first machine.

The setup supports about 7 primary users and about a half-dozen
remote-only ones.

I think we can do without it at monu1...
it's mirrored at kirk.bond.edu.au
(and also at somewhere at deakin.edu.au if you look at my FTP site list)

Enjoy,
 Andrew.

Facinating.  No disks, the ultimate in "net-ware"!!

But wouldn't that put lots of extra load on the nets?  Seems like if people
had a disk set, they would share it with others and have a way to recover
when things go wrong....  just a thought....
