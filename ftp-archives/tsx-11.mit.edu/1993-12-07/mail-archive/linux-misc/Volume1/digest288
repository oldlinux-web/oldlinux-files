Has anyone had a problem running tcsh under pl13?  I have had so many
problems with the pl12+ releases...  I was using tcsh.6.03, and I downloaded
tcsh6.04 with the same problems. 

Sometimes it gets a SIGSEGV (I think), but most of the time, it ends up as
a zombie, or causes something in my config. scripts to do so.

Let me know..  In the mean while, I'll be tweaking and poking around in pl13,
but remaining in pl11.

Subject: Linux spitting out an illegal IP number?
Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1993 00:42:37 GMT

Hi,
   I have Linux (0.99 pl 11) installed. It is connected to the Internet
   via our Campus subnet. I have been using it for a couple of months 
   without any problem.
   So today our Sys admin comes and pulls off the ethernet connection
   from the back of the machine saying some monitor routines he was
   running traced an invalid IP number being spit out from this machine.
   I have been and was running xterms over the network with the display
   set to my machine. And the ifconfig command also shows the machine
   using the IP which was assigned to it.
   Could it be some program is spitting out the illegal IP ? I am not
   running any weird programs other than xgopher, xarchie, xftp, telnet
   and ftp.
   I am not too familiar with the Network stuff and am clueless as to
   what could be happening.
   Any help will be greatly appreciated.
   Chetan.

Mach runs on lots of hardware.  Some ports are free and some aren't but in
either case you put the OS of your choice on top since it is only a
microkernel.  The Hurd will be one choice.  

alpha and sparcs are done and HP is being done.  This is CMU's list...

>Of course there will be a contest.  May the best OS win!

Actually, I'm not so sure there will be much of a contest between Linux and
Hurd. Linux is a small, clean, highly efficient, simple Posix-style OS for
386 and compatibles. Hurd is intended to be vastly more functional, and run
on everything from a 386 PC on up (pending availability of Mach ports) ---
but it won't be as small, simple, or efficient as Linux. I doubt that there
will be many people at all in the niche that could run either Linux or Hurd,
where you might look to find competition.

Heck, 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD is has more in common with Linux than Hurd has
with either, and the cooperation has pretty well outweighed the competition.

Subject: linux on ibm 486slc2 motherboards, a good idea?
Date: 8 Nov 1993 20:50:22 -0500


Hi, i am thinking of buying an ibm motherboard with a 486slc2- 50 or 66 
processor for use running unix (linux in particular). Can anyone comment on the
likelihood of success of such an idea.

I know that these chips limit you to 16MB ram and have no fpu, but i am more
worried that they might not be compatible with unix for some reason. In
their favor, they take simms two at a time rather than four so 8 MB
ram is possible without getting any 1MB simms (yay!). Also, they seem to
be much cheaper than the intel chips. 

Unfortunately, i have been reading some horror stories about their 
reliability (mostly in ibm valuepoint and ambra systems). so...

is anyone out there using a motherboard with one of these chips on it,
and if so, are you running unix successfully?

please send me email to: macaulay@lyman.pppl.gov

Hold it.  We have to differentiate between Mach 3.0 kernels available
now and Mach 2.5 kernels available now.  The two kernels are certainly
related (having 2.5 simplifies a port to 3.0), but from all indica-
tions, the Hurd requires a strict 3.0 kernel underneath it.  We won't
see Hurd running on NeXT black hardware for a while, for example.

We also need to differentiate between completely free (386, pmax,
Alpha?) 3.0 kernels, and those that require a license.  I suspect that
porting the Hurd to those latter kernels will be a low priority until
the whole thing is reasonably stable.  (Although this will certainly
be done; the situation will be something like running BSD-with-sources
in the old days---buy your Mach 3.0 kernel and the device drivers,
then dump the operating system and install the Hurd with sources).

Subject: Re: [Q] DATAGRAM FRAGMENTATION errors on SLIP
Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1993 03:44:22 GMT

Reducing the mtu on your end won't help. The problem is that packets
being sent by the remote site with an mtu larger than that supported by
your slip connection. Generally, the remote host is on a lan with an
mtu of maybe 1500. The mtu of the slip connection is probably 296. 
Between your machine and the host you want to connect to is an ip router
that has interfaces on both the lan and the slip networks. Packets
comming from the remote host are too big to be sent intact across the
slip connection and are therefore fragmented. Ping packets are small
and don't need to be fragmented. The production Linux systems don't
support re-assembly of the fragmented packets, hence the errors. The
size of the packet depends upon how much data is being sent, so it's
quite conceivable that you could connect to the remote host but die as
it tries to send initial login text.

You can reduce the mtu of the systems on your lan, but that reduces
the effective bandwidth of the lan itself. You could also increase the
mtu of the slip interfaces on both your home machine and the ip router,
but that produces pretty bursty (aka irritating) performance across
slow slip connections. The basic key is that all participants in the
remote<->router<->home machine network need to have the same mtu to prevent
fragmentation, and that's not generally a desirable setup considering
the different bandwidths of your typical lan vs slip connection.

Hello,

I have already figured out the Video Mode table values for my monitor in the
Xconfig file.  However, I do not know what chipset to use for my VGA card.

I have an Ahead V5000 16-bit Video Card. Does anyone know if XFree supports
this card? And if so, what chipset should I specify in the Xconfig.

I should add that a sticker labelled "AVGA" appears on a chip on the card.
Please any help would be appreciated.  I thank you.

Date: Wed, 10 Nov 1993 06:24:01 GMT


Hi,

I was wondering if someone has had the same problems I had getting
solitaire to run under Wine.  It starts out promising, by drawing all of
the cards (very slowly.)  Then it does what appears to be a refresh, and
re-draws all the cards.  Then it dies with the USER.71 error.  I was
hoping to at least be able the run the one program that supposedly can :-)

I noticed that there are a whole lot of USER.* functions, and a few
KERNEL.* functions missing.  Is there some way to attract more
volunteers to help get them completed?  I would be happy to do my part
if I knew who to contact and where to begin.  I have version 0.47 I think.
If Wine could ever reach the point of being able to run serious Windows
programs, I could just about ditch my DOS/WINDOZE partition entirely!!
My soul would be filled with joy on such an occasion :-)

Wine is going to be great if it ever gets finished. . .

My hypothesis as to why 256k is such a good thing for 16 bit apps is that
there are 4 segments * 64k/segment=256k.

FYI, V.42 LAPM and MNP levels 3 and 4 use a synchronous linkup
between the modems, meaning there are no start and stop bits so 
you only need 8 data bits per character.

Before protocol overhead, without compression raw data rate at
14.4kbps is 1800cps, 1700 isn't unreasonable after overhead.

About 1600cps with tupload from the remote end to my end with
my old escapes, a configuration changed some place and I started
escaping 0-31 and 128-159 (the Annex box likes to think of 
control codes with the high bit set as control codes) and am
down to 1450cps.

>If so, what did you tweak? 

Baudrate = 18000, escaping only 13,17,19 and 17,19 with the 
high bit set in the fast direction.

I seem to have a problem running tcsh as login shell. I am running
pl13, and probably have got a fairly recent version of tcsh ( I have
installed Slackware 1.0.5 not so long ago).
My problem is with emacs. It complains whenever I have tcsh running as
login shell that it 'cannot load file /term/lk201'. I am however not
certain what is causing this. It might be that I have a strange
/etc/csh.cshrc file, allthough I did not change it that much.

I posted this problem among other things to comp.os.linux.help, and
got a reply from someone (by email) indicating that tcsh might be the problem.
This person (I somewhat foolishly chopped of the header, so I don't
know his name) seemed to have the same problem, and subsequently
changed his login shell back to bash. 

I do not seem to have any of your other problems with tcsh, allthough
I haven't run it for long enough to be certain.
