Subject: Linux, X-Free-86-1.3, and #9 GXE VL Video card ?
Date: 25 Oct 1993 15:21:21 -0500

Here at Comco we are about to rent a PC, probably from Dell to run
some modeling program.  Being the PC guru here, the job of finding one
has been given to me.

I'd like to be able to run Linux on this machine as well, since we are
a Unix shop, and people won't take it as a serious competitor with our
other Unix machines if it's not able to run X-windows.

I'm thinking of renting a machine from Dell ... specifically, their
'Dell Dimension XPS 466V' - a 486/66DX2, 16 megs RAM ...

What I'm particularly concerned with is their "#9 GXE VL video card
with 1 MB video RAM" - does this work with XFree ?  What chipset is it
anyways ?

Anybody run Linux on one of these machines?  Anything I should know
about before I get it?  Thanks ...

RE:
  SLS is still perceived as the "flagship" Linux distribution by many, probably

Not so. SLS is perceived as the flagship because all information in
the FAQ point the newbie to installing SLS. 

I am new to linux (2 mos), but an old unix hacker. When I got a
laptop specifically to run linux, I read the FAQ before downloading
anything else. EVERYTHING in the FAQ told be to get SLS. So, I got
SLS.

BTW, overall SLS has been fine for me. I've rebuilt the kernel a
couple of times (reduced configurations), and downloaded some updated
utils, but overall, it has worked aok.

To be fair, if I did it over again, I would do it from MCC, but only
because I want to build an environment where I know exactly what
utilites are installed, why and where.

I began using X with a Ati graphics ultra card with the svga server using
the Ati VGA part (this was on a 486/33 with 8 MB). This had a slow sreen
output. When I exchanged the svga server into the the x8514scale server,
which uses the accelerated 8514a part of the Ati card, my display became
very fast. I do now have a second computer with linux. A 386DX-33 with
8 MB RAM and a ET4000 card. This seems to have a much faster screen than
my original setup with Ati VGA and the svga server.

It's an S3 928 chipset. Works with XFree86-2.0, which is available in a

The version of xdvi that came with the SLS used to have buttons, but since I
defected to the MCC distribution, I wouldn't know now.  I have tried to find
xdvi sources for the version with buttons, but have so far been unsuccessful...
anyone know where they are?

Sorry if this is not appropriate here, but if so, just ignore it.

I was wondering if anyone has successfully installed Linux (SLS, or whatever)
on an IBM PS/2 700 notebook. I am mainly interested in the basic install
plus gcc and latex stuff, but if X windows works fine, I would consider
adding the RAM that I would need to do it.

If you have done this, or heard of it done, please let me know by e-mail,
as I will be unable to read news for the next week.

Also, any pitfall warnings in advance are greatly appreciated.

Any problems with the power management, and possible workarounds, are also
appreciated.


Thanks in advance,

Hello,

Just as the subject says I'm looking for a consultant
here in Berkeley.  

I'm willing to pay whatever is fair.  I have several
hundred dollars (at least) to throw at this.

I just don't have the time to learn
enough to get everything set up that I need.  I've got
the new yggdrasil stuff installed and working--sort of,
but I want more--In particular SLIP/PPP or whatever.
I also would like to take better advantage of my ATI
Ultra pro and NEC 6fg monitor.  Basically if  I could get 
my system to the point where I could use it for my everyday
work I could invest the time to learn the ins and outs of
Linux a little more slowly.  


Please reply by E-mail or telephone as I don't read any of
the Linux news groups except .announce regularly.

Thanks.

the standard xdvi includes the buttons unless one uses -Dexpert
 as the buttons take up space better used for text, i always define
them out. there are nice keyboard shortcuts, some of which 
are (see man page for more info):
    d: down
    u: up
    n: next page
    p: previous page
   s3: 1/3 scale (ie 100dpi

I see this operating system and its developers having more of an
Objectivist slant rather than socialist.  It's capitalism at its best...
one with the only motive to be the best a person can be.  Profit is not
important if a person can produce a wonderful piece of code.  When I
think of the work that has gone on to produce Linux, I think of the
first time I read _The_Fountainhead_, and feel the same sort of freedom
of the spirit.

Flames are welcome by all the anti Ayn Rand people out there.

 I agree on this point.  The ideals of GPL, and those that Linux has
taken on touch the souls of most people.

I agree YEA!!  Even though I have spent many frustrating hours working
on my system trying to make it do the things I want it to, I have never
learned so much, and had so much fun.

And how long is your system typically up between reboots? Then
number of shared pages tend to decrease when time passes. For
example I must restart my X session at least once a week due to
memory leaks in XFree86-1.3 server (it's the one distributed by
XFree people, not any S3 server). 

I have 16MB RAM and tho 16MB swap partitions and for example when
I compiled clisp and maxima, memory usage in my box was about
38MB! My system has now been up for about 32 hours.Here is a

Someone listed possible "agendas" of different Linux supporters.
Here is mine.

Linux is a great opportunity for "doing Unix right".  I hope to see
Linux grow to embody the functionality of current Unix systems, but be
more efficient, use less memory, be faster, and friendlier.  Where the
commercial vendors don't have incentive and/or opportunity to spend time
re-writing the OS, many developers are constantly tuning and improving
Linux (eg., file systems, networking, device drivers, utilities, etc).
Linux is well on its way to providing more bang per CPU mips than
most other systems.

I would like to see binary compatibility with DOS, Windows, and other
Unixes (BSD, SVR3, etc.) -- mostly for my own convenience.  If I could
use all the my programs and utilities from one environment, I would never
leave Linux.  But I would also like to see new, neat ideas implemented
and standardized upon (like the /proc filesystem, or a possible
/dev/bitblit interface); I'd really like some of the concepts of Plan9
show up eventually.

Linux is more than an OS, it's a movement -- a chance to contribute to
and modify a system under development, and have those changes be made
part of the standard.  Everyone with a suggestion is welcome, and
programming talent is never turned away :-).

And an extra Thank You to those who've pioneered this effort!

One other thing you might look at.  The xterm program has a resource
that you can set for smooth or jump scrolling.  Smooth scrolling is
*much* slower.  To check, use the ctrl-MB2 to pull up the VT options
menu, and see if there is a check mark next to 'Enable Jump Scroll'.
If there is not, enable it and watch it fly (well, as much as xterm
can fly :-)
        I don't remember the resource off the top of my head, but you
should be able to set it in your .Xdefaults file.

Idea - try turning on jump scrolling, it should make thins a little bit
better for you.

Well, most commercial vendors that are serious about their products make sure
that their products run at least a little faster than their competitors. I 
can't speak for them, cause I'm not them, so any additional speed is them 
being generous ;) My point being, they DO have incentive....

Hmm. this is the point I mostly wanted to comment on. As much as I would like
to see "wing commander" being run in linux, I seriously doubt it would happen
for a variety of reasons. In other words... as much as I hate it, I'm not 
throwing away dos yet.

As for the compatibility-with-everything question, it's been worked on for
quite a while by quite a number of people for quite a few machines. Emulation
of other processes, software, etc is a common project... But having one OS 
supporting "all" OSes in all ways is a bit much. If it happens, I'll be happy
and impressed ;) (get to work, slave programmers! *WHIP* *WHIP*)

Amen. Good place for them CS students to show off what they've learned ;) This
is one of the most important facets of free unixes... anyone can have one, 
anyone can learn to use it, and anyone can contribute when they have got
something usable.

>And an extra Thank You to those who've pioneered this effort!

You've got a lot of people on that list.... And a lot more to be put on it.
