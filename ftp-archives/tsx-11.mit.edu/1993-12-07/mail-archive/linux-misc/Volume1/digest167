I wrote something like this for SCO a while back.  It was truely
trivial, about 30 lines of C.

Basically you open the modem port, set the line to raw mode, set stdin,
and stdout to raw mode, fork, with one process echoing stdin to the
modem, and the other echoing modem input to stdout.

Just set it as your login shell:

main() {
        int fdin,fdout
        int     cc;
        struct termio ios, ios2;

        ioctl(0, TCGETA, ios)
        ...
        ios.c_cc[VMIN]=1;
        ios.c_cc[VTIME]=0;
        ...
        ioctl(0, TCSETAF, ios);

        fdin = open("/dev/modem",O_RDONLY);
        ioctl(fdin, TCGETA, ios2)
        ...
        ios2.c_cc[VMIN]=1;
        ios2.c_cc[VTIME]=0;
        ...
        ioctl(fdin, TCSETAF, ios2);

        fdout = open("/dev/modem",O_WRONLY);
        if(fork()) {
                for(;;){
                        read(fdin, &cc, 1);
                        write(1, &cc, 1);
                }
        } else {
                for(;;) {
                        read(0, &cc, 1);
                        write(fdout, &cc, 1);
                }
        }
}

Rough but you get the idea

Has anyone tried porting Espresso to Linux?  I just got the source,
and it looks like more work than what I had anticipated.  If I do
get it working, is anybody interested in either the binaries, or
a patch kit for the source?  Any response would be appreciated.

If "Espresso" is a two-level logic minimization tool from UC Berkeley,
then there should be no problem. I use it (almost) every day on a
Linux box. It compiled with 0.10/1.39 and still does with .99pl11/2.3.3.
Where is your problem?

If it is another "Espresso" then of course I have no idea.

Thanks to all those who replied. I am now using tn3270 and it pretty
much does the job (although there are a few minor problems with
characters getting left on supposedly blanked lines). If I had the
memory in my office machine doubtless I'd run X and thus x3270, but
'tis not to be...

Thanks again.

Well, I decided to write a "Intelligent Board Driver" For Linux 4 days ago,
today As of today the board configuration and initilization works , as well
as input and output. No DCD/DTR ioctl calls are supported yet, but they will 
be. I'm expecting to release source to the drivers as "alpha" withen 2 weeks.
These are initially going to support "Digboard PC/8i, PC/16i, PC/8e,PC/16e,
PC/8m, PC/16m" but soon after "Star Gate ACL" will be supported, as well
as Digiboard COM/xx products. Others are on the list. 

 I was online on IRC for 2 hours with the Driver, and it seemed to hold up
 to the "non-demanding" but "constant" character stream rather well. It's
 coming along nicely, and the package I'm writing is designed to allow
 easy addition of different types of serial boards, and have it all be 
 dynamically allocated (from the minor numbers) at run time.

Subject: writing X apps in C++? You need OI !!

I just downloaded the OI package and I have to say I'm very pleased. It's the
FULL WORKS of the commercial tool that I paid $$$ for on my SUN. Not
crippleware in any way!! It's even one version ahead of the one I pay for :-(

If you're into writing applications for X (OpenLook or Motif) and you use C++
I can strongly recommend you get this package and look at it carefully.

It may not be to everybody's taste - you wont see Xt... anything for example
as it replaces everything except xlib. But it surely is a fast way to make
x-apps!!

With enthusiasm, Nigel

PS:: I have no relation with parcPlace except being (obviously I suppose) a
pleased user of their product on my SUN system.

PPS: How's about trying to put something useful in the OI/contrib section ??

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Subject: Counting Linux users: an attempt
Date: 29 Sep 1993 10:23:43 GMT

Hello,

there have been many attempts at defining the size of the Linux
user base. None of them contained hard data.

Now, in an attempt to establish a lower limit on the number of
Linux users, I have put up a MAIL SERVER that does counting.

So, if you are a Linux user, and want to be counted, send an E-mail
to the address

    linux-counter@uninett.no

with the subject being one of

    I use Linux at home
    I use Linux at work
    I use Linux at home and at work
    I do not use Linux

The scanner looks for the words "home", "work" and "not" to determine
where you use Linux, and sends you back an ACK that includes the current
state of the count.

The whole subject line is kept, along with your FROM address; if you
want to change your opinion, just send another mail to linux-counter.

The current count (after announcing it in Norway for 1 day) is:

Total 19 users

PROBABLE DISTRIBUTION OF PLACES WHERE LINUX IS USED
  12 at home
   4 somewhere
   1 at home and at work
   1 at work
   1 not used

DISCUSSION:

I know that any counting mechanism is biased. And given what Linux is,
no mechanism will get registrations from those who don't want to be counted.
There are also a number of ways to confuse the issue, such as:

- Mass registrations from bogus accounts (aka Usenet "votes")
- Junk registrations of "I don't care what Linux is" and such things
- Trying to estimate the number of non-"voting" persons

But after a week or five of this, I will have a number, and we can start
debating whether that number is interesting or not.

(Fair question: Why not post to comp.os.linux.announce? Because I don't
want that much mail at first - make sure everything works shipshape
before I dump it onto the whole world!)

Have fun voting!

I'm not that surprised.  First, because Linux users generally wouldn't
be going to Unix Expo and second because most Linux users just don't
expect that sort of support to be available -- yet.

Connecting commercial vendors with the Linux community is going to
take some work.  For example, I have spoken at the local (Seattle)
Unix Group meeting on Linux.  An overflow crowd (about 75) with a
followup meeting for questions and answers attended by around 30 --
all of whom are either running Linux or plan to run it.

I am also attempting to get a magazine, Linux Journal going.  (For
those who heard about it before it almost died but it looks like I
will be teaming up with a publisher of another UNIX-related
publication and it is going to happen.)  Much like small local
newspapers and small town local radio stations, the audience will have
a specific interest.  Advertising in such media can be a service to
the reader rather than just a way to pay for the publication.

Linux is very young.  It reminds me of the UNIX community of over 10
years ago.  Users are hungry for information and products but they
don't really know where to look.  I feel that marketing effort today
will pay off big in the long run.

if you're using loopback, it could be that you have an address

a grep loopback rc.*. i have my rc.inet[12] files in /etc/rc.d)

I have not seen timed in any Linux directories, has it ported to Linux?

I tried to find a source, but that was not so easy, all I found was
something quite old BSD thing. It did not compile "out-of-box",
but perhaps with little work.

By the way is there any kind of porting howto? It would be nice
to collect some hints what to do if I get something like sgtty.h is
missing or something. (I got that meggage when I tried to compile a
commercial Forth).
