Reply-To: mmclagan@invlogic.com

Hi,

   I've got a new situation here, and I'm wondering if linux will let me do
this, or should I seek another solution.

   We've got an ethernet set up with Netware 3.12 running on it, with it's
TCP/IP stuff loaded (may not be necessary or wanted), and various files
on it.  We're connected with 3C509s.  I have our mail server running UUPC on 
a 386-20 with 8 Megs of ram and a couple of MFM drives.  The machine is 
something like 5 years old, and uses DRAMs, so I can't expand it at all.
It won't support other drives either! 

   Basically we've got a potential of going to a full-time connection via a 
SLIP/CSLIP line to a provider in the area.  What I'm thinking is that I would
put linux on the old mail server, and have it act as DNS and router for our
domain, as well as being the one connected to the SLIP modem and our provider.

   The question is how difficult would this be to do, and what would I need
to do to get it up and running?  Could it act as NNTP server, and possibly
feed UUCP connections from it as well?  Does linux have support for the 3com
card I have?  And on a side note, can I use the TCP/IP on the Netware server
for any good benefit, or should I just take it down?

   Mike was here...

Speaking as one who also hase used both, and is still looking for a good
comm program, I'd say that minicom beats the pants off of pcomm.  It's nicer
to use, and nicer to customize.  It also works in Xwindows, which Pcomm does
not, at least doesn't at pl10...

Fix your mailer.  "scosysv" is not a valid system name for Internet mail, or
for much of anything else, either (since it looks suspiciously like a default
name probably shared by umpteen hundred other systems --- so who gets your

There exists at present only one PPP implementation, and it's guaranteed to
NOT do what you want --- I am mentioning it only in case someone else brings
it up (which has happened before).  My port of JNOS 1.09 to Linux supports PPP
mainly because the code needed no porting from the DOS version, but it also
*behaves* like the DOS version:  you have to do everything from inside JNOS,
it's not integrated with Linux TCP/IP.  And for this purpose it's not worth
changing, since I keep hearing rumors of kernel PPP in development (almost
certainly not even in alpha-test state yet).

Date: Tue, 16 Nov 1993 05:19:18 GMT

        Hi, I just received my BusLogic BT-747S.  So far, I have only
gotten it to work under the AHA-1542 driver in the kernel, and it
doesn't seem to work when I have only AHA-1740 support compiled in.  As
far as I know, the driver for 1542 probably isn't taking full advantage
of the EISA speed (10-33 Mbits/sec!!!), so is there a possibility to
hack the existing driver for one that takes full advantage of BusLogic
card?

thanks,
Bruce

   The only way people are going to join such a team, however, is if
   there is a structure and attitude to permit mutual benefit.  The FSF project
   provided an essential part of the Linux structure by writing the GPL.  What
   they haven't promoted, at least in the case of Hurd, is an attitude that
   encourages people to work together.  That requires letting the people that
   write prototype code make design decisions, and providing enough interim
   releases that testers see the positive influence of their feedback.

There are essentially two reasons for this.  First, in order to keep
the design coherent, it is necessary to have a relatively small number
of people architect the system.  Second, until there is a nearly
self-hosting system, people need Mach 3.0 systems, which are
relatively few and far between.  

The goals for Linux to solve were clear in advance: implement the
features of a BSD kernel.  But with the Hurd, I wanted to be more open
ended about what features to provide; this meant that they were *new*
things.  Not just "how do we implement feature XXX", but also "should
we do XXX or YYY."

Originally, I had a mailing list, called hurd-folks, in which such
design questions were to be discussed.  It failed, because the
participants tended to harp on about favorite littly petty issues like
whether a.out should be the default exec format, or settled issues
like whether we should really be using Mach or not.

So, we tried that system, and it failed.

   Why isn't it spelled "Herd"? So it can be trademarked, or because you
   wanted a letter in common with GNU, or some other reason?

Because I'm perverse and wanted to spell it differently from the
normal word.  It suggests that there should be an acronym.

But there isn't an acronym, at least, not one thought of in advance.
However, several people have thought up clever possibilities.  Here
are some of the current ones:

Has Unix Really Died?

Hurd Unacceptably Repeats Disasters.

Hierarchy of Useful Recursive Daemons.

Some are mutually indirectly recursive acronyms:

HURD == Hird of Unix-Replacing Daemons
HIRD == Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth

HURD == Host of Unix-Replacing Daemons
HOST == Handful of Server Things
THINGS == That's Hurd IN Gnu Speak

The first is my favorite.  The second indicates the possiblity of
abusive ones as well as positive.  The third is really totally false,
because the Hurd is neither hierarchical nor recursive.

The Hurd is also namef for neithr British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd nor plainsong researcher/composer David Hurd.

I thought of the idea of mutually indirectly recursive acronyms; I
think it's original.  If anyone thinks up other clever acronyms or
knows of other real-life people named `Hurd', let me know.  A list of
such will be in the manual when it gets published.

The nearest equivalent under X is the ICCCM (Inter-Client something),

I am about to buy a new system.  It has a Diamond Viper VLB card in it.  
After reading some FAQ'S from the Linux and XFree86 groups, I am wondering if 
anyone out there is using or has written drivers that support this card.  The
XFree86-2.0 FAQ states:

     "The Diamond SpeedStar 24 (and possibly recent SpeedStar+) boards are
      NOT supported, even though they use the ET4000. The same is valid
      for all of Diamond's S3 boards. The reason for this is that
      Diamond has changed the mechanism used to select pixel clock
      frequencies, and will only release programming information under
      non-disclosure.  We are not willing to do this (as it would mean
      that source cannot be provided).  We have had discussions with
      Diamond over this, and they do not intend to change this policy.
      Hence we will do nothing to support Diamond products going forward
      (i.e. don't send us a program to run to set their clocks).  XFree86
      DOES NOT SUPPORT DIAMOND HARDWARE.  It is possible to make some
      of it work, but we will not assist in doing this."  

This suggests that someone may have built the drivers needed.  I would
appreciate any feedback on this subject.

Thanks in advance,
