Which model? I use a Toshiba MX-4101b with NO problems what so ever!
A friend has tried a Sony and had one crash bad enough to put him off the idea
for good (He lost the contents of a 450 MB SCSI)

So it seems that the problem is neither H/W nor S/W but back to good old
machine configuration (His ISA bus was set to run at 16.8 MHz, the cards got
upset and told him so, in no uncertain terms....)

Me again.  I just managed to fathom enough of the web2c and all that to 
create gftopk with a larger max_rows.  I now can use MetaFont to place pictures
of essentially ANY size into ANY TeX document.  YOu generate the pictures 
using either Xfig and fig2MF, or gnuplot with the mf terminal setting.

Then, Metafont can create the ``fonts'' with your drawing or graph, and you 
run gftopk to get a pk font, and dvips/xdvi shows you what you get.

I have packaged up the gftopk.c with the new maxrows, along with just enough
of the TeX distribution to compile it.  It should be widely portable.

For the life of me I can't find any licensing/copyright information on the 
stuff I have.  Does anyone know?  One file, configure, was covered by the GPL,
but the rest has no copyright information.

If anyone knows whether I can distribute this, let me know and I will.  This
is the one obstacle to fully enabling the use of fig2MF, so I think it'd be 
useful.

Date: 4 Dec 1993 04:15:48 -0000


First of all my apologies for the delay in posting this summary, I've been
a bit busy of late.  Secondly my thanks to the many people that replied.

OK, where do I start...

My original post was about setting up a Linux machine as a *nix server for
about 40 final year Computer Science students, not as a machine for any sort
of serious development work, but as a testbed where they could play around
with a real *nix system in a safe environment.

Rather than try to cover the many and varied replies I got I'll give the
overall conclusions I reached.

I had responses from people using Linux boxes as mail/news servers, personal
workstations, and people running labs full of Linux boxes!  Most people
found Linux stable and reliable.  I had several responses from people who
thought the idea of having the students run the system themselves was a good
one, as it gives them a chance to pick up some very useful practical
experience.

The hardware side was straightforward enough - you can never have to much RAM,
especially if X is to be used, or there'll be a fair bit of compiling going
on.  A 486DX2/66 with upwards of 16MB of RAM should be able to handle 10-12
'well-behaved' users concurrently.

Linux was recommended as the OS to use by everybody bar one - this is not
exactly surprising seeing as I only posted to the c.o.l hierarchy ;-)
The reasons put forward for Linux were generally:

        - Its free

        - You get the complete kernel source

        - It works

        - It sometimes doesn't work ;-)
          (as in it will occasionally crash, giving the students a chance
          to loose some sleep trying to get things fixed)

        - Its resilient - if something goes seriously wrong you can
          (hopefully!) re-install everything from scratch and have a 
          working system back in a matter of hours

        - It makes better use of the hardware than other *nixes

        - Its a complete *nix system

        - It gives you a *nix workstation for half the price of a typical
          *nix box

        - There's enough rough edges to keep people challenged / busy
          improving things


The reasons against Linux were:

        - Networking still needs some work (though it _is_ getting there!)

        - Lack of Documentation

        - Not uniform enough to provide a good teaching system.


Now for the results!  I submitted a proposal to the CS dept looking for a
machine to set up.  However at this stage things don't look promising, for
two reasons:

        - its a 'distraction' for the students (fair enough, its almost
          half way through the academic year, we've got plenty of other
          things to do)

        - there's a horrendous amount of politicking involved between the
          CS dept (the good guys) and computing services (the bad guys),
          who don't like the idea of a machine they don't control on the
          campus net.  (<soapbox on> Not that it'd make much of a 
          difference, they hardly seem to be able to manage the machines
          they already control ;-) <soapbox off>)

However!  In the longer term, say for the next academic year, there is the
possibility that something could be set up next summer, so all is not lost...


Thanks again to everybody who replied.

Hi !

I am using a 1.2 gig hard drive with an adaptec 1542C card. The 1542C controller
works fine with dos, but doesn't work with linux (disk a1.5). 

If the Adaptec BIOS is enabled, linux reports during bootup :
 aha1542_out failed(1): Configuring Adaptec at IO:330, IRQ 11, DMA priority 5
 aha1542_out failed(1): aha1542.c: interrupt received, but no mail
 aha1542.c: interrupt received, but no mail
 scsi0: Adaptec 1542
 aha1542.c: interrupt received, but no mail
and the system hangs.

If the Adaptec BIOS is disabled, linux boots up but doesn't use the hard drive
translation to 255 heads, 63 sectors performed by the Adaptec BIOS at bootup
time.

Is there a patch for linux that automatically remaps big SCSI devices
(>1024 Cylinders) to 255 heads and 63 sectors ???

If the Adaptec BIOS is necessary for the developers, I could send a memory dump
of it.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

The "100% microsoft compatible" 3 button mice seems to use a 
"cheating" protocol in the way that whenever you press 
the middle button, it looks to the application reading
the mouse that you pressed the left and right button at 
the same time. Just use the "Microsoft" keyword and
"Emulate3Button". 

It works, but I would prefer finding out what kind of 
"garbage" I have to send to the mouse
to put it in its native mode. (It's a mouseman). 

Maybe this should be a faq ?

Well, pl13t survived just over 7 days before it succumbed to the

Subject: Help with ethernet network
Date: 2 Dec 93 01:06:25 GMT

I am having trouble getting Linux to use the ethernet card installed in 
my Zenith 486.  The card is an Elite16 set to IRQ 5.  I am running the SLS 
distribution of Linux with the distributed kernel (patch level 12, I think).
When Linux boots it recognizes the card, returns the correct ethernet address
and IRQ (5), but when /etc/rc.net is run, Linux says the network is
unreachable.  As far as I can tell, everything is correct in /etc/hosts
and ifconfig reports correct settings.  I seems like Linux can't even see 
the card.

Can anyone who has Linux networked through an ethernet card drop me
some Email and give me a hand?  I have run out of places to look.

Thanks in advance,
Erik

Hi,

I am looking to purchase a tape backup system. It has better to be external
because my computer doesn't have any space for internal drives. Also
It must be compatible with both dos and unix systems (i.e Linux that I have)
Also it has rather to be cheap (I hate ripoff prices because I know today
it is not big deal to manufacture a tape backup) but reliable and fast!
Any Opinions are Important...Also I will really appreciate if someone

Ah, the infamous Pin 31 problem! This line must be set HIGH or
