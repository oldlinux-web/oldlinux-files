Get a copy of the uutraffic program listed in Unix World, Aug 93. This
displays the contents of the xferstats file in a more readable manner.

For me it say's I average 1496 bps for downloading 5 Mb of (C)news batches
using the g protocol (extended packages size) to a Waffle site (using 1.65).
I have a v32.bis linkup running at 57600 Baud line speed, using v42.bis 
compression (although this doesn't have much effect on enws batches).

You can get this package at ftp.uu.net:/publications/unix-world/grabbag/1993.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix.
The FAQ for this group is available on rtfm.mit.edu in

I agree too.

Rather than have all this MCC is better than Slackware and SLS is
worse than MCC and ....

Why not have the various releases set up to suit applications people
are interested in running initially.

SLS is great for people who want to do "efg" with linux
Slackware is great for people who want to do "xyz" with linux
MCC is great for people that do "abc" with linux

Personally I've been using SLS 1.02 on a couple of different machines
and it suits me perfectly. I run UUCP, MAIl & NEWS all without a
hiccup. I can grab my news feeds and mail when it suits. I use a fast
14.4 modem. I transfer my data at 1440 cps.  Why would I bother to
bash *any* system when this one suits me?

It's the latest, greatest version of the one that started the Linux
distribution wars, the one that's "... taking completely the wrong
approach ..." ;^)

A few features:
 -- Kernel at .99pl12 (August 13, 1993 version)
 -- All new improved installation and package maintenence scripts.
 -- Jove editor
 -- Emacs 19.19
 -- GNU chess and xboard
 -- Every FAQ related to Linux that you could possibly ask for.
 -- and, much, much, more. I'll make a more descriptive announcement in
    in the very near future. 

Here's MHO on the "OS wars":

This isn't like NT vs. OS/2 or something. 

If you'd rather get MCC and put together the extras yourself, good 
for you. MCC is a great base package, and you'll probably learn a 
thing or two setting up the software yourself. 

I don't see why there can't be several Linux distributions floating 
around, unless they happen to be totally bug-ridden or something. 
This one is targeted at people who want to be able to install a full-
featured system without having to chase down all the software, or 
spend 3 days debugging after the installation.

It's in /pub/linux/slackware on ftp.cdrom.com.

Have fun!

   >Or Visual Basic -- who needs that?

   Basically people like me, who have to get the WORK done, rather than trying to
   navigate/remember the 2000 pages manual!

There are *many* other ways to get work done other than using MS-Windows and 
Visual Basic...(and you don't even have to navigate/remember the 2000 page manual
either :-)

   I used to do simulations and suchlike on a CDC Cyber machine, because that was
   the only usable system at the time. What a load of Cr*p. The graphical output
   was a line printer character dump, and *I* had to write a utility to convert
   the printout into a HPGL files for the plotter using (yueergh) Fortran and Pas-
   cal in a happy mixture because the graphichs library was written in Fortran!

Hmmm...that seems like the level of technology at about the time the PC was introduced
seems IBM had quite a big hand in the introduction of the PC, and Microsoft provided
the O/S (which hasn't changed significantly since then...)

   What Microsoft did to the world was to create a market for graphical applicati
   ons, that most people can use without being an computer expert or spending
   90% of the time on the computer to get the plot right. 

Hmmm...seems like selective memory to me...Microsoft didn't do jack until it was
*forced* to play catch-up to Apple's Mac GUI. And even Apple took some of their
GUI from other companies/projects...I guess Microsoft "created a market" by following
someone else's lead??? (anything like "leading from behind" ?). Also if I remember
correctly MIT was working on the X system (or precursors to it) prior to Windows
coming out...

   I think that is a very great achievement!!

Nope, just good marketing...

   >Need I say any more?

   Sure, if you can. 

   Look,  DOS can't run by itself, either. It too needs a bootstrap loader.

Ummm difference between "booting" and "running"...

   Using an inferior OS as part of the bootstrapping sequence is  
   common practice nowadays. My SGI Indigo has a tiny OS in ROM which
   has more functionality than DOS has - it even can do some networking,
   and, of course, it can load and run programs. Usually, it's only used
   for firing up the IRIX kernal and for maintenance purposes.  IÄ'm told

Okay, now the question is, once loaded, does the IRIX kernel use the
ROM bootstrap program, or does it communicate with the hardware directly?
i.e. does the IRIX kernel *replace* the functionality of the ROM bootstrap
loader when its running, or does it *extend* or *complement* the functionality
of the bootstrap loader. If it *replaces the functionality of the bootstrap
loader, then the IRIX kernel is said to "run by itself", otherwise, its
an extension to the bootstrap loader...Windows is an extension to DOS, it
does not "run by itself"...

   Does this make IRIX, SunOS, DOS or NT not an operating system, just
   because none can run "by itself", and needs something as a loader
   (and perhaps as an interface provider) which meets most of the
   criteria for an OS and *does* run "by itself"?  Of course not!

   If it makes you feel better to call Windows not an OS, just because
   it has a three-step boot sequence (i.e. BIOS -> Boot record -> DOS -> 
   Windows) instead of the more common two-step one (i.e. BIOS-> Boot 
   record -> [NT/OS2/what have you]), feel free to do so. 

Ummm...its not because of the 3 step boot sequence...the distinction
is NOT the number of steps, but instead a replacement/extension of
functionality...Windows NT and OS/2 completely *replace* the functionality
of DOS in that they do not use DOS to talk to the "machine" in any way, 
shape, or form. By the same token Windows 3.x *extends* the functionality
of DOS by providing additional features, but still relying on DOS
to provide many of its functions. When you start Windows 3.x, DOS is
still running underneath to provide some of the services...When running
OS/2 or Windows NT, DOS is considered an "application" running under the
control of the base O/S (which provides considerable control over
the DOS environment). When running Windows 3.x, DOS *is* the base O/S
with Windows running as a protected mode application...


   I prefer the more traditional view that an operating system is a
   hierarchically constructed or layered set of interacting programs 
   which together manage the basic resources: time, memory, storage, I/O.

[...stuff deleted...]

   The primary view we take in this book is that the operating system
   is a collection of programs (algorithms) designed to manage the system's
   resources, namely, memory, processors, devices, and information (program
   and data). [...]"

Okay, as you say, an operating system is a collection of programs designed to
manage the systems resources...DOS uses 3 primary programs/files, IO.SYS,
MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM plus a bunch of utility programs to manage the 
systems resources. So lets consider the 3 primary files + utilities as
"The DOS Operating System". Windows provides many utilities of its own
plus a nice GUI, but it still makes use of IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM
to provide many of its services. Looking at it from this point, DOS *is* an
operating system. DOS + Windows *is* an operating system. Windows by itself
is *not* an operating system

In November of '83 I bought a copy of MS Word that was a big deal
because it had a very limited WYSIWYG capability and it was mouse
enabled.  Characterizing MS as reacting to Apple seems a bit
selective to me.

Of course at the same time I also had a Perq Systems 1 workstation
with a nice gui display and a puck-and-pad pointer.  So maybe
Apple and MS were just reacting to Perq.

I don't think a compressed file system would be all that difficult. Random
access can be handled by compressing the file in blocks, and perhaps storing
an offset to each block at the beginning of the file or in its own disk block.
that way, decompression can be done block by block, still leaving good random
access performance and also the possibility for demand paging executables and
shared libraries. You lose some compression, but not all that much. (look at
V.42bis which compresses small blocks of data but still gets ~50% on
uncompressed files) In my opinion, the gzip algorithm would be good since the
decompression is very fast, but compression is slow. The compression speed 
isn't a problem since you can do lazy compression, first writing a file
normally, and then compressing it later. You could also have compression
scheduled to occur once a day, or have it triggered by a percentage of
the disk being used up. that way, performance stays high until the disk gets
full and then gradually degrades. You can have the computer track usage and
compress files using an LRU strategy so that decompression time affects you
as little as possible.

Overall, I would expect some performance loss, but not nearly as much as most
people seem to think. On a 386sx or a slower dx, it may very well have a
significant performance hit. I considered adding some of this to Linux myself, 
but I have very little time available and I heard that there were people 
working on it already. I would certainly be willing to try it when it becomes 
available for testing, and until then, I don't see much point in arguing about 
how fast it will or won't be, or how complex it make the kernel, or how hard 
it would be to recover from a damaged file system.
