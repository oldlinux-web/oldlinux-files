Firstly the name: according to my dictionary a "consortium" is a
combination of countries, companies, or other groups acting together. I
don't think that the proposed Linux Consortium fits this definition.
Perhaps "Linux Distributions Review Group" would be better.

Is there a need for such a group? Just look at the complaints and cries
for help in the newsgroups. CD-ROM distributions are being sent out
with boot disks that just do not work. Unless you have access to the
Internet no amount of experience will help. In my case it takes nearly
two hours of a long-distance phone call to ftp a floppy disk worth of
code. Linux will get a bad name if distributors are allowed to
advertise what they cannot deliver. Until you have a working system
it not possible to get a documentation on the floppy disks or CD.

I would like to suggest that the review group should:

   a) Collect reports from anybody who wishes to report a problem.
   b) Attempt to verify the problem reports where possible.
   c) Maintain a database of solutions.
   d) Issue guidance to distributors.

In short, the aim would be to help people with problems and to help
distributors improve their products.

    This is known as interleaved swap and Linux doesn't do it... you might
    as well put it all in one swap partition.

Does anyone have any info on a X server for the AIR 2000VL video card?
The AIR 2000VL is a Weitek P9000 based card that beat the Diamond Viper
recently.  
I'm curious if the card will work with the Viper alpha server, or if
there are plans to support it with its own server?

I don't know what BogoMip is, but every benchmark I have run on the
P5-60 substantially beats or at least matches the fastest 486/66v I can
find. These have been mainly scientific and academic-type benchmarks
like nsieve, FLOPS, linpack, heapsort, dhrystone, etc. My latest
c-linpack runs give 9.5 MFLOPS (double precision) for the P5-60, and 1.5
MFLOPS for a 486/33. I no longer have a 486/66 on hand, but past
experience would put it at about 2.8 MFLOPS.

Hi, I just recently purchased a 486 dx/2 66MHz with 8 megs ram(hoping to be able
to afford upgarding to 16 in a year:) ) and a 340 meg HDisk.  Also my display will be
running on a Cirrus Logic Local Bus GD5426 Accelerator.

  I would like to run all my DOS games and Windows programs, yet be able to have Unix(or something similar) on my system.  I've heard that Linux has a DOS emulator...so the question is would it be feasible to put it on in X-Windows with the XFree86?  What sort of partitioning should I do?  What else should I know?

I know this must be a FAQ but could someone(or more) please e-mail me with
solutions, so that I won't have to be stuck with just DOS and Windows on my 
system?:)  Also if Linux is not the answer, please give me other alternatives for my system to run multitasking, 32-bit OS which still allows Windows and DOS programs.

Thanks in advance,

Obcourse this will cause real problems if you ment to have multiple copies
of the same file.  So you might want to edit /tmp/$$ before running awk.

Hmmm..., it looks like tcsh 6.04 is reporting Segmentation faults if I do this
all in a pipe with 0.99pl14.   It looks like I'll have to search for the

        As I understand it, the Linux Consortium is not attempting
to restrict distribution of Linux.  The Linux Consortium is an
attempt to provide some reasonably unbiased information about
installing Linux.  A lot of people who are interested in Linux could
use this information.

SLS installs a lot of things you will never use, for me that is
for instance emacs.
Also you should consider installing TinyX instead of all the libs
programs and utilities that SLS dumps on your disk. 130Mb is not
much to run Linux + X from. I have 170Mb in my laptop and am
running into troubles anyhow.

You need SLS or something similar to get you started when being
a linux novice. After playing around for some months you better
do upgrades and so on yourself. I am still planning to scrape
all the nonused stuff from my filesystem to free more working 
space.
I think that I have to agree partially with the people who
say that this system is growing too big. It should be possible
to get a Linux + X system up and running in 40Mb.

ANY CDROM WHICH YOU BUY FOR LINUX WILL BE OUT OF DATE.

This is a simple fact of life. If you buy a CDROM and expect to get the
"current" code then you are deluding yourself. The reason is that it takes
some finite amount of time to master the CDROM. During that time, the code
for Linux changes.

If you really want current code, then you must obtain it from the ftp
archive sites.

About the only thing that is current for CDROMs -- all of them -- is
SLS. Perhaps that says something about the release status of SLS ??

I wonder if the people who maintain SCSI-HOWTO could add a note saying that
AHA154xC and AHA154xCF is not going to work with disks larger than 1GB.
AHA154xCF is the most recent and (as far as I can tell) one of the most popular
controllers offered these days. One can safely bet that more and more people
will be buying large disks and they may falsely assume that these disks are
going to work with the AHA154xC.

Although it was said that Adaptec would be willing to send replacement ROMs
that were used with the older models of the controller, cf.:

>If someone is interested in fixing the aha1542.c driver, Adaptec at
>(408) 945-8600 will send you a free replacement pair of ROMs (P/N
>528600 Rev D), along with the updated v3.0a software kit "ASPI MS-DOS
>Manager with ASPI Disk Module" (P/N 527800-01 Rev B) - all for no
>charge at all.  Just explain that you want to use greater-than-
>one-gig drives on your 1542.

they refused to do it for me. I called them today and was essentially told
to get lost.

I bought the AHA1542CF assuming that it would be functionally equivalent or
at least compatible with the controller mentioned in SCSI-HOWTO. Well, it is,
but not for disks larger than 1GB. So I am now stuck with a controller and
disk which I can only look at.

I am willing to offer a small award (say two cases of good imported beer) to
the first person who gets from Adaptec (or from elsewhere) the details of the
protocol used by the AHA1542C to unblock the 1GB disk. As soon as these details
are available, I can fix the driver (I have spent a considerable amount of time
staring at it and hoping it would magically fix itself) in a couple of days,
unless Eric Youngdale does it first.

In the meantime, if you would like to trade your old rusty AHA1542 for
a brand new shiny AHA1542CF (at no extra charge), you know whom to call!
