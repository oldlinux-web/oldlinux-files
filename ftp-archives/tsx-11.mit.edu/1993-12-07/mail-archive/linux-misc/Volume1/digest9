I use term1.0.7 a lot (on my sparc 1), and apart from the bugs, I like it
a lot.
REcently, however, I find a need to be able to display X stuff on someone
else's machine. Ideally, I would like to do something like

  "txconn other.machine.display:0"
  
on my end, and be able to treat the other display as display :9 on my
machine.
Is there some way of doing this that I don't know about?

I have tried

tredir 6009 other.machine.name:6000

But it didn't seem to work. I was running txconn on the school end of
things, so that may have interfered. I don't know.

(I'm referring to the fact that even multiple tredir's seem to conflict
with themselves. )

You must *be* in a cave if you haven't heard about INN :-)

Look in news.software.b, news.admin.technical, or news.answers for the
fine FAQs to Cnews and INN so you can get the straight scoop.

>Does it have a GUI newsreader? NNTP? What minimum linux release does it
>require?

First of all, it's a transport agent only.  There are no newsreaders of 
any kind.  Basically think of it as a super-fast Cnews+NNTP package
generally intended to handle multiple nntp newsfeeds (in and out).  It
requires tcp/ip rather heavily and runs via a daemon that stays up all the
time.

If you're happy with Cnews, there's probably no reason to switch but if
you run high volumes through a system and think Cnews is either too slow
or takes too much time, it might be worth a look.

I'd suggest you switch to the Performance Release of Cnews if you're
familiar with Cnews and want a performance release without the trauma
of unlearning most of what you know and switching to INN.

Clearly, it's not for the faint of heart as it's not clearly documented by
any stretch of the imagination.  I found the docs and man pages virtually
unreadable and I've been running Bnews and Cnews for 6 years.  I'm certain
that everything is in there somewhere, it's just not readily findable IMHO.
I suppose the docs are always the last thing that happen.

But that puppy is sure faaaaast !!!

I gave it a try for grins and for a little off-the-job-training that
maybe I can apply at work.  I might add that I'm a uucp-only site so
you don't need to be on Internet to run it or benefit from it.

You can get an 8 port twisted pair hub for about $200.00.  If you
can indeed get twisted pair cards for $30 (vs. $90 - $100 for thinnet)
then the price savings from 3 cards will nearly pay for the hub.  Add
in the lower cable cost and twisted-pair becomes a bargin.

Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 05:38:53 GMT



Ok, I have got the Linux base system going.  It's running GREAT on my
486-66 box.  I have a problem though,  It seems I am unable to install
the "Xwindows" portion.  I got the files from:

host  : tsx-11.mit.edu
dir   : /pub/linux/packages/SLS
files : directories x1,x2,...,x10

I got all the files in tar form.  I used minicom to get the files off of
netcom, and into my linux box.  I put all of them in a directory "/XX11"
Here are the things I've tried:

        - used "sysinstall -instsrc /XX11 -X11
        - used "sysinstall -instsrc /XX11 -extracttar x1.tar (nothing happened)
        - used "sysinstall -disk -instsrc /XX11 -X11"
        - used "sysinstall -X11"
        - used "menu" to install (FAT chance!)

I failed on all accounts.  Either it tried to get the files from my 
floppy drive "put disk x1 in drive, and hit return," or it tried to
read the harddrive, and told me that the "diskx1" was missing, and could not
be found.  

What am I doing wrong?  I looked in the FAQs, and found nothing relevant.
I even tried the "-series x" switch to no avail.  After that I moved ALL
files from their respective x1,x2,...,x10 directories to /XX11 directories.
still no luck.  Can anyone help?


I've sucessfully installed the "a" series, the "b" series, the "c" series,
"d" series, and the "s" series.  The difference there was that those 
series were on floppies, and where installed to my HD, where these already
reside on my linux system,but are not installed yet.  What am I doing wrong?

NEW USERS: WHERE TO GET THE LINUX FAQ (please read)

PLEASE: EVERYONE read the FAQ for this group before posting questions. Many 
people (myself included) worked hard to produce the FAQ to accurately answer 
all of your questions. The new version of the FAQ (with many updates, 
clarifications, etc.) will only come out every month! So you won't see it 
posted that often. In the meantime you'll have to get it in one of the
following ways:

1)  ftp to tsx-11.mit.edu. It's the directory /pub/linux/docs/FAQ. 
    It's split up into 5 files: the table of contents and the four parts of
    the FAQ itself. Each part is about 50K.

or  ftp to sunsite.unc.edu. It's the file /pub/Linux/docs/FAQ. This is one
    big ASCII file containing the entire FAQ (about 200K).

or  ftp to any news.answers archive site. For example, you can find 
    Linux-related postings from news.answers in the directory
    /usenet/comp.os.linux and /usenet/comp.os.linux.announce on ftp.uu.net.

2)  If you don't have FTP access, you can retrieve it via the mailserver at
    rtfm.mit.edu. Send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the word "help" 
    in the body.
or  If you simply can't find the FAQ, I will mail it to you myself. Just
    send me mail (mdw@tc.cornell.edu).

3)  The most recent FAQ will be posted to comp.os.linux, comp.os.linux.announce,
    and news.answers every month (if you want to wait...).

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION: Read the "Meta-FAQ" posted weekly to c.o.l.a (also

        Building emacs 19 basically requires knowing "tar zxvf
emacs-19.18.tar.gz" "./configure" "make" and "make install".  The
main problem is that it requires, transiently, around 40 or 50 megs
of disk.

        As for the SLS v MCC thing, I installed SLS around 4 or 5 months
ago, fixed most of the glaring problems (like world writeable /usr),
removed everythin I didn't want, and upgrading just about everything as
the new versions came out.  SLS is far from ideal, but there's work being
done on developing a better fs layout.

        I've been told that, if you only want two hosts on your network,
can just run a twisted pair cable between the two hubs.  I've not tried it
(never having had the hardware or inclination lying around) but it
sounds reasonable.  Of course, it only works if you've only got TWO hosts
on your network.

That is exactly, what happens when you type ctrl-alt-del in linux,
init executes 'shutdown -r now'. Look at the powerdown entry in
/etc/inittab.

C-A-D "broke" with the release of loadable kernel keytables. The kernel
checks for K_PCOMMA and K_PDOT (Keypad , or Keypad ., for US and non
US keyboards). If you want the old feature back (i.e., stay
"DOS compatible"), edit your keytable and make the "Delete" Key
K_PDOT or K_PCOMMA with an entry like this:

keycode 111 = KP_Comma Remove Remove

This makes the delete key pretty useless for other purposes (so it was
in pre pl10 kernels), and I prefer it the way it is now.

Well, true.  Actually, I think a number of other Unix systems won't crash
and burn under these conditions, but it sure brings a lot of system software
down.

Yup.  The kernel I'm running (0.99.10) allows a maximum of NR_TASKS/2 per
user, and only the super-user gets the last remaining task (IMHO, only the
superuser should get the last, say, 4 tasks, so that the superuser can
run a shell and do reasonably complex things with it in order to bring
the system back to a manageable state).

At least, if you're root.  It would certainly break news, mail, and anything
else that isn't running directly as root (as opposed to simply being suid
root).

I haven't tried it either. Actually I was referring to the Accton cards.
They have BNC thinnet connectors on them. Well worth the $10 extra dollars.

        I got a copy of Object Builder for Linux from ParcPlace and
think it is GREAT.  I have done some event driven programming before
with another GUI development syste (XVT).  I found it easy and
comfortable to get into Object Builder.  Great job, it is exciting
to see such development efforts growing on Linux.
        The only prob is the static libs.  All my progs developed with Object
Builder are 3.0M+  :-<

Hehehehe.  4 or 5 Merge sessions on a single PC say a 486/66 huh.  No
problem as long as noone is _doing_ anything.

I haven't looked at INN so I cannot comment on that, but as for Cnews,
it has no problems. I took a normal source distribution of Cnews (no
linux version) and it compiled and ran fine just like that, without
changes. Also I have no problems with bash and also not in combination
with the cnews shell scripts. But then, I also recompiled bash from
the plain sources, and had to twiddle a bit with the configuration
scripts for it. Maybe that prevented the problem that some experience
with bash. That's a reason I never like to get binaries but always
want to make them myself.

OK, /usr/lib/news and /usr/lib/newsbin contain a lot. But I only need
a few of these programs and files and it is quite clear.

Let's stop with the daily posting, or at least turn it into a monthly
posting with a longer expiration time. It is in my kill file but still
to get this 3K everyday for nothing, I know it's not much but still.

Unshielded twisted pair Ethernet ("10BaseT") boards also consume
much less power (EL3-TP 0.9 watts, EL3-coax 4 watts) than their coax
equivalents and are simpler and more reliable.
Plus, if you pull UTP through your ceiling you'll be ready for
100BaseT (10 times faster than Ethernet) when it hits the street.
Marketing keeps telling me that pulling the cable costs more than
buying the Adapters.  I'm not sure I believe them.

We are in agreement. The only arguments for twisted pair are that a slingle
link failure doesn't bring down the whole net and that in some cases it
can use existing wiring.

But my understanding is that the Accton cards have thinwire BNC connectors.
I'll call tomorrow and find out. I posted the info in another article on
this thread.

Not cost effective. Generic VGA + mono monitor is $150 new. Color SVGA +
14 ince SVGA monitor used is in the $250+ range. Does anyone know of an
inexpesive 800x600 mono SVGA monitor?
