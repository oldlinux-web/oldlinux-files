      This is an excellent opportunity to validate Linux as a viable OS.  I'm

   in getting other 3rd party vendors to notice Linux.

Simcity is not the only one.  I will be changing jobs in a while, to a
company with a *sharp* X11 product.  They want to port it to Linux, if
the user base is there.  I'm considering doing the port for free, to
show that there are people willing to buy it, and then if enough
people buy it, my work will have been justified.

Commercial app vendors are beginning to get interested, but they won't
do the port if it won't sell, so:

If you are interested in the future of commercial apps for Linux, just
ask all the vendors of all the apps you like when they will be doing a
Linux port, and be ready to explain it to them if they don't know
about it, and perhaps send them a copy of the INFO-SHEET (text and DVI
available at tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/docs/INFO-SHEET[.dvi]) to introduce
them.  Heck, you could even fax it to them...

The more people that ask, the more likely these things are to happen.

*Groan*.  I suppose it might be something of a win to do that sort of thing,
but it sure is a shortsighted "solution" to the problem.

Were WordStar and dBase II originally written in assembly or something?  If
not, then why not simply implement the appropriate languages first?

That could be.  My personal opinion is that the success of the IBM PC was
primarily a result of the IBM name (which, to a business at the time,
meant quite a bit).  From that frame of reference, CP/M compatibility
means diddly.  Business software houses were scrambling all over themselves
porting their products to the IBM PC.  Want an example?  Look at PeachTree
accounting, which was running primarily (I believe) on the Apple II at the
time.  If I recall correctly, it came out for the PC only a couple of months
after the PC hit the market.  I was working for a computer store at the
time and remember this kind of thing happening.  It didn't suprise me at
all...

Now *this* I agree with 100%.  My original statement still stands, though:
manufacturers of clones wouldn't have bothered if the PC weren't successful
on its own.  It would be much more of a risk to clone a machine that hadn't
proven itself to be popular.

It's an order of magnitude larger, which means you have that much more
room for growth, which means it'll be that much longer before you have to
redesign.

In particular, it's only *now*, 12 years after the PC came out, that we're
starting to routinely use that much memory.  But it was only a couple of
years after the PC came out that people started hitting the 640k barrier.

>Supporting

This seems to be basically a religious thing.  :-)  Suffice it to say that
each has its ups and downs.

I actually agree that a segmented architecture can be a win, *if* the
segments are as large as your physical address space.  The PC's weren't,
and that's why programmers came to hate the architecture.  It made doing
large arrays *really* painful.

Perhaps, but they didn't *have* to do it that way.  The Amiga is based on
the 68000 and does no such thing (has a blazingly fast windowing system
and operating system, too).

In a protected multitasking environment, segments are probably a win, 
again *if* the segments can be as large as the external addressing space 
(on the 386/486, they can be).  What this means is that *within a 
process* you want a flat addressing space.  Within a process, segments 
don't buy you anything (that I've seen.  I'm sure there are *some* uses, 
but I haven't seen them), particularly when you have lots of 
general-purpose registers and base+offset addressing like the 68000 has, 
and if your segments are small (like they are on the 808x) you lose 
bigtime.

It seems that there are more factors related to this, probably Linux

So it may be that it works for you, it doesn't work for me and others.

I read this as "or *any* real OS" rather than "or any *real* OS".
See the difference? The former implies "or any (other) real OS";
the latter is a suicide note.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in

As one who was heavily involved into pcs of all sort, including the
business end, even back then, I've got to quote the magic mantra:
Lotus 1-2-3.

I've still got magazines from back then with 123 ads all over the
place, editorials and articles gushing about how great it was, etc.
The Big Application of the time was spreadsheets - more so than any
category I can think of today, except maybe graphical operating
systems.  People who had been going wild over Apple ][s and VisiCalc
suddenly had something better.  Plus the IBM name on the PCs.  This
marked the PC as "the" business machine in the eyes of the software
companies and they started cranking them out.  And you started getting
hard drives for all your precious Lotus data - 5 meggers, or if you
had tons of money, ten megs (gasp)!

DOS at the time was horrible, much worse than what was available at
the time (hell, Apple DOS 3.3 blew it away).  The compilers reeked
(this was before Borland started giving them major competition and
forced them to consider the virtues of optimization).  But WordStar
was ported fairly quickly, so the PC had the premiere word processor
of its day.
