I had the problem, too, and checked the man page for ghostview which said:

    If the document does not begin with '%!PS-Adobe-', it does not claim
    conformance to the document structuring convention. When these
    documents are encountered, the functionality of ghostview is limited 
    to giving you scroll bars and a next page capability.

This sounded just fine by me, so I snipped that line off the top and was
able to read the entire document with ghostview 1.5. It didn't list the
page numbers to the left of the lefting area (I'd gotten 1 - 4 before :^),
but it worked fine otherwise.

I noticed the line '%%Creator: Windows PSCRIPT' while I was in there. My
guess is that the program which created the document in at fault, not
ghostview.

Subject: Pls help: Installation problem on VESA local bus PC
Date: Sun, 14 Nov 1993 09:16:21 GMT

Hi there,

I apologize if this's a FAQ.

I tried to install the SLS distribution on a 486DX-2 with VESA local bus
and DTC (Data Technology Corporation) 3270VL VESA SCSI Host Adapter.
The PC has following SCSI device configuration:

SCSI ID : Device
================
0 : 200Mb quantum hard disk (C:)
1 : 200Mb quantum hard disk (D:)
7 : SCSI adapter

and there're 1 primary DOS partition and 1 extended DOS partition (with
2 logical partitions configured) on the first hard disk.

However, error message "scsi: 0 hard disk 0 tape  0 CD-ROM detected..."
(or something like that) is displayed when booting the installation
disk.  The fdisk command also failed for all /dev/sda* devices after the
system was started up.  

I wonder if the DTC VESA SCSI host adapter is supported.  Would anyone
pls advise ?  Thanks a lot !!

Regards,

PS: Pls email your advice to st-wong@cuhk.hk.  Thanks.

Hmmm... This sounds like the Windows PSCRIPT.DRV all right.  Perhaps the
creator of Meta (which was pretty darn good for a Vol.1 Issue.1 mag) can
change the way is creating the *.PS file.  I think the Windows
POSTSCRIPT driver has a check box in the printer setup dialog that says
"Produce Adobe Document Structure Conforming Documents".  The default is
to leave this box *unchecked*.  I think if the author *checks* this box,
the problem may go away.  Maybe someone can "check this out" -- pardon 
the pun! :^)

I also noticed some problems with the postscript file -- the spooler I
am using counted out some 36 pages, but failed to actually output any.
When I opened up the replica version and printed it, all worked out
okay.  (Replica is too darn slow (486DX33) to use as a document reader
-- at least not without a big screen so I don't have to scroll to see
the rest of a page!)

MS-Windows is notorious for producing funky PS output, although I think
that the problem is probably not the main document, but an EPS enclosure
on page 5 (which was created by someone else under MS-Windows, and I did
not look very closely at... very stupid of me). I will look at it on
Monday and see if I can't fix it.

The box was checked, and I'm using an updated driver (the one that 
ships with MSW 3.1 is really old).  As I said, I think the problem
is with an EPS enclosure on page 5.

If you view at 75% you should only have to scroll up and down, and
it should still be readable---that's why I used big (16pt) fonts.

Hallo Linuxers!

I hope, some of you are able to answer me some questions

about 'XFree86' and 'tinyX'.

Here are the questions:

        1. What are the differences between 'XFree86' and 'tinyX'?

        2. What limitations do I have using 'tinyX' in comparison to
           'XFree86'?

        3. What is the latest version of 'tinyX'?

        4. Can I use all common X-client-programs under 'tinyX'?


Many thanks for your help!!! :-)

Mike!

Subject: Looking to buy Linux CD(s)
From: es@ritz.mordor.com (E. Coli)
Date: Mon, 15 Nov 1993 00:31:39 GMT

I'm looking to buy Linux CD(s), if you know of any, please send me all 
the information you can on them.

As complete as possible is the goal, here.  I used to be a Linux person 
until I got pretty fed up with it and went to a commercial Unix.  Now I'm 
damned fed up with the commercial Unix and am going to move back to Linux 
(where I know if I don't like the way something is done, I can get the 
source and fix it.  Argh).

Anyway, send all info on Linux CD's if you have it.

Also, anyone know of good Unix software CD's (source code) other than the 
GNU source CDROM (which I already own the May 1993 edition of...)

Thankx.

The info was originally posted to c.o.l.announce. Here it is again.

The premier issue of Meta is now available in PostScript and Replica
formats, and includes an interview with Linus Torvalds.

Meta is a monthly electronic magazine that covers issues of particular
interest to the net community, including, but not limited to: cryptography,
electronic publishing, free software development, intellectual property, 
internet commercialization, privacy and virtual communities.

Meta is available via email and ftp, and is freely redistributable.

                meta1193.ps.gz (gzip'd PS)
                meta1193.rpl (Replica - requires MS-Windows and Replica viewer)
                meta1193.exe (Replica with embedded Replica viewer)

mail:   send mail to mlinksva@netcom.com with a subject of:

Well, you should take into account that when mib started this thread, he
said that his first posting would be the last he would post about the hurd
until it came out.  Since then, he's posted a dozen more in this thread
defending the hurd development team from those who say the hurd should be
scrapped (after all, we've got Linux, right?).  I can see why he (who
replied to you in your name queries) might be a bit touchy.  Remember, the
more mib posts about the hurd, the less he has time to write the hurd.

I remember the day quite vividly. I was paging through comp.os.minix

it was! Linus anouncing a monolithic kernel (version 0.01??) and would
anyone care to try it out? Andrew S. Tanenbaum flamed him immediately,
saying that monolithic was the way of the past, etc., but people used
his system, expanded it, extended it, improved it, etc, etc, ad

Of course, had anyone known that he was working on such a thing, and
had he announced it to the net beforehand, HE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN A

Yes and no. I depends. :-)

No, you can't modify the Yggdrasil boot floppy since it only contains
a bootable kernel.

What you do is basically:

        1. Create a mini filsystem on the floppy with a bootable
           kernel (with the help of LILO).

        2. Include the necessary binaries to set up the networking
           when you've booted on the floppy.

        3. NFS Mount the CDROM from the remote computer - but see
           below! For example on /mnt.

        4. Mount a ramdisk (or another floppy or something) on
           /mnt/var. Populate it with /mnt/INSTALL/var.tar.gz.

        4. "chroot()" to the mount point of the CDROM (/mnt). You'll
           need to build your own program to do this for you.

        5. Run /INSTALL/install and off you go... (hopefully)

One problem though: You'll need to find a remote machine that *fully*
understands the information on the CDROM. For example SunOS 4 doesn't
seem to understand the way symbolic links is encoded on the CDROM ->
which will prevent you from using a machine running SunOS 4 to
remote-install from. SunOS 5.2 (Solaris 2.2) works just fine though.
(Actually, I haven't tried it on SunOS 4.1.3, but it doesn't work
on SunOS 4.1.2).
