Well, just had a problem related to this thread...

I have ncurses which came with SLS 1.01
With it, I made a small program which does only initscr(), refresh() and
then closes curses and exits. On console or VCs, it runs just fine. On a
terminal connected to serial port (VT100 clone) it coredumps. Some tinkering
with gdb showed that it crashes in refresh, trying to execute
mvcur(0,0,0,0). Any ideas?

Does this rule out developing leading technology stuff as the

That is correct. You do not need to read any single bite to refresh
the entire D-RAM. All you need to do is to sellct a row of bits by strobing
only part of the address lines. It might be helpful to open a data-book
of any D-RAM mfgr and read the description of the first D-RAM chip you
see there.

Subject: DOSEMU compile?
Date: 15 Aug 93 01:48:00 GMT

I'm attempting to compile DOSEMU 0.49 that came with the slackware 1.00
release, I've encountered a couple of problems, one is probably nothing,
but since I'm asking...

...

gcc  -m486 -DAJT=1    -c bios_emm.c -o bios_emm.o
bios_emm.c: In function `map_page':
bios_emm.c:407: warning: initialization of `s_tmp' makes integer from ...
gcc  -m486 -DAJT=1    -c lpt.c -o lpt.o            ... pointer without a cast

.... later on, big trouble strikes ....

lpt.o serial.o mutex.o   -lc -ltermcap -lipc

ld: No such file or directory for libipc

...

I'm assuming the first warning is probably not a big deal, but I haven't 
been able to track down just exactly what is missing for the second one, 
or where it might be.  I'm sure someone has already compiled this, and
knows just what went wrong. :-)

Date: 15 Aug 1993 02:15:42 GMT

I have the same difficulty. Our configurations are similar.

In an xterm, scrolling or horizontal dragging caused the horizontal
chips to pop up. I was using a clone Tseng labs et4000 card.

I do NOT have this problem with an ancient Paradise 512k vga card, but
I can only run mono mode with it , as it does not support 256 colors. 
A STB Powergraph X-24 is on order, which uses the s3 chipset. I am hoping it
will be ok.

Software:
   XFree 1.3, Linux kernel 0.99.pl12alpha

Hardware:
    Soundblaster IRQ 7.
    Com ports.
     14,400 v.42 bis modem with AT&T chipset (COM3).
   IDE controller - 130 MB Seagate (DOS), 340MB Maxtor (DOS+Linux)
   Microsoft bus mouse (IRQ 5).

CPU: AMD 386/40, 8 megs assorted SIMMs,

Under DOS, I should also note that the tseng et4000 acted very odd, messing
up graphics on various video games unless I changed TURBO or the cacheing
parameters.

This was an ISA card.

So you are not the only one with this problem --- I posted a week ago and
didnt really get any answer, though someone did recommend the s3 chip cards.

I have read many people having problems with net-2 sls1.03. I also believe
that route.c is broke. I followed all the istructions and the computer
was working just fine under SLS 1.02. There may also be a problem with
3c503 card setup although at boot everything looks good. It was working
fine under SLS 1.02 with NET-1 code. With SLS 1.03 NET-2 code my network
functions are all hung and occasinally I get the message from eth0: that
there is an IRQ5 conflict and it is resetting it! I could not get any
solution to this. No matter whaÿt I tried with setup I cannot telnet

For the ultimate in convenience, you may like to put the following in the
.kermrc file that is in the directory when you start Kermit:


define rz run rz </dev/ttyS0 >/dev/ttyS0
define sz run sz \%1 </dev/ttyS0 >/dev/ttyS0 where the /dev/ttyS0 is the
serial line connected to the modem.

When it comes time to do the transfer, merely escape back to kermit's
command mode and enter sz <filename> or whatever.

This solution still does not do "nice things" like autostart. Nor have I
been able to do a "resume" on an interrupted transfer.

Subject: Filemarks on Cartridge Tapes (Archive 2525S)
Reply-To: dan@dyndata.com
Date: Fri, 13 Aug 1993 03:30:05 GMT


I remember being able to successfully append to 9-track tapes.  Are
cartridge tapes fundamentally different, or is there something broken
or misconfigured in my drive?  Am I overlooking something?

I try the following:

(foo and bar are files in the current directory)
$ tar cvf /dev/rmt0 foo
foo
(works fine)
$ tar uvf /dev/rmt0 bar
tar: can't write to /dev/rmt0 : I/O error
st0: Error on write filemark:
$

The same thing happens if I use the 'r' flag for tar instead of 'u'.

This is using a brand new Archive Viper 2525S drive, an Adaptec 1542B,
and a fresh installation of Linux from SLS 1.03.  (Although I've seen
similar things happening under Xenix, and under DOS using gnu tar.)

I've also noticed the following:  If I do a tar backup and then a
restore, all the files are restored fine but the tape transport
jiggles the tape a few times at the end, as if it were trying to read
another block but encountering an error.  I would have expected it to
find an end-of-file mark and simply quit.

So is it possible to append to a tar archive on a cartridge?  If you
have an Archive 2525 and can do this under Xenix, DOS, or Linux, I
would like to hear from you to compare notes.

Date: 15 Aug 1993 04:52:20 GMT

I'm having problems compiling two applications that use the "_sigsetjmp"
symbol, "acm" and "xbattle-4.0".  They both use the "_sigsetjmp" symbol,
which doesn't seem to be present in libc.  In the "setjmp.h" it appears
to be both defined as a macro and declared as a function.  I assume the
macro is the one that should be used since its not found in "libc" but

I find this:

#ifdef __linux__
extern int sigsetjmp <lots of parameters>
#else
#ifdef __GNUC__
#define sigsetjmp (one definition)
#else
#define sigsetjmp (some other not strictly POSIX compliant definition)
#endif
#endif /* linux */

Why is it declared a function if the __linux__ symbol is there, when
there is not a function "_sigsetjmp" in the library?

I have similar problems with a tvga8900c (i am assuming that by chips
you mean that the windows echo when scrolling or dragging).  It only
occurs in mono mode when I am using a large virtual screen.

On the other hand I seem to have a flakey board.  I got it because it
didn't work under windows in 1024x768 at 60hz without dropping pixels
and changing colors randomly.  I have similar problems with XFree86 1.3,
so I think it is the hardware (i have also noticed that the problems go
away if the board is kept cool).

I am going to buy a new board when I can afford one (so I'll probably
wait till Xfree2.0 comes out, which should support S3's).  What can
people reccomend in the way of low cost S3 cards (I'm not looking for
killer acceleration, just something that does xterm scrolling pretty
nicely in 1024x768x256 and can put out a 72hz vertical sync (or higher)).

Date: Sun, 15 Aug 1993 05:38:09 GMT


Ok, I have got the Linux base system going.  It's running GREAT on my
486-66 box.  I have a problem though,  It seems I am unable to install
the "Xwindows" portion.  I got the files from:

host  : tsx-11.mit.edu
dir   : /pub/linux/packages/SLS
files : directories x1,x2,...,x10

I got all the files in tar form.  I used minicom to get the files off of
netcom, and into my linux box.  I put all of them in a directory "/XX11"
Here are the things I've tried:

        - used "sysinstall -instsrc /XX11 -X11
        - used "sysinstall -instsrc /XX11 -extracttar x1.tar (nothing happened)
        - used "sysinstall -disk -instsrc /XX11 -X11"
        - used "sysinstall -X11"
        - used "menu" to install (FAT chance!)

I failed on all accounts.  Either it tried to get the files from my 
floppy drive "put disk x1 in drive, and hit return," or it tried to
read the harddrive, and told me that the "diskx1" was missing, and could not
be found.  

What am I doing wrong?  I looked in the FAQs, and found nothing relevant.
I even tried the "-series x" switch to no avail.  After that I moved ALL
files from their respective x1,x2,...,x10 directories to /XX11 directories.
still no luck.  Can anyone help?


I've sucessfully installed the "a" series, the "b" series, the "c" series,
"d" series, and the "s" series.  The difference there was that those 
series were on floppies, and where installed to my HD, where these already
reside on my linux system,but are not installed yet.  What am I doing wrong?

   Hello,

   Question:  Has anyone heard of (or written for that matter) a pcnfs type
   package for the public domain/shareware/GNU arena?  In other words, a 
   package that would allow a PC running DOS to mount a linux file system and
   use it...

   I'm asking this question in c.o.l. mainly 'cause the only file system type
   I'm interested in mounting would be a linux one (ext2fs)...

   It seems to be a fairly non-trivial project to undertake and I was wondering
   if someone has already 'been there, done that'.

   Thank you,

Hi,

        the Un*x side of nfs -- nfsd, is readily availiable. also the 
  deamon PCNFS uses for user authentication and some other stuff, is
  rumored to be availiable in PD ( don't quote me on that.), The tough
  part is finding a NFS client for the PC that is cheap( or free). If
  you do shell out for sun's PCNFS, then whith the PC client side 
  programs, you'll also recieve the source for the deamon(pcnfsd), and
  instructions to build, so even if I was wrong before, you get it 
  anyway. I don't know if this helps. We use PCNFS here at school,
  and like it alot. It beats alot of other networks as far as I'm
  concerned. Mainly by only giving us what we need and nothing more:

  tcp/ip. telnet. nfs. printing. and user authentication through a
  unix server.
