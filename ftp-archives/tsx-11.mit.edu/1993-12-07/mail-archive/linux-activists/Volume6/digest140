Date: Thu, 19 Aug 1993 02:32:25 GMT

Hi hackers.

    I just install linux SLS 1.03 a,b,c series. I tried dosemu yesterday
the first time and it works when I booted from A:.

    Today I tried it again and it failed. I followed the instruction in
dosemu FAQ and recreate the diskimage again, but still cannot make it 
work. Here is the capture dosdbg file:

Peter stuck lib4.4.2 in some SLS changes he made today. Get shlibs.tgz
from out of the distribution.

BTW lib4.4.2 does solve the Class C, Class B net mapping problem.

    However, from my reading of the GPL, this can't happen. While Linus
is free to licence a copy of linux to anyone he want's, previous copies
like 99pl12 are still available under the GPL. The worst that could
happen is that someone could change the executable format so binaries
from MSlinux[tm] couldn't run under GNUlinux. This would proably set
back the linux community a couple of weeks while someone hacked GNUlinux
to load the new format. Big deal. 
    If this got commercial developers porting to linux, it might not
even be all that bad in the long run. ;-)

    A me too here as well. My Conner ide actually gets slightly better

are 650 for scsi, 725 for ide. Neither even comes close to my old Atari

I am using XS3 0.4.3 (I think) and I had some problems with
redrawing until I added the 'nolinear' statement to my xconfig.
Some S3 chips have a problem with linear memory addressing and
need this line in the xconfig (at least that's the way I

This is a bit of a "me too" here... but please read on.  Last night (for
something to do) I installed the Absolute bare bones SLS on a 386 with 2Mb
RAM (who says you can't do it? 8) - basically installing only the [IMP]
packages, and later on the tcpip package from disk B1 (I think :).  Anyway,
this has the abovementioned problem.

HOWEVER, I also installed the entire base (A? + B?) on my 386 and don't have
this problem.  I think this is a SLS distribution problem... or does it happen
with Slackware?

Linux on CD-ROM For Only U$19.95

        We are happy to introduce a new payment plan for the Bimonthly
Linux CD-ROM Distribution.

What is Linux CD-ROM Bimonthly ?

        Every other month you will get every thing that is on TSX-11
FTP site that is related with Linux. This includes SLS 1.2, X
windows other Linux related software. Every other month Ted Tso
who looks after TSX-11 sends me a tape with HD back up of the
/pub/linux directory and I put them on a CD-ROM and send it out. At
present we have about 1000 subscribers.

How much does it cost ?

A one year subscription cost $99.00 and Two years cost $149.00.
If you live out side of USA & Canada then there is a additional
charge of $20 to cover the shipping and customs clearance costs.

If you like to pay by disk then each disk will cost you $19.95
(USA and Canada ) and $22.95 (Outside USA and Canada ). We will
mail you a disk every other month and then bill your credit card
( MasterCard and VISA ). If you would like to get CD-ROMs this
way then there is a half a  year ( 3 CD-ROM's ) minimum
commitment, after that you man cancel or continue your
subscription. By paying this way you are on the safe side and we
will only bill your Credit Card after we ship the disk.

How can I order ?

You can E-Mail us with your address and your credit card number
and expiry date or FAX us at 1-416-922-5597. If you would like
more info then E-Mail me. When you order please let us know
which payment plan you will be choosing. One full payment or
monthly billing.

<EOQ>

I've (not really me but a friend) had some bad experiences with Gateway.

A couple years ago now a friend of mine bought one of their machines
and unfortunately it was at my advice because they seemed to have such
reasonable prices.  We tried to install Interactive Unix System V
release 3.2 on it and it kept bombing, saying it was "unable to read
drive geometry".  I had personally thought that it was the crappy Data
Technology RLL controller they stuck him with since when trying to
install it on one of my machines, the culprit also turned out to be a
Data Technology controller (not very scientific, just my opinion).  I
called them because I had DISTINCTLY asked them on the phone when
ordering this for him as to weather or not it would run Unix and the
woman who was the salesperson said it DEFINATELY WOULD.

Naturally, when I called back and talked to one of their support
people, they said they weren't going to do anything about it because
it "Runs DOS just fine".

Needless to say, I'll never buy another product from Gateway nor will
I ever recommend their crappy products (in my own personal opinion) to
anybody.  ISC Unix, although picky, at that point was probably one of
the most popular Unix versions out there.  If their machine wasn't
capable of supporting it as it was they should of fixed it.  As a
result, there's already several machines people have asked me to order
for them that I've gone elsewhere for.  Those machines run Unix
perfectly.  Apparently if a machine runs MS-DOS, it's an OK machine in
Gateway's opinion... Don't be fooled by their stupid ads (they used to
use Cows, I don't know what they're using in their adds now - nor do I
care.)

Good luck.

Gee, what's the magic about a version number? Are you all really thinking
that things will be stable when 1.0 is available?

Maybe it's time to call  the next version 0.100, so we no longer are
expecting 1.0 'real soon now'. It seems to me a better idea than going
on to 0.99.pl67 (to Linus: I'm not whining about all the releases,

As I remember, Peter McDonald told, that Linus Torvalds decided:

If this were in some FAQ, at least I couldn't find it. So, please, don't
flame for this FAQ-like question -- I tried to do my homework. And if you
noticed that I cross-posted this to a zillion groups, that only says how badly
I'd like to know the answer... ;-]

Anyway, my quest is to find a modem terminal emulation that would do xterm
when dialing into a unix box. If you know of such a thing, could you please
tell me about it? How to tell the unix box about it? It'd be fine if it's for
DOS/Windows, OS2, or linux. If there is one for an OS, chances are that I'll
go with the OS just for that -- or EVEN a Mac (easy, Mac! ;-] I just don't have
a deep pocket and I enjoy poking around computers, that's all). Furthermore,
what about modem-to-modem, as contrary to modem-to-network (ok, phone dial-up)?

BTW, how does a 14.4k modem feel doing graphics stuff like xterm? Of course
I don't mean real-time video. Just lightweight stuff like text scrolling.

The easiest way to make the connection is to take the pc-jr connector
apart, and remove all the wires with the pins intact; then cut the pin
off leaving as much wire to work with as possible. You won't have much
room, they use heat shrink over the wire to protect some resistors and
solder joints. The jr wire colors listed above are the colors that come
from the monitor. Several different colors of wire are used to connect
to the pins. The extra pins are not needed for the monitor, they were
for the speaker and a few other goodies. Just cut them back and tape
them togather, and stuff them into the hood that will cover your DB-9.

Subject: The meaning of DOS
Date: 19 Aug 1993 07:56:06 GMT

I have come to a revelation about DOS, after a long night
of assmebling a Linux network...

DOS does have its uses.  DOS serves as a low level operating
system that can be used to perform maintenance on linux
machines easily because of its small size.  An excellent
analogy would be the PROM monitor on Sun machines compared
to the SunOS.. :)

Subject: DIP problem: mode SLIP gives SETD: Invalid argument
Date: 19 Aug 1993 08:01:46 GMT

When I try to initiate a SLIP connection with a terminal server,
DIP gives me a "SETD: Invalid argument" error when I attempt
to "mode SLIP".

I am setting the remote, port, and speed commands correctly.
(and also the local).

I have the terminal server set to always give me my machine's
IP address, and the terminal server prompts me that SLIP mode
has begun.  The terminal server is an Annex, set to handle
compression.

Thanks in advance for any advice.
