Subject: Mouse Problem and Man Pages
Date: 17 Aug 1993 08:58:48 GMT

I have two questions:

1) Can anyone help me with a rather puzzling mouse problem?

Using MCC .99pl10, I recompiled the kernel to support ps/2 mice, and
now X will recognize the mouse, sort of --  When using X, the cursor
will (quite often) mysteriously jump to the lower left hand corner of the
virtual screen, making it quite difficult to deliberately point at anything.
This pretty much makes X unusable.  I don't think it's a hardware problem
since the mouse functions perfectly under windoze (using the "Microsoft or
PS/2 Mouse" driver).  I have, oddly enough, noticed a similar occurence using
the Norton Utilities with a mouse.
   I've got a Packard Bell (Legend 770) with a "PS/2 compatible" bus mouse.
Any thoughts?

2) Where can I get section 3 of the manual?

Thanks,
   Rick

Reread the entries for getch() and kbhit() in your Borland C++ Library

Wrong answer.  He's talking about separate tapefiles; tar won't read past the
end of the first tapefile.

The answer is:
        mt -f /dev/rmt0 fsf
        tar xvf /dev/rmt0 ...

If he's got the tar from SLS 1.02 or earlier, that won't work.  :-(

As for why gzip won't read the tape directly:  it probably rejects anything
that isn't an ordinary file or a pipe.  In the case of tapes, the tape drive
would probably reject any read attempts anyway unless gzip reads in multiples
of 512 bytes.  (Of course, gzip undoubtedly uses stdio so this isn't likely to
be a problem.)

Date: Wed, 18 Aug 1993 00:10:06 GMT

Well I've checked out the FAQs, and see no mention of this one...

It would appear portmap forks off a child process to do something every
once in a while, but cuts off everything so that the child "zombies out".
Currently my Linux box has been up for just over a day, and there are 7
child portmap zombies (i.e. the original portmap is still running "OK").

I certainly see no error messages vaguely related to this, so wonder
what's going on... (killing and restarting the original portmap cleans up the
zombies BTW).

I wish this were true, but

1) I'm not so sure that unix is for the "masses".  This is debatable,
   but it seems like if you make unix truly "idiot proof", that
   it would no longer be unix.  Look at the benefits of unix from the
   average person's point of view, and they would not understand
   most of the points.

   advantage: great multitasking
      "But Windows lets you do more than one thing at once also"
   advantage: you get all the source code
      "Why would I want that?  You mean you have to compile it?"
      (assuming that they know what compiling is)

2) Unfortunately, marketing comes into the picture more than it
   should.  Many people also equate free with dangerous.

I would only recommend a Unix system to my mother if I were
going to live at home and administer it for her.  Wouldn't have
to worry about my dad, he never touches em ;-)

I think that unix has broadened it's scope and more people are
involved, but it remains to be primarily cs and engineering
students and computer enthusiasts.  The average joe on the street
that just uses a mac to do wordprocessing and play games probably
won't be attracted to such an environment.


I do find Linux very exciting, however.  The rate of improvement +
development is astounding, and I hope it will continue.  I think
it has the potential to do a great deal for the cs field as a
whole.  A young computer hacker in the making no longer has
to start out with something like DOS or Windows, and could be
much more prepared for advanced academic work which inevitably
always uses unix.  I think that the cost factors are particularly
important for many other countries where a copy of Windows is
worth alot more than here in the states.


The one thing I do fear, however, is how Linux will adapt
to the changing architectures.  The x86 line can't continue
for ever, and it would be awful to see Linux die along with
it.  So, when is a PPC or Alpha AXP scheduled for?  Now that
the last official BSD is 4.4, I think that Linux is more
important than ever!

It isn't in public release, if you want to become a alpha tester for it
join the GCC channel.

 You don't actually need lib.4.4.2 to use pl12. Get the source code of route
(in net-010.tar.z and extract from libc-4.4.1 the files libc/inet/inet_net.c
and libc/inet/inetprivate.h
towards the end of the file is a 

#if 1

and some code added by H.J. Lu.  Either remove all this code or just change
the #if 1 to

#if 0

compile route with
gcc -O -o route route.c inet_net.c

And you will get a working route binary. You can find this binary on my
networking rootdisk on ftp.robots.ox.ac.uk in /pub/linux/ox-usr/rootdisk/
if you don't want to compile it yourself. We have several class C networks 
with class B addresses here and everything works fine with this version of
route.

Hello.
I have SLS 1.0, version 0.99.pl6-29
running on a HP Vectra, and an Adaptec 1542B Scsci hOst.
I have a 3com 503 Ethernet board.

Any attempt to access the network, other than loop back,
gets Network is unreachable.
It seems to be identifying my board ok, it sees my
address, i.o and shared memory, it uses my IRQ of 2,
My IP address is configured correctly,
HOWEVER!
I have no access.
I noticed that I don't have a /dev/eth0 or /dev/eth_if
as described in the FAQ.  Should I have?
Should the make Config have created one?
Do I need to create one?

Note, I did read that just because your card works under
Dos, it doesn't mean it isn't broken.  For the record
it has operated under Dos and SCO recently.  What's more,
Dos is running (with FTP) with the same IRQ settings, so
I do not believe it is a conflict.

Thanks for any help anyone can provide.

The fix indeed solves the `cd .' problem. Thanks! Btw, my copy of cd.c had

This would mean the 2742 will not work unless someone writes a driver for it.

First of all this program shouldn't display anything as it doesn't have a
refresh(). Second, you shouldn't use stdio.h routines with curses. Use printw
instead of printf. The cursor always starts at the upperleft corner of the
screen. use move() if you want it somewhere else.
