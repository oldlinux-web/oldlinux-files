LILO  -  Generic Boot Loader for Linux ("LInux LOader") by Werner Almesberger
=============================================================================

Important: The file INCOMPAT contains vital (in)compatibility information
	   for this release of LILO. Read it before proceeding.

Installing boot loaders is inherently dangerous. Be sure to have some means
to boot your system from a different media if you install LILO on your hard
disk.


NOTE: Most of the documentation has moved into the LaTeX document doc.tex.
      This is only a minimal description for those who can't print or pre-
      view LaTeX documents.


Features
--------

  - does not depend on the file system. (Tested with Minix, EXT FS and MS-DOS
    FS.)
  - can be used to boot from floppies and from hard disks.
  - can replace the master boot record.
  - can boot non-Linux systems (MS-DOS, DR DOS, OS/2, ...)
  - supports up to 16 different boot images that can be selected at boot
    time. The parameters like the root disk/partition can be set independently
    for each image. Images can be protected by passwords.
  - boot sector, map file and boot images can be all on different disks or
    partitions.

Installation
------------

Please read the file INCOMPAT for compatibility notes.

The installation procedure is described in the section "Normal first-time
installation". Please read "Booting basics" in the LaTeX document for the
whole story.

*** QUICK INSTALLATION ***

    If you want to install LILO on your hard disk and if you don't want
    to use all its features, you can use the quick installation script.
    Read QuickInst.old or QuickInst.new for details.


The boot prompt
---------------

Immediately after it's loaded, LILO checks, whether one of the following is
happening:

 - any of the [Shift], [Control] or [Alt] keys is being pressed.
 - [CapsLock] or [ScrollLock] is set.

If this is the case, LILO displays the  boot:  prompt and waits for the name
of a boot image (i.e. Linux kernel or other operating system). Otherwise, it
boots the default boot image (The default boot image is either the first boot
image or the image that has been selected at the boot prompt.) or - if a delay
has been specified - waits for one of the listed activities until that amount
of time has passed.

At the boot prompt, the name of the image to boot can be entered. Typing
errors can be corrected with [BackSpace], [Delete], [Ctrl U] and [Ctrl X]. A
list of known images can be obtained by pressing [?] (on the US keyboard) or
[Tab].

If [Enter] is pressed and no file name has been entered, the default image is
booted.

LILO is also able to pass command-line options to the kernel. Command-line
options are words that follow the name of the boot image and that are
separated by spaces. Currently, the kernel recognizes the options
root=<device>,  ro  and  rw , and all current init programs also recognize
the option  single . The option  vga  is processed by the boot loader itself.

single  boots the system in single-user mode. This bypasses all system
initialization procedures and directly starts a root shell on the console.
Multi-user mode can be entered by exiting the single-user shell or by
rebooting.

root=<device>  changes the root device. This overrides settings that may have
been made in the boot image and on the LILO command line. <device> is either
a hexadecimal device number or the full path name of the device, e.g.
/dev/hda3  (The device names are hard-coded in the kernel. Therefore, only the
"standard" names are supported and some less common devices may not be
recognized.)

ro  instructs the kernel to mount the root file system read-only.  rw  mounts
it read-write. If neither  ro  nor  rw  is specified, the setting from the
boot image is used. no387  disables using the hardware FPU.

Depending on the kernel configuration, also some special configuration options
for non-standard hardware may be recognized. Please consult the corresponding
FAQs and HOWTOs for details.

vga=<mode>  alters the VGA mode set at startup. The values NORMAL, EXTENDED,
ASK or a decimal number are recognized.

Other options of the type <variable>=<value> than  root  and  vga  cause the
respective variables to be set in the environment passed to init. The case of
the variable name is preserved. (I.e. it's not automatically converted to
upper case.)

Example:

boot: linux single root=200

LILO always passes the string "BOOT_IMAGE=<name>" to the kernel, where <name>
is the name by which the kernel is identified (e.g. the label). This variable
can be used in /etc/rc to select different behaviour, depending on the kernel.

When booting automatically, the word "auto" is also passed on the command
line. This can be used by init to suppress interactive prompts in the boot
phase.

The default image is typically the first image in the map file. However, after
an unsuccessful boot attempt, the respective image becomes the default image.


Map installer
-------------

The map installer program /etc/lilo/lilo updates the boot sector and creates
the map file. If the map installer detects an error, it terminates immediately
and does not touch the boot sector and the map file.

Whenever the map installer updates a boot sector, the original boot sector is
copied to /etc/lilo/boot.<number>, where <number> is the hexadecimal device
number. If such a file already exists, no backup copy is made. Similarly, a
file /etc/lilo/part.<number> is created if LILO modifies the partition table.


Command-line arguments
----------------------

The LILO map installer accepts the following command-line options:

  -C <config_file>
    Specifies the configuration file that is used by the map installer. If  -C
    is omitted, /etc/lilo/config is used.
  -I <name> options...
    Translates the specified label name to the path of the corresponding
    kernel image and prints that path on standard output. This can be used to
    rebuild files that depend on the kernel (e.g. the ps database). The image
    name can be obtained from the environment variable  BOOT_IMAGE . An error
    message is issued and a non-zero exit code is returned if no matching
    label name can be found. The existence of the image file is verified if
    the option character  v  is added.
  -q
    Lists the currently mapped files.
  -r <root_directory>
    Chroots to the specified directory before doing anything else. This is
    useful when running the map installer while the normal root file system is
    mounted somewhere else, e.g. when recovering from an installation failure
    with an install disk. The  -r  option is implied if the environment
    variable ROOT is set. I.e. if your root partition is mounted on /mnt, you
    can update the map by simply running  ROOT=/mnt /mnt/etc/lilo/lilo .
    The current directory is changed to the new root directory, so using
    relative paths may not work.
  -R <word> ...
    Stores the specified words in the map file. The boot loader uses those
    words as the default command line when booting the next time. That command
    line is removed from the map file by the boot loader by overwriting the
    sector immediately after reading it. The first word has to be the name of
    a boot image. If  -R  is not followed by any words, the current default
    command line in the map file is erased. -R  is typically used in reboot
    scripts, e.g.
	#!/bin/sh
	if /etc/lilo/lilo -R "$*"; then
	    echo | shutdown -r now
	fi
    An error message is issued and a non-zero exit code is returned if the
    command line is not accepted.
  -t 
    Test only. This performs the entire installation procedure except
    replacing the map file and writing the modified boot sector. This can be
    used in conjunction with the  -v  option to verify that LILO will use sane
    values.
  -V
    Print the version number and exit.

There are also many command-line options that correspond to configuration
variables.

  Command-line option	Configuration variable
  -------------------	----------------------
  -b <boot_device>	boot=<boot_device>
  -c			compact
  -d <tsecs>		delay=<tsecs>
  -i <boot_sector>	install=<boot_sector>
  -f <disktab_file>	disktab=<disktab_file>
  -l			linear
  -m <map_file>		map=<map_file>
  -P fix		fix-table
  -P ignore		ignore-table
  -s <backup_file>	backup=<backup_file>
  -S <backup_file>	force-backup=<backup_file>
  -v ...		verbose=<level>

The image files can reside on any media that is accessible at boot time.
There's no need to put them on the root device, although this certainly
doesn't hurt.


Configuration
-------------

The configuration information is stored in the file /etc/lilo/config and
consists of variable assignments. The following syntax rules apply:

 - flag variables consist of a single word and are followed by whitespace or
   the end of the file.
 - string variables consist of the variable name, optional whitespace, an
   equal sign, optional whitespace, the value and required whitespace, or the
   end of the file.
 - a non-empty sequence of blanks, tabs, newlines and comments counts as
   whitespace.
 - variable names are case-insensitive. Values are usually case-sensitive, but
   there are a few exceptions. (See below.)
 - tabs and newlines are special characters and may not be part of a variable
   name or a value. The use of other control characters and non-ASCII
   characters is discouraged.
 - blanks and equal signs may only be part of a variable name or a value if
   they are escaped by a backslash or if the value is embedded in double
   quotes. An equal sign may not be the only character in a name or value.
 - an escaped tab is converted to an escaped blank. An escaped newline is
   removed from the input stream. An escaped backslash (i.e. two backslashes)
   is converted to a backslash. Inside quoted strings, only double quotes can
   be escaped.
 - comments begin with a number sign and end with the next newline. All
   characters (including backslashes) until the newline are ignored.

/etc/lilo/config begins with a possibly empty options section. Most options
can also be set from the command line, but storing permanent options in the
configuration file is more convenient. The following options are recognized:

  BOOT=<boot_device>  Sets the name of the device (e.g. a hard disk partition)
    that contains the boot sector. If BOOT is omitted, the boot sector is read
    from (and possibly written to) the device that is currently mounted as
    root.
  COMPACT  Tries to merge read requests for adjacent sectors into a single
    read request. This drastically reduces load time and keeps the map
    smaller. Using COMPACT is especially recommended when booting from a
    floppy disk.
  DELAY=<tsecs>  Specifies the number of tenths of a second LILO should wait
    before booting the first image. This is useful on systems that immediately
    boot from the hard disk after enabling the keyboard. LILO doesn't wait if
    DELAY is omitted.
  LINEAR  Generate linear sector addresses instead of sector/head/cylinder
    addresses. Linear addresses are translated at run time and do not depend
    on disk geometry. Note that boot disks, where LINEAR is used, may not be
    portable.
  INSTALL=<boot_sector>  Install the specified file as the new boot sector.
    If INSTALL is omitted, /etc/lilo/boot.b is used as the default.
  DISKTAB=<disktab_file>  Specifies the name of the disk parameter table. The
    map installer looks for /etc/lilo/disktab if DISKTAB is omitted.
  MAP=<map_file>  Specifies the location of the map file. If MAP is omitted,
    a file /etc/lilo/map is used.
  MESSAGE=<message_file>  specifies a file containing a message that is
    displayed before the boot prompt. No message is displayed when waiting for
    a shifting key after printing "LILO ". The FF character ([Ctrl L]) clears
    the local screen. The size of the message file is limited to 65535 bytes.
    The map file has to be rebuilt if the message file is changed or moved.
  VERBOSE=<level>  Turns on lots of progress reporting. Higher numbers give
    more verbose output. If  -v  is additionally specified on the command
    line, <level> is increased accordingly.
  BACKUP=<backup_file>  Copy the original boot sector to <backup_file> (which
    may also be a device, e.g. /dev/null) instead of /etc/lilo/boot.<number> 
  FORCE-BACKUP=<backup_file>  Like BACKUP, but overwrite an old backup copy
    if it exists. BACKUP=<backup_file> is ignored if FORCE-BACKUP appears in
    the same configuration file.
  PROMPT  forces entering the boot prompt without expecting any prior
    key-presses. Unattended reboots are impossible if PROMPT is set and
    TIMEOUT isn't.
  TIMEOUT=<tsecs>  sets a timeout (in tenths of a second) for keyboard input.
    If no key is pressed for the specified time, the first image is
    automatically booted. Similarly, password input is aborted if the user is
    idle for too long. The default timeout is infinite.
  SERIAL=<parameters>  enables control from a serial line. The specified
    serial port is initialized and LILO is accepting input from it and from
    the PC's keyboard. Sending a break on the serial line corresponds to
    pressing a shift key on the console in order to get LILO's attention. All
    boot images should be password-protected if the serial access is less
    secure than access to the console, e.g. if the line is connected to a
    modem. The parameter string has the following syntax:
    <port>,<bps><parity><bits>
    The components <bps>, <parity> and <bits> can be omitted. If a component
    is omitted, all following components have to be omitted too. Additionally,
    the comma has to be omitted if only the port number is specified.
    
     <port>  the number of the serial port, zero-based. 0 corresponds to COM1
	alias /dev/ttyS0, etc. All four ports can be used (if present).
     <bps>  the baud rate of the serial port. The following baud rates are
	supported: 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 bps. Default
	is 2400 bps.
     <parity>  the parity used on the serial line. LILO ignores input parity
	and strips the 8th bit. The following (upper or lower case) characters
	are used to describe the parity:  n  for no parity,  e  for even
	parity and  o  for odd parity.
     <bits>  the number of bits in a character. Only 7 and 8 bits are
	supported. Default is 8 if parity is "none", 7 if parity is "even" or
	"odd".
    
    If SERIAL is set, the value of DELAY is automatically raised to 20.
    Example:  serial=0,2400n8  initializes COM1 with the default parameters.
  IGNORE-TABLE  tells LILO to ignore corrupt partition tables.
  FIX-TABLE  allows LILO to adjust 3D addresses in partition tables. Each
    partition entry contains a 3D (sector/head/cylinder) and a linear address
    of the first and the last sector of the partition. If a partition is not
    track-aligned and if certain other operating systems (e.g. PC/MS-DOS or
    OS/2) are using the same disk, they may change the 3D address. LILO can
    store its boot sector only on partitions where both address types
    correspond. LILO re-adjusts incorrect 3D start addresses if FIX-TABLE is
    set.
    WARNING: This does not guarantee that other operating systems may not
    attempt to reset the address later. It is also possible that this change
    has other, unexpected side-effects. The correct fix is to re-partition the
    drive with a program that does align partitions to tracks.
  PASSWORD=<password>  sets a password for all images. (See below.)
  RESTRICTED  relaxes the password protection. (See below.)
  OPTIONAL  makes all images optional. (See below.)

Additionally, the kernel configuration parameters APPEND, RAMDISK, READ-ONLY,
READ-WRITE, ROOT and VGA can be set in the options section. They are used as
defaults if they aren't specified in the configuration sections of the
respective kernel images. See below for a description.

If the option  -q  is specified on the command line, the currently mapped
files are listed. Otherwise, a new map is created for the images described in
the configuration file /etc/lilo/config and they are registered in the boot
sector.

Each image description begins with a special variable and is followed by
optional variables. The following variables can be used for all image
descriptions that describe a Linux kernel:

  APPEND=<string>  Appends the options specified in <string> to the parameter
    line passed to the kernel. This is typically used to specify parameters of
    hardware that can't be entirely auto-detected, e.g.
    append = "hd=64,32,202"
  LITERAL=<string>  Like APPEND, but removes all other options (e.g. setting
    of the root device). Because vital options can be removed unintentionally
    with LITERAL, this option cannot be set in the global options section.
  RAMDISK=<size>  specifies the size of the optional RAM disk. A value of zero
    indicates that no RAM disk should be created. If this variable is omitted,
    the RAM disk size that is configured into the boot image is used.
  READ-ONLY  specifies that the root file system should be mounted read-only.
    Typically, the system startup procedure re-mounts the root file system
    read-write later (e.g. after fsck'ing it).
  READ-WRITE  specifies that the root file system should be mounted
    read-write.
  ROOT=<root_device>  specifies the device that should be mounted as root. If
    the special name  current  is used, the root device is set to the device
    on which the root file system is currently mounted. If the root has been
    changed with  -r , the respective device is used. If the variable ROOT is
    omitted, the root device setting that is contained in the kernel image is
    used. It can be changed with the rdev program.
  VGA=<mode>  specifies the VGA text mode that should be selected when
    booting. The following values are recognized (case is ignored):
    
      NORMAL  select normal 80x25 text mode.
      EXTENDED  select 80x50 text mode. The word EXTENDED can be abbreviated
	to EXT.
      ASK  stop and ask for user input (at boot time).
      <number>  use the corresponding text mode. A list of available modes can
	be obtained by booting with  vga=ask  and pressing [Enter].
    
    If this variable is omitted, the VGA mode setting that is contained in the
    kernel image is used. rdev supports manipulation of the VGA text mode
    setting in the kernel image.

If one of RAMDISK, READ-ONLY, READ-WRITE, ROOT or VGA is omitted in the
configuration file and the corresponding value in the kernel image is changed,
LILO will use the new value.

It is perfectly valid to use different settings for the same image, because
LILO stores them in the image descriptors and not in the images themselves.

Example:

image = /linux
  label = lin-hd
  root = /dev/hda2
image = /linux
  label = lin-fd
  root = /dev/fd0

LILO uses the main file name (without its path) of each image specification
to identify that image. A different name can be used by setting the variable
LABEL (see the example above). A different name for the same entry can be used
by specifying the ALIAS=<name> option.

Images are protected by a password if the variable PASSWORD is set. If the
variable RESTRICTED is set in addition to PASSWORD, a password is only
required to boot the respective image if parameters are specified on the
command line (e.g. single). PASSWORD and RESTRICTED can also be set in the
options section to be the default password and password protection mode for
all images.

If an image section contains the variable OPTIONAL (or if that variable is set
in the options section), the respective image is omitted if its main file is
not available at map creation time. This is useful to specify test kernels
that are not always present.


Boot image types
----------------

LILO can boot the following types of images:

 - kernel images from a file.
 - kernel images from a block device. (I.e. a floppy disk.)
 - the boot sector of some other operating system.

The image type is determined by the name of the initial variable of the
configuration section.

In the configuration sections of all boot images, the following variables are
recognized: ALIAS, LABEL, OPTIONAL, PASSWORD and RESTRICTED.

In the configuration sections of all kernels (i.e. every boot image type
except "other operating system"), the following variables are recognized:
RAMDISK, READ-ONLY, READ-WRITE, ROOT and VGA.


Booting kernel images from a file
-------------------------------

The image is specified as follows: image=<name>

Example:

image = /linux


Booting kernel images from a device
-----------------------------------------------

The range of sectors that should be
mapped, has to be specified. Either a range (<start>-<end>) or a start and a
distance (<start>+<number>) have to be specified. <start> and <end> are zero
based. If only the start is specified, only that sector is mapped.

The image is specified as follows: image=<device_name>  Additionally, the
RANGE variable must be set.

Example:

image = /dev/fd0
  range = 1+512


Booting a foreign operating system
----------------------------------

LILO can even boot other operating systems, i.e. MS-DOS. To boot an other
operating system, the name of a loader program, the device that contains the
boot sector and the device that contains the partition table have to be
specified.

The boot sector is merged with the partition table and stored in the map file.

Currently, the loaders chain.b, os2_d.b and any_d.b exist. chain.b simply
starts the specified boot sector. (The boot sector is loaded by LILO's
secondary boot loader before control is passed to the code of chain.b.)
os2_d.b can boot OS/2 from the second hard disk. any_d.b installs a resident
driver that swaps the first and the second hard disk drive. It can boot any
operating system from the second hard disk, if it uses only the BIOS. This
is known to work for PC/MS-DOS.

The image is specified as follows: other=<device_name> 

The following additional variables are recognized: LOADER, TABLE and UNSAFE.

  LOADER=<chain_loader>  specifies the chain loader that should be used. If it
    is omitted, /etc/lilo/chain.b is used.
  TABLE=<device>  specifies the device that contains the partition table. LILO
    does not pass partition information to the booted operating system if this
    variable is omitted. (Some operating systems have other means to determine
    from which partition they have been booted. E.g. MS-DOS usually stores the
    geometry of the boot disk or partition in its boot sector.)
  UNSAFE  do not access the boot sector at map creation time. This disables
    some sanity checks. If the boot sector is on a fixed-format floppy disk
    device, using UNSAFE avoids the need to put a readable disk into the drive
    when running the map installer. UNSAFE and TABLE are mutually
    incompatible.

Example:

other = /dev/hda2
  label = os2
  table = /dev/hda


Disk parameter table
--------------------

For floppies, IDE disks (or MFM, RLL, ESDI, etc.) and most SCSI disks, LILO
can obtain the disk geometry information from the kernel. Unfortunately, this
is not possible with all SCSI adapters. (The 0.99pl7 kernel provides geometry
information for Adaptec AHA-1542 and AHA-1740, Future Domain TMC-1660,
TMC-1670 and TMC-1680, UltraStor 14F and WD-7000 adapters.) In such cases,
LILO reports either the error
geo_query_dev HDIO_GETGEO (dev 0x<number>)
or
Device 0x<number>: Got bad geometry <sec>/<hd>/<cyl>

The file /etc/lilo/disktab is used to describe such disks. For each device
(/dev/sda -> 0x800, /dev/sda1 -> 0x801, etc.), the BIOS code and the disk
geometry have to be specified, e.g.


# /etc/lilo/disktab  -  LILO disk parameter table
#
# This table contains disk parameters for SCSI disks and non-
# standard parameters of IDE disks. Parameters in disktab
# _always_ override auto-detected disk parameters.

# Dev.  BIOS    Secs/   Heads/  Cylin-  Part.
# num.  code    track   cylin.  ders    offset
#                                      (optional)

0x800   0x80    32      64      631     0       # /dev/sda
0x801   0x80    32      64      631     32      # /dev/sda1
0x802   0x80    32      64      631     204800  # /dev/sda2


Those parameters are just a random example from my system. However, many SCSI
controllers re-map the drives to 32 sectors and 64 heads. The number of
cylinders does not have to be exact, but it shouldn't be lower than the number
of effectively available cylinders.

Note that the device number and the BIOS code have to be specified as
hexadecimal numbers with the "0x" prefix.

The disk geometry parameters can be obtained by booting MS-DOS and running the
program DPARAM.COM with the hexadecimal BIOS code of the drive as its
argument, e.g.  dparam 0x80  for the first hard disk. It displays the number
of sectors per track, the number of heads per cylinder and the number of
cylinders. All three numbers are one-based.

The partition offset is only necessary when using devices for which the kernel
does not provide that information, e.g. CD-ROMs. The partition offset is
counted in sectors and is zero-based.

Because many SCSI controllers don't support more than 1 GB when using the BIOS
interface, LILO can't access files that are located beyond the 1 GB limit of
large SCSI disks on such controllers and reports errors in these cases.


Installation and updates
------------------------

IMPORTANT: The current version of LILO supports two different directory
hierarchies: the old hierarchy, where everything lives in /etc/lilo and a
new hierarchy with files in /sbin, /etc and /boot. Depending on which
hierarchy you want to use, the respective QuickInst and Makefile files
have to be chosen. See INCOMPAT for details.


Compatibility
-------------

The kernel header files have to be in /usr/include/linux and the kernel
usually has to be configured by running  make config  before LILO can be
compiled.

/bin/sh  has to be a real bourne shell. bash is sufficiently compatible, but
some ksh clones may cause problems.

Using command-line options that are handled by init usually requires a
comparably new version of init. All currently available init packages
typically support new features of LILO in the respective next release.

A file named INCOMPAT is included in the distribution. It describes
incompatibilities to older versions of LILO and may also contain further
compatibility notes.


Quick installation
------------------

If you want to install LILO on your hard disk and if you don't want to use all
its features, you can use the quick installation script. Read  QuickInst.old
or  QuickInst.new  for details.

QuickInst can only be used for first-time installations or to entirely replace
an existing installation, _not_ to update or modify an existing installation
of LILO. Be sure you've extracted LILO into a directory that doesn't contain
any files of other LILO installations.


Normal first-time installation
------------------------------

First, you have to install the LILO files:

 - extract all files from lilo.<version>.tar.gz in a new directory. (Don't use
   /etc/lilo for the LILO source. Standard installation procedures fail if the
   source is in the same directory as the production binaries.)
 - configure the  Makefile
 - run  make -f Makefile.old  to compile and assemble all parts if you want to
   use the old directory structure, or  make -f Makefile.new  if you prefer
   the new structure.
 - run  make -f Makefile.old install  or  make -f Makefile.new install  to
   copy all LILO files to /etc/lilo (or to the new directories). /etc/lilo
   should now contain the following files: any_d.b, boot.b, chain.b, disktab,
   lilo and os2_d.b.

If you want to use LILO on a SCSI disk, you might have to determine the
parameters of your SCSI disk(s) and put them into the file /etc/lilo/disktab
(see "Disk parameter table"). If you're using a disktab file, the next step is
to test LILO with the boot sector on a floppy disk:

 - insert a blank (but low-level formatted) floppy disk into /dev/fd0.
 - cd to  /etc/lilo 
 - run  echo image=<kernel_image> | ./lilo -C - -b /dev/fd0 -v -v -v
   If you've already installed LILO on your system, you might not want to
   overwrite your old map file. Use the  -m  option to specify an alternate
   map file name.
 - reboot. LILO should now load its boot loaders from the floppy disk and then
   continue loading the kernel from the hard disk.

Now, your have to decide, which boot concept you want to use. Let's assume
you have a Linux partition on /dev/hda2 and you want to install your LILO boot
sector there. The DOS-MBR loads the LILO boot sector.

 - Get a working boot disk. Verify that you can boot with this setup and that
   you can mount your Linux partition(s) with it.
 - If the boot sector you want to overwrite with LILO is of any value (e.g.
   it's the MBR or if it contains a boot loader, you might want to use if you
   encounter problems with LILO), you should mount your boot disk and make a
   backup copy of your boot sector to a file on that floppy, e.g.
   dd if=/dev/hda of=/fd/boot_sector bs=512 count=1 
 - Link /etc/lilo/install to  lilo  (for backwards compatibility), e.g.
     cd /etc/lilo; ln -s lilo install
 - Create the configuration file /etc/lilo/config, e.g.
   <global settings>
     <image specifications>
     ...
   Be sure to use absolute paths for all files. Relative paths may cause
   unexpected behaviour when using the  -r  option.
 - Now, you can check what LILO would do if you were about to install it on
   your hard disk:
     /etc/lilo/lilo -v -v -v -t 
 - If you need some additional boot utility (i.e. BOOTACTV), you should
   install that now.
 - Run /etc/lilo/lilo to install LILO on your hard disk.
 - If you have to change the active partition, use fdisk or activate to do
   that.
 - Reboot.


LILO update
-----------

When updating to a new version of LILO, the initial steps are the same as for
a first time installation: extract all files, configure the Makefile, run
make  to build the executables and run  make install  to move the files to
/etc/lilo.

The old versions of boot.b, chain.b, etc. are automatically renamed to
boot.old, chain.old, etc. This is done to ensure that you can boot even if the
installation procedure does not finish. boot.old, chain.old, etc. can be
deleted after the map file is rebuilt.

Because the locations of boot.b, chain.b, etc. have changed and because the
map file format may be different too, you have to update the boot sector and
the map file. Run /etc/lilo/lilo to do this.


Kernel update
-------------

Whenever any of the kernel files that are accessed by LILO is moved or
overwritten, the map has to be re-built. (It is advisable to keep a second,
stable, kernel image that can be booted if you forget to update the map after
a change to your usual kernel image.) Run /etc/lilo/lilo to do this.

The kernel has a make target "zlilo" that copies the kernel to /vmlinuz and
runs /etc/lilo/install.


LILO de-installation
--------------------

In order to stop LILO from being invoked when the system boots, its boot
sector has to be either removed or disabled. All other files belonging to LILO
 can be deleted _after_ removing the boot sector, if desired. (Backup copies
of old boot sectors may be needed when removing the boot sector. They are
stored in  \tt /etc/lilo .)

If LILO's boot sector has been installed on a primary partition and is booted
by the "standard" MBR or some partition switcher program, it can be disabled
by making a different partition active. MS-DOS' FDISK, Linux fdisk or LILO's
activate  can do that.

If LILO's boot sector is the master boot record (MBR) of a disk, it has to be
replaced with a different MBR, typically MS-DOS' "standard" MBR. When using
MS-DOS 5.0 or above, the MS-DOS MBR can be restored with  FDISK /MBR . This
only alters the boot loader code, not the partition table.

LILO automatically makes backup copies when it overwrites boot sectors. They
are named /etc/lilo/boot.<nnnn>, with <nnnn> corresponding to the device
number, e.g. 0300 is /dev/hda, 0800 is /dev/sda, etc. Those backups can be
used to restore the old MBR if no easier method is available. The commands are
dd if=/etc/lilo/boot.0300 of=/dev/hda bs=446 count=1  or
dd if=/etc/lilo/boot.0800 of=/dev/sda bs=446 count=1
respectively.

WARNING: Some Linux distributions install boot.<nnnn> files from the system
where the distribution was created in /etc/lilo. Using those files may yield
unpredictable results. Therefore, the file creation date should be carefully
checked.


Installation of other operating systems
---------------------------------------

Some other operating systems (e.g. MS-DOS 6.0) appear to modify the MBR in
their install procedures. It is therefore possible that LILO will stop to
work after such an installation and Linux has to be booted from floppy disk.
The original state can be restored by either re-running /etc/lilo/lilo (if
LILO is installed as the MBR) or by making LILO's partition active (if it's
installed on a primary partition).

Typically, the new operating system then has to be added to LILO's
configuration (and /etc/lilo/lilo has to be re-run) in order to boot it.


Build-time configuration
------------------------

Certain build-time parameters can be configured. They can either be edited in
the top-level Makefile or they can be stored in a file
/etc/lilo/config.defines. Settings in the Makefile are ignored if that file
exists.

The following items can be configured:

  IGNORECASE  Makes image name matching case-insensitive, i.e. "linux" and
    "Linux" are identical. This option is enabled by default. Note that
    password matching is always case-sensitive.
  NO1STDIAG  Do not generate diagnostics on read errors in the first stage
    boot loader. This avoids possibly irritating error codes if the disk
    controller has transient read problems. This option is disabled by
    default.
  NOINSTDEF  If the option INSTALL is omitted, don't install a new boot
    sector, but try to modify the old boot sector instead. This option is
    disabled by default.
  ONE_SHOT  Disables the command-line timeout (configuration variable TIMEOUT)
    if any key is pressed. This way, very short timeouts can be used if PROMPT
    is set. ONE_SHOT is disabled by default.
  READONLY  Disallows overwriting the default command line sector of the map
    file. This way, command lines set with  -R  stay in effect until they are
    explicitly removed. This option is disabled by default.

/etc/lilo/config.defines should be used if one wishes to make permanent
configuration changes. The usual installation procedures don't touch that
file. Example:

-DIGNORECASE -DONE_SHOT


Troubleshooting
---------------

All parts of LILO display some messages that can be used to diagnose problems. 


Map installer errors
--------------------

Most messages of the map installer (/etc/lilo/lilo) should be
self-explanatory. Some messages that indicate common errors are listed below:

  Can't put the boot sector on logical partition <number> 
    An attempt has been made to put LILO's boot sector on the current root
    file system partition which is on a logical partition. This usually
    doesn't have the desired effect, because common MBRs can only boot primary
    partitions. This check can be bypassed by explicitly specifying the boot
    partition with the  -b  option or by setting the configuration variable
    BOOT.
  Device 0x<number>: Got bad geometry <sec>/<hd>/<cyl>
    The device driver for your SCSI controller does not support geometry
    detection. You have to use an /etc/lilo/disktab file.
  Device 0x<number>: Invalid partition table, entry <number>
    The 3D and linear addresses of the first sector of the specified partition
    don't correspond. This is typically caused by partitioning a disk with a
    program that doesn't align partitions to tracks and using PC/MS-DOS or
    OS/2 later on that disk. LILO can attempt to correct the problem, see
    variable FIX-TABLE.
  First sector of <device> doesn't have a valid boot signature
    The first sector of the specified device does not appear to be a valid
    boot sector. You might have confused the device name. (Because different
    partition programs may display the partitions in a different order, it is
    possible that what you think is your first partition isn't /dev/hda1, etc.
    A good method to verify the content of a partition is to try to mount it.)
  geo_comp_addr: Cylinder number is too big (<number> > 1023)
    A file is located beyond the 1024th cylinder of a hard disk. LILO can't
    access such files, because the BIOS limits cylinder numbers to the range
    0...1023. Try moving the file to a different place, preferably a partition
    that is entirely within the first 1024 cylinders of the disk.
  Hole found in map file (<location>) 
    The map installer is confused about the disk organization. Please report
    this error.
  <item> doesn't have a valid LILO signature
    The specified item has been located, but is not part of LILO. If <item> is
    the first boot sector, you've probably forgotten to specify the  -i
    option or the  install variable to install the LILO boot sector.
  <item> has an invalid stage code (<number>)
    The specified item has probably been corrupted. Try re-building LILO.
 <item> is version <number>. Expecting version <number>.
    The specified entity is either too old or too new. Make sure all parts of
    LILO (map installer, boot loaders and chain loaders) are from the same
    distribution. If <item> is the first boot sector, you have to run the map
    installer with the  -i  option to update it. (The expected version number
    may be different from the version number of the LILO package.)
  Kernel <name> is too big 
    The kernel image (without the setup code) is bigger than 512 kbytes. LILO
    would overwrite itself when trying to load such a kernel. Try removing
    some unused drivers and compiling the kernel again.
  Partition entry not found 
    The partition from which an other operating system should be booted isn't
    listed in the specified partition table. This either means that an
    incorrect partition table has been specified or that you're trying to boot
    from a logical partition. The latter usually doesn't work. You can bypass
    this check by omitting the partition table specification (e.g. omitting
    the variable TABLE).
  Sorry, don't know how to handle device <number> 
    LILO uses files that are located on a device for which there is no easy
    way to determine the disk geometry. Such devices have to be described in
    the file /etc/lilo/disktab.


LILO start message
------------------

When LILO loads itself, it displays the word "LILO". Each letter is printed
before or after performing some specific action. If LILO fails at some point,
the letters printed so far can be used to identify the problem. This is
described in more detail in the technical overview.

Note that some hex digits may be inserted after the first "L" if a transient
disk problem occurs. Unless LILO stops at that point, generating an endless
stream of error codes, such hex digits do not indicate a severe problem.

  (nothing)  No part of LILO has been loaded. LILO either isn't installed or
    the partition on which its boot sector is located isn't active.
  L<error>...  The first stage boot loader has been loaded and started, but
    it can't load the second stage boot loader. The two-digit error codes
    indicate the type of problem. (They are described in the next section.)
    This condition usually indicates a media failure or a geometry mismatch
    (e.g. bad parameters in /etc/lilo/disktab).
  LI  The first stage boot loader was able to load the second stage boot
    loader, but has failed to execute it. This can either be caused by a
    geometry mismatch or by moving /etc/lilo/boot.b without running the map
    installer.
  LIL  The second stage boot loader has been started, but it can't load the
    descriptor table from the map file. This is typically caused by a media
    failure or by a geometry mismatch.
  LIL?  The second stage boot loader has been loaded at an incorrect address.
    This is typically caused by a subtle geometry mismatch or by moving
    /etc/lilo/boot.b without running the map installer.
  LIL-  The descriptor table is corrupt. This can either be caused by a
    geometry mismatch or by moving /etc/lilo/map without running the map
    installer.
  LILO  All parts of LILO have been successfully loaded.


Disk error codes
----------------

If the BIOS signals an error when LILO is trying to load a boot image, the
respective error code is displayed. The following BIOS error codes are known:

  0x00  Internal error. This code is generated by the sector read routine of
    the LILO boot loader whenever an internal inconsistency is detected. This
    might be caused by corrupt files, try re-building the map file.
  0x01  Illegal command. This shouldn't happen.
  0x02  Address mark not found. This usually indicates a media problem. Try
    again several times.
  0x03  Write-protected disk. This shouldn't happen.
  0x04  Sector not found. This typically indicates a geometry mismatch. If
    you're booting a raw-written disk image, verify whether it was created for
    disks with the same geometry as the one you're using. If you're booting
    from a SCSI disk, you should check, whether LILO has obtained correct
    geometry data from the kernel or whether the contents of your
    /etc/lilo/disktab file corresponds to the real disk geometry. Removing
    COMPACT may help too.
  0x06  Change line active. This should be a transient error. Try booting a
    second time.
  0x08  DMA overrun. This shouldn't happen. Try booting again.
  0x09  DMA attempt across 64k boundary. This shouldn't happen. Try omitting
    the  -c  option and report this problem to the author.
  0x0C  Invalid media. This shouldn't happen and might be caused by a media
    error. Try booting again.
  0x10  CRC error. A media error has been detected. Try booting several times,
    running the map installer a second time (to put the map file at some other
    physical location or to write "good data" over the bad spot), mapping out
    the bad sectors/tracks and, if all else fails, replacing the media.   
  0x20  Controller error. This shouldn't happen.
  0x40  Seek failure. This might be a media problem. Try booting again.
  0x80  Disk timeout. The disk or the drive isn't ready. Either the media is
    bad or the disk isn't spinning. If you're booting from a floppy, you might
    not have closed the drive door. Otherwise, trying to boot again might
    help.


Other problems
--------------

This section contains a collection of less common problems that have been
observed.

  - For yet unknown reasons, LILO may fail on some systems with AMI BIOS
    if the "Hard Disk Type 47 RAM area" is set to "0:300" instead of
    "DOS 1K".
