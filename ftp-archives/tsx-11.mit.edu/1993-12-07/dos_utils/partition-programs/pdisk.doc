This stuff is mostly self explanatory, but:
	part takes one optional argument, which is the disk number with
	which to start (either 0 or 1. 0 is default).

	286pd1.sys and 286pd2.sys are for driving partitions on your first
	and second disks, respectively.  They will only work on 80186 or higher
	processors.  For 8086/8088 computers, use pdisk1.sys, pdisk2.sys. They
	are just a *wee* bit slower....

	fdins is for use when you're short of free space in "low menory" --
	i.e. free interrupt vectors.  fdintins, on the other hand, doesn't
	use up any application space memory.  In either case, these programs
	don't do *anything* directly -- you run them in order to create a
	.COM program that does the dirty work.  You get TBL1.com, TBL2.com,
	TBL1INT.com, or TBL2INT.com, depending on whether you run fdins,
	fdintins and specifiy disk 1 or 2 (== 0 or 1).

	pformat is for when you want to be particularly destructive with your
	new partition.  You run "pformat <drive>:" where <drive> must be a
	valid pdisk.  It's good for marking newly developed bad sectors,
	I guess.  Be careful.

According to tests I ran with the PC Magazine benchmark program, disk access
to a pdisk is actually faster than the normal DOS driver (i.e. C: or a DOS
3.3/4.x extended DOS partition).  (This may only be true using the 286 version,
and may be affected by your usage.  The main point is that you certainly do
not take a performance *cut* by using my program.)

I am not including most of the COPYING file that comes with stuff from the
Free Software Foundation (Richard Stallman, et al.) because I don't know
if I'm allowed, but that's what I intend for this software.  Specifically,
you can *give* away as many copies of this software as you like.  You can
charge a *reasonable* handling fee.  You can even incorporate parts of it
into other projects, as long as you distribute at least the source you got
from pdisk.  I don't want money or contributions, I want plaudits.  I hope
this software is helpful to you.

When you find the inevitable bug (there are *none* in the driver, but I
don't absolutely swear for the partitioning program), please try to
fix it yourself and let me know the solution.  Failing that, drop me a
line describing the situation exactly, especially including DOS version and
all hardware, including fixed disk and controller type.  I don;t promise
to do anything about it, but I might.

One thing I recommend from experience:  my boot code will only work on some
IBM compatibles.  It is best to use the manafacturer's (or generic) MSDOS
fdisk to set up the initial partition, then use "format c: /s" to set up
your bootable DOS partition.  If you can get this working right with pdisk,
that would be nice.

have fun.  Scott E. Garfinkle
