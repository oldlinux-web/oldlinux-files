This is a new version of the ethercard drivers.

The new features are:

	PING-PONG transmit!  This can almost double the transmit rate in some
	cases.  1MB/sec is now possible!!!

	The 'ne' driver autoselects between the NE1000 and NE2000 modes.
	There is a less-intrusive 3c503 probe.
	The 3c503 can now be used in non-shared-memory mode.
	The HP-LAN non-autoIRQ mode should now work.
	The WD driver should now work with some older WD8003 cards, but this
	is untested.
