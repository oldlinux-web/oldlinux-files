DESCRIPTION
     ############ NEXT ENTRY HAS NOT BEEN CHECKED #############

     The time of last modification is set to the current time.   This  command
     is  mostly  used  to  trick make into thinking that a file is more recent
     than it really is.  If the file being  touched  does  not  exist,  it  is
     created, unless the -c flag is present.
