DESCRIPTION

     Last Searches backward through the login administration file (default  is
     /usr/adm/wtmp),  printing  information about previous logins and reboots.
     During a long search, the SIGQUIT signal (CTRL-\) causes last to  display
     how far back it has gone; it then continues.
