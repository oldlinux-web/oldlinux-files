DESCRIPTION

     It commonly occurs that cdifs are posted to USENET.  After  installing  a
     cdif  file, it is sometimes desirable to print out the new file, with the
     changes marked on it.  Whatsnew does precisely this, with the  changes  +
     and ! printed in the right-hand margin.
