NAME
     shar - shell archiver

SYNOPSIS
     shar file ...

EXAMPLES

     shar *.c >s         # Collect C programs in shell archive

     sh <s               # Extract files from a shell archive

DESCRIPTION

     The named files are collected together into a shell archive written  onto
     standard  output.   The  individual files can be extracted by redirecting
     the shell archive into the shell.  The advantage of shar over ar is  that
     shar  archives  can  be read on almost any UNIX system, whereas numerous,
     incompatible versions of ar are in widespread use.  Extracting the  files
     from a shell archive requires that sed be accessible.
