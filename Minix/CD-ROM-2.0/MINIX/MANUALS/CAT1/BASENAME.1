NAME
     basename, dirname - strip off file prefixes and suffixes

SYNOPSIS
     basename file [suffix]
     dirname file

OPTIONS
     (none)

EXAMPLES

     basename /user/ast/file.c
                         # Strips path to yield file.c

     basename /user/file.c .c
                         # Strips path and .c to yield file

     dirname /user/file.c
                         # Strips basename to yield /user

DESCRIPTION

     Basename removes the initial directory names (if any) yielding  the  name
     of  the  file itself.  If a second argument is present, it is interpreted
     as a suffix and is also stripped, if present.

     Dirname removes the final component of a path, yielding the  directory  a
     file is in.

     These programs are primarily used in shell scripts.
