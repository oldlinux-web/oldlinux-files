NAME
     tget - get termcap values

SYNOPSIS
     tget [-flag id] [-num id] [-str id] [-goto col line] [[-echo] string]

DESCRIPTION
     Tget allows shell scripts access to  the  termcap(3)  functions.   Flags,
     numbers  and  strings  can be queried from the termcap database under the
     entry denoted by the environment variable $TERM.

OPTIONS

     -flag id
          Set the exit status to zero if  the  flag  id  is  set.   All  other
          options  except  -echo  set the exit status to id being available or
          not.  The last option sets the final exit code.

     -num id
          Print the value of the numeric variable id.

     -str id
          Print the value of the string variable id.

     -goto col line
          Generates instructions to go to the given column and line if the  cm
          capability exists.

     -echo string
          Prints string.  Any other argument that does not start with  a  dash
          is also printed.
