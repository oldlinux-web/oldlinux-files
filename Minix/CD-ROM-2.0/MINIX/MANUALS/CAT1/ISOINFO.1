NAME
     isoinfo - list an ISO9660 or High Sierra volume descriptor

SYNOPSIS
     isoinfo [input_file]

DESCRIPTION
     Isoinfo reads the volume descriptor from an ISO9660 or High Sierra  Group
     file  system  (usually  residing  on  cdrom)  and  lists  its contents on
     standard output.  isodir, isoread, and isoinfo are all links to the  same
     program.   The  program  sees which function to perform by looking how it
     was called.

BUGS
     Only Interchange level-1  is  supported.  The  Red  Rock  extensions  and
     Interchange level-2 are not implemented.

SEE ALSO
     isodir(1), isoread(1).
