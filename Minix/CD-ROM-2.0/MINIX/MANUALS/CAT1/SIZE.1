NAME
     size - print text, data, and bss size of a program

SYNOPSIS
     size [file] ...

EXAMPLES

     size file           # Print the size of file

DESCRIPTION

     The text, data, bss, and total sizes for each argument are  printed.   If
     no  arguments  are  present,  a.out  is  assumed.   The  amount of memory
     available for combined stack and data segment growth is  printed  in  the
     column  'stack.' This is the value manipulated by the chmem command.  The
     total amount of memory allocated to the program  when  it  is  loaded  is
     listed  under  'memory.'  This  value  is  just the sum of the other four
     columns.
