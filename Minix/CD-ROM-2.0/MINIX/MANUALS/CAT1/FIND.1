NAME
     find - find files meeting a given condition

SYNOPSIS
     find directory expression

EXAMPLES

     find /  -name a.out -print
                         # Print all a.out paths

     find /usr/ast ! -newer f -ok rm {} \\;
                         # Ask before removing

     find /usr -size +20 -exec mv {} /big \\;
                         # move files > 20 blks

     find / ( -name a.out -o -name '*.o' ) -exec rm {}\\;
                         # 2 conds

DESCRIPTION

     Find descends the file tree starting at the given directory checking each
     file  in  that  directory and its subdirectories against a predicate.  If
     the predicate is true,  an  action  is  taken.   The  predicates  may  be
     connected by -a (Boolean and), -o (Boolean or) and !  (Boolean negation).
     Each predicate is true under the conditions specified below.  The integer
     n  may  also be +n to mean any value greater than n, -n to mean any value
     less than n, or just n for exactly n.

        -name s  true if current filename is s (include shell wild cards)
        -size n  true if file size is n blocks
        -inum n  true if the current file's i-node number is n
        -mtime n true if modification time relative to today (in days) is n
        -links n true if the number of links to the file is n
        -newer f true if the file is newer than f
        -perm n  true if the file's permission bits = n (n is in octal)
        -user u  true if the uid = u (a numerical value, not a login name)
        -group g true if the gid = g (a numerical value, not a group name)
        -type x  where x is bcdfug (block, char, dir,  regular  file,  setuid,
     setgid)
        -xdev    do not cross devices to search mounted file systems

     Following the expression can be one of the following, telling what to  do
     when a file is found:

        -print   print the file name on standard output
        -exec    execute a MINIX command, {} stands for the file name
        -ok      prompts before executing the command



                                                                             1
