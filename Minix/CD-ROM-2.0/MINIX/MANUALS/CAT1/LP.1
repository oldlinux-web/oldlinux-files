NAME
     lp, lpd - copy a file to the line printer

SYNOPSIS
     lp [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Each file argument to lp is send to  the  line  printer  to  be  printed.
     Standard  input  is  read  and  printed  if  there  are no arguments.  Lp
     executes /usr/lib/lpd with each file as input.   Lpd  puts  the  file  in
     /usr/spool/lpd and starts printing the jobs on /dev/lp unless another lpd
     is already running.  If lpd finds any character  in  the  input  that  it
     doesn't  know  how  to  handle  then  it  will print the rest of the file
     without any special treatment.  This also means that no formfeed is  sent
     after  the  file  has  been  printed  to  force out the page.  Lpd simply
     assumes that you know what you are doing.  (dumb, eh?)

     Note: Don't do anything with a file until it is printed, lpd only makes a
     copy  of a file in the spool directory when it is not world readable.  If
     it can be read then it is printed directly.

FILES

     /usr/spool/lpd/jobXXXXX
                         Information about a job.

     /usr/spool/lpd/tmpXXXXX
                         Associated file to be printed.

     /etc/termcap        The 'lp' entry describes the printer by the "li#" and
                         "co#"  fields.   By  default 66 lines (li#66), and 80
                         columns (co#80).

SEE ALSO
     lp(4), termcap(5), termcap(7).

BUGS
     Not spooling a world readable file may not be such a smart idea.

     A formfeed should be printed and the printer reset after a  job  full  of
     escape codes, but this may cost paper.

     No banner page.
