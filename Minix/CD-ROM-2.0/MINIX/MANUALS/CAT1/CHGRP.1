NAME
     chgrp - change group

SYNOPSIS
     chgrp [-R] [owner:]group file ...

OPTIONS

     -R   Change directory hierarchies

EXAMPLES

     chgrp system file1 file2
                         # Make system the group of the files

     chrgp -R other dir1 # Make other the group of all files below dir1

DESCRIPTION

     The group field (and optionally  owner  field)  of  the  named  files  is
     changed  to  group  and owner . Alternatively, a decimal gid (uid) may be
     specified instead of a group name.  If the -R flag is used,  the  changes
     will  be  applied recursively to all files in named directories. Only the
     superuser may execute this command to set arbitrary groups. Normal  users
     can  only  change  the group if they own the file, and the group is their
     own group (Minix), or one of their supplementary groups (Minix-vmd).
