NAME
     mkdir - make a directory

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-p] [-m mode] directory ...

OPTIONS

     -m   Create directory with mode

     -p   Create missing intermediate directories

EXAMPLES

     mkdir dir           # Create dir in the current directory

     mkdir -p /user/ast/dir
                         # Create the /user/ast and /user/ast/dir

DESCRIPTION

     The specified directory or directories are created  and  initialized.  If
     any  intermediate  directory  is missing and -p is specified, the missing
     component will be created and no error  displayed  if  directory  already
     exists. If the -m flag is used, this will be equivalent to a chmod on the
     directory after its creation.

SEE ALSO
     chmod(1), rmdir(1), mkdir(2).
