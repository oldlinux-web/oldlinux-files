NAME
     readall - read a device quickly to check for bad blocks

SYNOPSIS
     readall [-bt] file

OPTIONS

     -b   Produce shell script on stdout that calls badblocks

     -t   Just print device size

EXAMPLES

     readall /dev/hd0    # Read all of /dev/hd0

     readall -b /dev/hd1 >s
                         # Generate shell script on s

DESCRIPTION

     Readall reads all of the named device in large chunks. It  reports  about
     blocks  that  it  cannot  read.  Unlike diskcheck, it does not attempt to
     write on the disk, making it safer to use when one  is  worried  about  a
     sick  system.   When  the  -b flag is given, the output is a shell script
     that calls the badblocks program to marked all the bad blocks.   Whenever
     installing MINIX, it is wise to run readall with the -b flag first on all
     the hard disks.
