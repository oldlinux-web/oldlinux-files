DESCRIPTION

     Cp copies one file  to  another,  or  copies  one  or  more  files  to  a
     directory.   Special  files  are  normally  opened and read, unless -r is
     used.  -r also copies the  link  structure,  something  -R  doesn't  care
     about.   The  -s  option differs from -p that it only copies the times if
     the target file already exists.  A normal copy only copies  the  mode  of
     the  file, with the file creation mask applied.  Set-uid bits are cleared
     if the owner cannot be set.  (The -s  flag  does  not  patronize  you  by
     clearing bits.  Alas -s and -r are nonstandard.)

     Cpdir is a convenient synonym for cp -psmr to make a precise  copy  of  a
     directory tree.
