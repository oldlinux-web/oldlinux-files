NAME
     cdiff - context diff

SYNOPSIS
     cdiff [-cn] oldfile newfile

OPTIONS

     -c   Provide n lines of context

EXAMPLES

     cdiff old new >f    # Write context diff on f

     cdiff -c1 old new >f
                         # Use only 1 line of context

DESCRIPTION

     Cdiff produces a context diff by  first  running  diff  and  then  adding
     context.  Some  update  programs,  like  patch,  can use context diffs to
     update files, even in the presence of other, independent changes.
