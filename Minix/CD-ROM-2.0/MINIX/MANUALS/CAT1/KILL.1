     A signal is sent to a given process.  By default signal 15  (SIGTERM)  is
     sent.   Process  0 means all the processes in the sender's process group.
     A process group can be signalled by the negative  value  of  the  process
     group  ID.   Signals  may be numerical, or the name of the signal without
     SIG.
