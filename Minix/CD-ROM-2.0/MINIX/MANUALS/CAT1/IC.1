NAME
     ic - integer calculator

SYNOPSIS
     ic [expression]

EXAMPLES

     ic                  # Start the calculator

     ic 250 300+         # Start calculator with 550 on the stack

DESCRIPTION

     Ic is a simple RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator, used  for  small
     calculations and base conversions. All calculations are done using 32 bit
     integers.  The standard input is usually  a  keyboard  and  the  standard
     output  requires  a device with a 'termcap' entry.  The program starts by
     interpreting  any  <args>  as  commands,  where  the  separation  between
     arguments is considered to be the same as the ENTER key. For example,

             ic 692 784+

     After reading the arguments input is from the keyboard.

  Stack Operations

     The operation of this program is similar to an  RPN  calculator.   A  six
     level  stack  is  used.  The ENTER key pushes the stack up one level. For
     example, '12+5' is entered as '12 ENTER 5 +".

     The top two entries on the stack are exchanged by the x command, and  the
     stack is rolled down one (popped) by the p key.  The top of the stack may
     be cleared by pressing the  back-space  key.  The  whole  stack  and  the
     registers are initialized by a z.

  Numeric Entry

     The input and output bases are initially decimal, but they may be changed
     using  the  i and o commands. The i command changes both bases, but the o
     command changes  just  the  output  base.   These  commands  take  a  one
     character  argument  of  h,  d, o or b to change to Hexadecimal, Decimal,
     Octal or Binary. While the  input  base  is  hexadecimal  the  letters  a
     through f are used to represent the decimal values 10 through 15.

     When the input base  is  decimal:  multiply,  divide  and  remainder  are
     signed, otherwise they are performed unsigned.





                                                                             1

     The output base may also be changed to ASCII (a), this causes  the  least
     significant 7 bits of a value to be displayed as a character. To input an
     ASCII value the translate  (t)  command  may  be  used,  it  accepts  one
     character as its argument.

  Calculations

     The  arithmetic  operations  supported  are:  Negate  ('.'),  Add  ('+'),
     Subtract  ('-'),  Multiply ('*'), Divide ('/'), and Remainder ('%').  The
     logical (Boolean) operations available are:  NOT  ('~'),  AND  ('&'),  OR
     ('|'), and EXCLUSIVE-OR ('^').

     After one of these operations the last top of stack value  is  saved.  It
     may be restored by pressing l (L).

  Saving Results

     Ten temporary registers are available. The Store (s) command followed  by
     a  digit  ('0'..'9')  will  copy  the  top  of the stack to the specified
     register. The Recall (r) command pushes the contents of a  register  onto
     the top of the stack.

     If the Store command is followed by a '+' preceding the digit,  then  the
     top of the stack will be added to the specified 'accumulator' register.

     Values may also be written to a file. The w command writes the top of the
     stack,  using  the  current  output  base,  to a file called 'pad' in the
     current directory.  If the user does not have write access to the current
     directory  then  the  file /tmp/pad_$USER is used as the scratch pad. The
     scratch pad file is erased on the first use of the w command within  each
     new invocation of 'ic'.

  Miscellaneous

     The Quit (q) key causes an immediate  exit.  The  m  command  temporarily
     leaves  ic  by invoking the shell as a sub-process.  For help while using
     ic, hit the h key. If an erroneous key is pressed the bell will sound.

  Command Summary

     Note that many commands have an alternative  key-code  available  on  the
     extended  AT  keyboard. This aids entry by including most commands on the
     right side of the keyboard.
