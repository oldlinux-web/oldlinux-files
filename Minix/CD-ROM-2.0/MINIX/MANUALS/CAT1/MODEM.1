NAME
     modem - switch the modem and getty state

SYNOPSIS
     modem [-o] [-i num] ttyn

OPTIONS

     -o   Turn getty off and set modem to dialout

     -i   Set line to dialin

EXAMPLES

     modem -o tty00      # Set tty00 to dialout

     modem -i2 tty00     # Set tty00 to dialin (2 rings)

DESCRIPTION

     The getty program allows a terminal port to be used for both  dialin  and
     dialout.  This  little  program  switches the getty state, and also sends
     some commands to the modem attached to the specified  line.   If  the  -o
     flag  is  presnt,  modem will put the getty process (if any) connected to
     the specified line into SUSPEND state, which means that it will  not  pay
     attention  to  that line until it is reset to RESTART state.  Also, modem
     will send some (Hayes) commands to the  attached  modem  to  disable  the
     auto-nanswer  mode.  The  -i  flag  specifies  the  number  of  times the
     telephone has to ring before the modem may answer the call (to  give  the
     operator a chance).
