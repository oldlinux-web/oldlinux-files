                         # Extract two files from the archive

DESCRIPTION

     Tar is a POSIX-compatible archiver, except that it  does  not  use  tape.
     It's  primary  advantage  over ar is that the tar format is somewhat more
     standardized than the ar format,  making  it  theoretically  possible  to
     transport  MINIX files to another computer, but do not bet on it.  If the
     target machine runs MS-DOS , try doswrite .
