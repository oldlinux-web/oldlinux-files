NAME
     write - send a message to a logged-in user

SYNOPSIS
     write [-cv] user [tty]

OPTIONS

     -c   Use cbreak mode

     -v   Verbose mode

EXAMPLES

     write ast           # Send a message to ast

     write ast tty00     # Send a message to ast on tty00

DESCRIPTION

     Write lets a user send messages to another logged-in user. Lines typed by
     the  user appear on the other user's screen a line at a time (a character
     at a time in the case of cbreak mode). The file /usr/adm/wtmp is searched
     to  determine  which tty to send to. If the user is logged onto more than
     one terminal, the tty argument selects the terminal.   Type  CTRL-  D  to
     terminate the command.  Use ! as a shell escape.
