NAME
     patch - apply a diff file to an original

SYNOPSIS
     patch [options] [origfile [patchfile]] [+ [options] [origfile]]...

     but usually just

     patch <patchfile

DESCRIPTION
     Patch will take a  patch  file  containing  any  of  the  four  forms  of
     difference   listing  produced  by  the  diff  program  and  apply  those
     differences to  an  original  file,  producing  a  patched  version.   By
     default,  the  patched  version is put in place of the original, with the
     original file backed up to the same name  with  the  extension  ``.orig''
     (``~'' on systems that do not support long filenames), or as specified by
     the -b, -B, or -V switches.  The extension used for making  backup  files
     may  also  be specified in the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX environment variable,
     which is overridden by above switches.

     If the backup file already exists, patch creates a new backup  file  name
     by  changing  the  first  lowercase  letter  in the last component of the
     file's name into uppercase.  If there are no more  lowercase  letters  in
     the  name, it removes the first character from the name.  It repeats this
     process until it comes up with a backup file that does not already exist.

     You may also specify where you want the output to go with a -o switch; if
     that file already exists, it is backed up first.

     If patchfile is omitted, or is a hyphen, the  patch  will  be  read  from
     standard input.

     Upon startup, patch will attempt  to  determine  the  type  of  the  diff
     listing,  unless over-ruled by a -c, -e, -n, or -u switch.  Context diffs
     (old-style, new-style, and unified) and normal diffs are applied  by  the
     patch  program itself, while ed diffs are simply fed to the ed editor via
     a pipe.

     Patch will try to skip any leading garbage, apply the diff, and then skip
     any  trailing  garbage.   Thus  you  could  feed  an  article  or message
     containing a diff listing to patch, and it should work.   If  the  entire
     diff is indented by a consistent amount, this will be taken into account.

     With context diffs, and to a lesser extent with normal diffs,  patch  can
     detect  when  the  line numbers mentioned in the patch are incorrect, and
     will attempt to find the correct place to apply each hunk of  the  patch.
     As  a  first guess, it takes the line number mentioned for the hunk, plus
     or minus any offset used in applying the previous hunk.  If that  is  not
     the  correct place, patch will scan both forwards and backwards for a set


                                    LOCAL                                    1



PATCH(1)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   PATCH(1)


     of lines matching the context given in the hunk.  First patch looks for a
     place  where  all lines of the context match.  If no such place is found,
     and it's a context diff, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 1 or more,
     then  another  scan  takes  place  ignoring  the  first  and last line of
     context.  If that fails, and the maximum fuzz factor is set to 2 or more,
     the first two and last two lines of context are ignored, and another scan
     is made.  (The default maximum fuzz factor is 2.)  If patch cannot find a
     place  to  install  that hunk of the patch, it will put the hunk out to a
     reject file, which normally is the name of the output file plus  ``.rej''
     (``#''  on  systems  that do not support long filenames).  (Note that the
     rejected hunk will come out in context diff form whether the input  patch
     was  a  context  diff  or a normal diff.  If the input was a normal diff,
     many of the contexts will simply be null.)  The line numbers on the hunks
     in  the reject file may be different than in the patch file: they reflect
     the approximate location patch thinks the failed hunks belong in the  new
     file rather than the old one.

     As each hunk is completed, you will be told whether the hunk succeeded or
     failed, and which line (in the new file) patch thought the hunk should go
     on.  If this is different from the line number specified in the diff  you
     will be told the offset.  A single large offset MAY be an indication that
     a hunk was installed in the wrong place.  You will also be told if a fuzz
     factor  was  used  to  make  the  match, in which case you should also be
     slightly suspicious.

     If no original file is specified on the command line, patch will  try  to
     figure out from the leading garbage what the name of the file to edit is.
     In the header of a  context  diff,  the  filename  is  found  from  lines
     beginning  with ``***'' or ``---'', with the shortest name of an existing
     file winning.  Only context diffs have lines like that, but if  there  is
     an  ``Index:''   line  in  the leading garbage, patch will try to use the
     filename from that line.  The context diff header takes  precedence  over
     an  Index line.  If no filename can be intuited from the leading garbage,
     you will be asked for the name of the file to patch.

     If the original file cannot be found or is read-only, but a suitable SCCS
     or RCS file is handy, patch will attempt to get or check out the file.

     Additionally, if the leading garbage contains a ``Prereq: '' line,  patch
     will  take the first word from the prerequisites line (normally a version
     number) and check the input file to see if that word can  be  found.   If
     not, patch will ask for confirmation before proceeding.

     The upshot of all this is that you should be able to say, while in a news
     interface, the following:

             | patch -d /usr/src/local/blurfl

     and patch a file in  the  blurfl  directory  directly  from  the  article
     containing the patch.


                                    LOCAL                                    2



PATCH(1)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   PATCH(1)


     If the patch file contains more than one patch, patch will try  to  apply
     each  of  them  as  if  they came from separate patch files.  This means,
     among other things, that it is assumed that the name of the file to patch
     must  be  determined  for  each diff listing, and that the garbage before
     each diff listing  will  be  examined  for  interesting  things  such  as
     filenames  and  revision  level,  as  mentioned previously.  You can give
     switches (and another original file name) for the second  and  subsequent
     patches  by  separating  the corresponding argument lists by a `+'.  (The
     argument list for a second or subsequent patch  may  not  specify  a  new
     patch file, however.)

     Patch recognizes the following switches:

     -b   causes the next argument to be interpreted as the backup  extension,
          to be used in place of ``.orig'' or ``~''.

     -B   causes the next argument to be interpreted as a prefix to the backup
          file  name.  If this argument is specified any argument from -b will
          be ignored.

     -c   forces patch to interpret the patch file as a context diff.

     -d   causes patch to interpret the next argument as a directory,  and  cd
          to it before doing anything else.

     -D   causes patch to use the "#ifdef...#endif" construct to mark changes.
          The  argument  following will be used as the differentiating symbol.
          Note that, unlike the C compiler, there must be a space between  the
          -D and the argument.

     -e   forces patch to interpret the patch file as an ed script.

     -E   causes patch to remove output files that are empty after the patches
          have been applied.

     -f   forces patch to assume that the user knows exactly what he or she is
          doing, and to not ask any questions.  It assumes the following: skip
          patches for which a file to patch can't be found; patch  files  even
          though  they  have the wrong version for the ``Prereq:'' line in the
          patch; and assume that patches are not reversed even  if  they  look
          like they are.  This option does not suppress commentary; use -s for
          that.

     -t   similar to -f, in that  it  suppresses  questions,  but  makes  some
          different assumptions:  skip patches for which a file to patch can't
          be found (the same as -f); skip patches for which the file  has  the
          wrong version for the ``Prereq:'' line in the patch; and assume that
          patches are reversed if they look like they are.

     -F<number>
          sets the maximum fuzz factor.  This switch only applies  to  context
          diffs,  and  causes patch to ignore up to that many lines in looking
          for places to install a  hunk.   Note  that  a  larger  fuzz  factor
          increases the odds of a faulty patch.  The default fuzz factor is 2,
          and it may not be set to more than the number of lines of context in
          the context diff, ordinarily 3.

     -l   causes the pattern matching to be done loosely, in case the tabs and
          spaces  have  been  munged  in  your  input  file.   Any sequence of
          whitespace in the pattern line will match any sequence in the  input
          file.  Normal characters must still match exactly.  Each line of the
          context must still match a line in the input file.

     -n   forces patch to interpret the patch file as a normal diff.

     -N   causes patch to ignore  patches  that  it  thinks  are  reversed  or
          already applied.  See also -R .

     -o   causes the next argument to be interpreted as the output file name.

     -p<number>
          sets the pathname strip count, which controls how pathnames found in
          the  patch  file  are  treated, in case the you keep your files in a
          different directory than the person who sent  out  the  patch.   The
          strip  count  specifies how many slashes are to be stripped from the
          front of the pathname.  (Any intervening  directory  names  also  go
          away.)  For example, supposing the filename in the patch file was

                  /u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

          setting -p or -p0 gives the entire pathname unmodified, -p1 gives

                  u/howard/src/blurfl/blurfl.c

          without the leading slash, -p4 gives

                  blurfl/blurfl.c

          and not specifying -p at all just gives you "blurfl.c",  unless  all
          of  the  directories in the leading path (u/howard/src/blurfl) exist
          and that path is relative, in which case you get the entire pathname
          unmodified.   Whatever  you  end up with is looked for either in the
          current directory, or the directory specified by the -d switch.

     -r   causes the next argument to be interpreted as the reject file name.

     -R   tells patch that this patch was created with the old and  new  files
          swapped.   (Yes,  I'm  afraid  that  does happen occasionally, human
          nature being what it is.)  Patch will  attempt  to  swap  each  hunk


                                    LOCAL                                    4



PATCH(1)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   PATCH(1)


          around before applying it.  Rejects will come  out  in  the  swapped
          format.   The  -R  switch will not work with ed diff scripts because
          there  is  too  little  information  to  reconstruct   the   reverse
          operation.

          If the first hunk of a patch fails, patch will reverse the  hunk  to
          see  if it can be applied that way.  If it can, you will be asked if
          you want to have the -R switch set.  If it  can't,  the  patch  will
          continue to be applied normally.  (Note: this method cannot detect a
          reversed patch if it is a normal diff and if the first command is an
          append  (i.e.  it  should  have  been a delete) since appends always
          succeed, due to the fact that a null context  will  match  anywhere.
          Luckily,  most  patches add or change lines rather than delete them,
          so most reversed normal diffs will begin with a delete,  which  will
          fail, triggering the heuristic.)

     -s   makes patch do its work silently, unless an error occurs.

     -S   causes patch to ignore this patch from the patch file, but  continue
          on looking for the next patch in the file.  Thus

                  patch -S + -S + <patchfile

          will ignore the first and second of three patches.

     -u   forces patch to interpret the patch file as a unified  context  diff
          (a unidiff).

     -v   causes patch to print out its revision header and patch level.

     -V   causes the next argument to be interpreted as a method for  creating
          backup  file  names.   The type of backups made can also be given in
          the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable,  which  is  overridden  by
          this  option.   The  -B  option  overrides  this option, causing the
          prefix to always be used for making backup file names.  The value of
          the  VERSION_CONTROL environment variable and the argument to the -V
          option are like the GNU Emacs `version-control' variable; they  also
          recognize  synonyms that are more descriptive.  The valid values are
          (unique abbreviations are accepted):

     `t' or `numbered'
          Always make numbered backups.

     `nil' or `existing'
          Make numbered backups  of  files  that  already  have  them,  simple
          backups of the others.  This is the default.

     `never' or `simple'
          Always make simple backups.

NOTES FOR PATCH SENDERS
     There are several things you should bear in mind if you are going  to  be
     sending  out  patches.   First,  you  can  save  people a lot of grief by
     keeping a patchlevel.h file which is patched to increment the patch level
     as  the  first diff in the patch file you send out.  If you put a Prereq:
     line in with the patch, it won't let them  apply  patches  out  of  order
     without  some  warning.  Second, make sure you've specified the filenames
     right, either in a context diff header, or with an Index: line.   If  you
     are  patching something in a subdirectory, be sure to tell the patch user
     to specify a -p switch as needed.   Third,  you  can  create  a  file  by
     sending  out  a  diff  that  compares a null file to the file you want to
     create.  This will only work if the file you want to create doesn't exist
     already  in  the  target  directory.   Fourth,  take care not to send out
     reversed patches, since it  makes  people  wonder  whether  they  already
     applied the patch.  Fifth, while you may be able to get away with putting
     582 diff listings into one file, it is probably wiser  to  group  related
     patches into separate files in case something goes haywire.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Too many to list here, but generally indicative that patch couldn't parse
     your patch file.





                                    LOCAL                                    6



PATCH(1)                  Minix Programmer's Manual                   PATCH(1)


     The message ``Hmm...'' indicates that there is unprocessed  text  in  the
     patch  file  and  that  patch  is attempting to intuit whether there is a
     patch in that text and, if so, what kind of patch it is.

     Patch will exit with a non-zero status if any reject files were  created.
     When  applying  a  set of patches in a loop it behooves you to check this
     exit status so you don't apply a later patch to a partially patched file.

CAVEATS
     Patch cannot tell if the line numbers are off in an ed  script,  and  can
     only  detect bad line numbers in a normal diff when it finds a ``change''
     or a ``delete'' command.  A context diff using fuzz factor 3 may have the
     same  problem.   Until  a  suitable  interactive  interface is added, you
     should probably do a context diff in these cases to see  if  the  changes
     made  sense.   Of  course,  compiling  without  errors  is  a pretty good
     indication that the patch worked, but not always.

     Patch usually produces the correct results, even when it has to do a  lot
     of guessing.  However, the results are guaranteed to be correct only when
     the patch is applied to exactly the same version of  the  file  that  the
     patch was generated from.

BUGS
     Could be smarter about partial matches, excessively deviant  offsets  and
     swapped code, but that would take an extra pass.

     If code has been duplicated (for instance with #ifdef OLDCODE  ...  #else
     ...   #endif),  patch  is incapable of patching both versions, and, if it
     works at all, will likely patch the wrong  one,  and  tell  you  that  it
     succeeded to boot.

     If you apply a patch you've already applied, patch will  think  it  is  a
     reversed patch, and offer to un-apply the patch.  This could be construed
     as a feature.
