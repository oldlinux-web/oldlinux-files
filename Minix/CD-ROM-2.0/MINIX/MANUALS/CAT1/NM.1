NAME
     nm - print name list

SYNOPSIS
     nm [-dgnopru] [file] ...

OPTIONS

     -d   Print the offsets in decimal instead of in hex

     -g   Print only external symbols

     -n   Sort numerically rather than alphabetically

     -o   Prepend file name to each line rather than only once

     -p   Do not sort, print in symbol-table order

     -r   Sort in reverse order

     -u   Print only undefined symbols

EXAMPLES

     nm -n a.out         # Print all symbols in numerical order

     nm -dg a.out        # Print globals alphabetically in decimal

DESCRIPTION

     Nm prints the symbol table of executable files when it is available.   If
     no  file is given, the symbols in a.out are used. The format of the table
     is somewhat compatible with the one produced  by asld when used with  the
     -s  option.  The  symbol  table  can be added with ast. Assembly language
     files do not have symbol tables.
