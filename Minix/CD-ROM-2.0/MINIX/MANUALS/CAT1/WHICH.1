NAME
     which - examine $PATH to see which file will be executed

SYNOPSIS
     which name

EXAMPLES

     which a.out         # Tells which a.out will be executed

DESCRIPTION

     The $PATH shell variable controls the MINIX search rules.  If  a  command
     a.out  is  given, the shell first tries to find an executable file in the
     working directory. If that fails, it looks in various system directories,
     such  as  /bin  and /usr/bin. The which command makes the same search and
     gives the absolute path of the program that will be chosen,  followed  by
     other occurrences of the file name along the path.
