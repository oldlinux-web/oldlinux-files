NAME
     yes - an endless stream of the same word

SYNOPSIS
     yes [answer]

EXAMPLES

     yes | script        # Answer yes to all questions from the script

DESCRIPTION

     Yes sends out an endless stream of y's, each on one line.  One uses it to
     automatically  say  "yes"  to  all  questions a command may ask.  This is
     useful for commands that ask too many "Are  you  sure?"  questions.   The
     optional  argument makes yes use answer as the word to print instead of a
     single y character.
