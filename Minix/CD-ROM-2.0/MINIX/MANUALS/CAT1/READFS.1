NAME
     readfs - read a MINIX file system

SYNOPSIS
     readfs [-il] block_special [dir]

     -i   Give information about the file, but do not extract files

     -l   List the files extracted on standard output

DESCRIPTION

     Readfs reads a diskette containing a MINIX file system.  It  can  extract
     all  the  files  from  it,  give  a  listing of them, or both.  The files
     extracted can be put in  a  user-specified  directory  (default:  current
     directory).    If   subdirectories  are  needed,  they  will  be  created
     automatically.
