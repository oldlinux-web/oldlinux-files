NAME
     btoa - binary to ascii conversion

SYNOPSIS
     btoa [-adhor] [infile] [outfile]

OPTIONS

     -a   Decode, rather than encode, the file

     -d   Extracts repair file from diagnosis file

     -h   Help menu is displayed giving the options

     -o   The obsolete algorithm is used for backward compatibility

     -r   Repair a damaged file

EXAMPLES

     btoa <a.out >a.btoa # Convert a.out to ASCII

     btoa -a <a.btoa >a.out
                         # Reverse the above

DESCRIPTION

     Btoa is a filter that converts a binary file to  ascii  for  transmission
     over a telephone line.  If two file names are provided, the first in used
     for input and the second for output.  If only one is provided, it is used
     as  the input file.  The program is a functionally similar alternative to
     uue/uud, but the encoding is completely different.  Since both  of  these
     are  widely  used,  both  have  been  provided  with  MINIX.  The file is
     expanded about 25 percent in the process.
