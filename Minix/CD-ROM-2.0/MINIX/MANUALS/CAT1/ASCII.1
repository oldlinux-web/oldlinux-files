NAME
     ascii - strip all the pure ASCII lines from a file

SYNOPSIS
     ascii [-n] [file]

OPTIONS

EXAMPLES

DESCRIPTION

     Sometimes a file contains some nonASCII characters that are in  the  way.
     This  program  allows  the  lines  containing only ASCII characters to be
     grepped from the file. With the -n flag, the nonASCII lines are  grepped.
     No  matter  whether  the flag is used or not, the program returns an exit
     status of true if the file is pure ASCII, and false otherwise.
