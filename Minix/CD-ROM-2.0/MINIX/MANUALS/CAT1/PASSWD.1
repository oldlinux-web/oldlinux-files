NAME
     passwd, chfn, chsh - change a login password, full name or shell

SYNOPSIS
     passwd [user]
     chfn [user] fullname
     chfn [user] shell

EXAMPLES

     passwd              # Change current user's password

     passwd ast          # Change ast's password (super-user only)

     chsh /usr/bin/mail  # For those who only read mail

     chfn 'Jane Doe'     # Current user is Jane Doe

DESCRIPTION

     Passwd is used to change your password.  It prompts for the old  and  new
     passwords.  It asks for the new password twice, to reduce the effect of a
     typing error.  Chfn changes the full name (GECOS field) in  the  password
     file.  Chsh changes your login shell.  Do not forget to copy the modified
     password file back to the root file system, or the changes will  be  lost
     when the system is rebooted.
