NAME
     mv - move or rename a file

SYNOPSIS
     mv [-ifsmvx] file1 file2
     mv [-ifsvx] file ... directory

OPTIONS

     -i   Prompt before removing existing files

     -f   Do not prompt before removing existing files

     -s   Do not clear any mode bits if owner can't be set

     -m   Merge directory trees

     -v   Tell what mv is doing

     -x   Do not cross device boundaries

EXAMPLES

     mv oldname newname  # Move oldname to newname

     mv file1 file2 /user/ast
                         # Move two files to /user/ast

DESCRIPTION

     Mv moves one or more files from one place in the file system to  another.
     If  the  old  path  and  new  path  are on the same device, it is done by
     renaming otherwise by copying. If you're not  superuser,  the  copy  will
     destroy  the  file's owner, group and setuid/setgid bits.  mv will prompt
     before removing non-writable files if stdin is a terminal or the -i  flag
     was specified.
