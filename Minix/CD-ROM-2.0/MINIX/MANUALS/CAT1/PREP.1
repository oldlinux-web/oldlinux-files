DESCRIPTION

     Prep strips off most of the troff commands from  a  text  file  and  then
     outputs  all the words, one word per line, in the order they occur in the
     file.  This file can then be sorted and compared to a  dictionary  (as  a
     spelling checker), or used for statistical analyses.
