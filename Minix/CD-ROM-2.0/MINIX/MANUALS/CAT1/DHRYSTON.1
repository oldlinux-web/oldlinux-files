NAME
     dhrystone - integer benchmark

SYNOPSIS
     dhrystone

EXAMPLES

     dhrystone           # Run the dhrystone benchmark

DESCRIPTION

     Many years ago, a floating-point benchmark called whetstone  was  popular
     for benchmarking FORTRAN programs.  Nowadays, an integer benchmark called
     dhrystone is widely used for benchmarking UNIX systems.  This is it.   Be
     warned,   however,  that  dhrystone  is  entirely  CPU  bound,  and  goes
     blindingly fast on machines with high-speed caches.  Although this  is  a
     good  measure  for  programs  that spend most of their time in some inner
     loop, it is a poor benchmark for I/O bound applications.
