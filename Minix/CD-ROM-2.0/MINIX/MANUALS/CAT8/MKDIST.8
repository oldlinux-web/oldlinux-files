NAME
     mkdist - make a Minix distribution

SYNOPSIS
     mkdist

DESCRIPTION
     Mkdist makes a Minix distribution on floppies.  Run the command  as  root
     and   follow  the  instructions.   It  will  make  one  or  two  bootable
     installation floppies and a  compressed  tar  file  of  /usr  on  several
     floppies using vol(1).

     The result can be installed on another system as described  in  usage(8),
     except  that all of /usr is saved on one set of floppies instead of being
     nicely split in binary and source packages.

SEE ALSO
     tar(1), compress(1), vol(1), usage(8).

NOTES
     Also very useful for making backups.
