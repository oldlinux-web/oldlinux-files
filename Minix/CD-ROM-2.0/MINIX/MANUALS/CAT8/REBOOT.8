NAME
     reboot - reboot the system immediately

SYNOPSIS
     reboot [-f]

DESCRIPTION
     Reboot can be used to reboot the system after installing  a  new  kernel.
     It  does not inform the users, but does log it's actions in /usr/adm/wtmp
     and /usr/adm/authlog.  The system is then  rebooted  with  the  reboot(2)
     systemcall.

     If the -f flag is not given then all processes are sent terminate signals
     to give them a chance to die peacefully before the reboot() call.

     If the wtmp file exists, reboot logs itself as if  it  were  a  shutdown.
     This  is  done  to  prevent  last(1)  from  talking about system-crashes.
     Reboot is registered as is in the authlog file.

     Reboot can only be executed by the super-user.  Any other caller will  be
     refused, either by reboot(8) or by reboot(2).

SEE ALSO
     reboot(2), shutdown(8), halt(8), boot(8).

BUGS
     The error message's given by reboot are not  always  useful.   There  are
     several routines that can fail, but which are not fatal for the program.
