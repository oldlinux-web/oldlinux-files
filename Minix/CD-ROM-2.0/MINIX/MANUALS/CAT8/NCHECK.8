NAME
     ncheck - i-node to name converter

SYNOPSIS
     ncheck [-i numbers] [-a] [-s] file_system

OPTIONS

     -a   List all files, even . and ..

     -i   Followed by a list of i-nodes

     -s   List only special and setuid files

EXAMPLES

     ncheck - /dev/fd0   # List everything on /dev/fd0

     ncheck -i 10,15 /dev/fd0
                         # List i-nodes 10 and 15 on /dev/fd0

DESCRIPTION

     Sometimes one knows about an i-node number and wants  to  find  the  file
     name that goes with it.  This program makes that mapping.  The default is
     to list everything on the device, but the -i flag restricts the  list  to
     specified  i-nodes  and  the  -s  flag  restricts it to special files and
     setuid files (to look for possible security violations).
