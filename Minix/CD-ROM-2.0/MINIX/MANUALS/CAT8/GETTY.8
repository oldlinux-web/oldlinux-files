NAME
     getty - system login banner

SYNOPSIS
     getty [banner ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Getty displays a system identification banner, reads  a  user  name  from
     standard input and executes login with that name as argument.

     Getty uses its arguments separated by spaces  as  a  login  banner.   The
     character  sequences \n, \s and \t are printed as newline, space and tab.
     Any other \x prints that x.  The character sequences %s, %n, etc. produce
     the same output as uname -s, uname -n, etc.  The default banner is

          %s\s\sRelease\s%r\sVersion\s%v\n\n%n\slogin:\s

     The only other useful functionality offered by getty is that  it  can  be
     suspended  by  signal  SIGUSR1  and  restarted by SIGUSR2.  This allows a
     program such as modem(1) to temporarily claim a dialin line for dialout.

SEE ALSO
     modem(1), ttytab(5), init(8).

BUGS
     Getty should be taught about modems and modem lines.  The signal trick is
     an awful hack.
