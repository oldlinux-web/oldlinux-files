NAME
     init - grandparent of all processes

DESCRIPTION
     The first program started by Minix is init.   The  actions  performed  by
     init can be summarized by this pseudo shell program:

          # Open 0, 1, 2.
          exec </dev/null >/dev/log 2>&1

          # Run the system initialization script.
          sh /etc/rc $bootopts

          >/etc/utmp
          echo reboot >>/usr/adm/wtmp

          while :; do
                  # Wait for a process to exit, but don't always block.
                  wait

                  # Record logout.  (Not in this dumb way, of course.)
                  if "pid is in my tables" $pid
                  then
                          echo "logout $pid" >/etc/utmp
                          echo "logout $pid" >>/usr/adm/wtmp
                  fi

                  # Start a new session.
                  while read line type getty init
                  do
                          if idle $line
                          then
                                  $init ... <$tty >$tty
                                  $getty <$tty >$tty 2>&1 &
                                  pid=$!
                                  "add pid to tables" $pid
                                  echo "login $line $pid" >/etc/utmp
                                  echo "login $line $pid" >>/usr/adm/wtmp
                          fi
                  done < /dev/ttytab
          done

     The first action of init is to run /etc/rc to initialize  the  system  as
     described  in boot(8).  Init then enters its main loop where it waits for
     processes to exit, and starts processes on each  enabled  terminal  line.
     The  file /etc/ttytab contains a list of terminal devices, their terminal
     types, the program to execute on them to  allow  one  to  login  (usually
     getty(8)),  and  the  program  to  execute  first  to initialize the line
     (usually stty(1)).  These fields may be left out to indicate that a  line
     is  disabled  or  that initialization is not necessary.  The commands are

INIT(8)                   Minix Programmer's Manual                    INIT(8)


     searched using the path /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin.

     Init accepts several signals that must be sent to process id 1.   (It  is
     the first process, so natually its process id is 1.)  The signals are:

     SIGHUP
          When receiving a hangup signal, init will forget  about  errors  and
          rescan  ttytab  for  processes  to  execute.   Init normally rescans
          ttytab each time it feels the need to  respawn  a  process,  so  the
          hangup  signal is only needed if a line has been shut down, or after
          a terminate signal.  Note that after turning a  line  off  you  will
          have to kill the process running on that line manually, init doesn't
          do that for you.

     SIGTERM
          Normally sent by programs that halt or reboot Minix.  Causes init to
          stop spawning new processes.

     SIGABRT
          Sent by the keyboard driver when the CTRL-ALT-DEL key combination is
          typed.   Causes  init  to  run the shutdown command.  A second abort
          signal makes init halt the system directly with a system call.   The
          keyboard  driver  halts  the system, without a sync, after the third
          CTRL-ALT-DEL.

  Minix vs. Minix-vmd
     There are a few differences between standard Minix and Minix-vmd  on  how
     init  is  run.   The  /etc/rc  file is executed under standard Minix with
     input connected to  /dev/console,  but  under  Minix-vmd  this  is  still
     /dev/null.  This means that under Minix-vmd processes must be reconnected
     to /dev/console with the intr program  if  they  need  user  interaction.
     Minix-vmd  passes  the  value  of  the bootopts boot variable to /etc/rc.
     Standard Minix does not.

FILES

     /etc/ttytab              List of terminals devices.

     /etc/utmp                List of currently logged in users.

     /usr/adm/wtmp            Login/logout history.
