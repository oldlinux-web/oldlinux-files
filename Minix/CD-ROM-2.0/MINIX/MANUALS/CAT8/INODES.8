NAME
     inodes - print i-node information

SYNOPSIS
     inodes

EXAMPLES

     inodes              # Print information about file names typed in

     cd /dev; ls | inodes
                         # Print information about the special files

DESCRIPTION

     Inodes expects a list of file names on stdin, one  file  name  per  line.
     For each file named, the file type, mode, uid, gid, checksum, length, and
     name is printed.  The checksum is the same as used by crc.  This  program
     provides  a  way  to see the sizes of the block special files in /dev, as
     shown in the second example above.
