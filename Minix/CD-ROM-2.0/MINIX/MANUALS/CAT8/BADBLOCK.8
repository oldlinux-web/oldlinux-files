NAME
     badblocks - put a list of bad blocks in a file

SYNOPSIS
     badblocks block_special [block] ...

EXAMPLES

     badblocks /dev/hd1
                         # Handle bad blocks on /dev/hd1

     badblocks /dev/hd3 310 570 1680

DESCRIPTION

     If a device contains bad sectors,  it  is  important  to  not  have  them
     allocated  to important files.  This program makes it possible to collect
     up to 7 bad blocks into a dummy file, so they will not be allocated for a
     'real'  file.  When  the  program  starts  up,  it asks for a list of bad
     blocks, unless they are provided as arguments.  Then it  creates  a  file
     whose name is of the form .Bad_xxxxx, where xxxxx is a pid.
