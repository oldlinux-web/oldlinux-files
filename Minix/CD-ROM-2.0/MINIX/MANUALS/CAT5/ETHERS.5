NAME
     ethers - ethernet address to hostname database

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/ethers

DESCRIPTION
     The ethers database translates ethernet addresses to hostnames for use by
     the RARP daemon (see rarpd(8).)  /etc/ethers may look like this:

          0:0:c0:a:77:23      darask
          0:0:c0:a:68:ce      burask

     The six octet ethernet numbers must be entered as shown  above,  the  hex
     constants  must  use  lowercase  letters  and may not have leading zeros.
     Comments are marked with '#'.

     See rarpd(8) on why you shouldn't list Sun hosts in this file.
