NAME
     dir - directory layout

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <sys/dir.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The directories of the V1 and V2 file systems are arrays of the following
     structure defined in <sys/dir.h>:

     struct direct {
          ino_t          d_ino;         /* I-node number */
          char           d_name[14];    /* Name of up to 14 characters */
     };

     The d_ino field is the inode number of the file named by  d_name.   D_ino
     is  zero  if the directory slot isn't allocated.  This number is the same
     as st_ino returned by stat(2) unless the entry is mounted on.  D_name  is
     the  name of up to 14 characters, null-terminated only if less then 14 in
     length.  Any character other than null or '/' is allowed.

     See directory(3) for a portable  way  to  access  directories,  Minix  is
     probably the last system with these old V7 format directories.
