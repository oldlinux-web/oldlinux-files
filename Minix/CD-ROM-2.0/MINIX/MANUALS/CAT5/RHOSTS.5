NAME
     rhosts, hosts.equiv - trusted remote users or hosts

SYNOPSIS
     ~user/.rhosts
     /etc/hosts.equiv

DESCRIPTION
     The per user .rhosts and the per system hosts.equiv files can be used  to
     allow  users  to  use rlogin or rsh without a password.  The remote login
     services first check the system wide /etc/hosts.equiv file and  then  the
     ~user/.rhosts  of  the intended user.  Both files contain lines of one of
     two forms:

          host
          host ruser

     The first form tells that any user from host is allowed to login to  this
     system  under  the  same name.  The second form allows ruser from host to
     login.

     The .rhosts file is checked to be owned by user or  root,  and  only  its
     owner may be able to write it.

SEE ALSO
     rlogin(1), rsh(1).

NOTES
     Minix has no restrictions on becoming super-user remotely.  Other systems
     usually do.
