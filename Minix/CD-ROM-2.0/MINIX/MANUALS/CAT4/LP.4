NAME
     lp - line printer

DESCRIPTION
     The lp device refers to the line printer attached to the  parallel  port.
     Any  byte  written  to this device is printed.  Only one process may have
     the device open.

     The write (2) call may return with a smaller count  then  the  number  of
     bytes  requested  to  write.   The next write call is then likely to fail
     with the error code EAGAIN if the printer is out of paper, or EIO if  the
     printer is turned off.

FILES

     /dev/lp   Parallel port device.

SEE ALSO
     lp(1).

BUGS
     Only one parallel port is supported.
