NAME
     execve - execute a file

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int execve(const char *name, char *const argv[], char *const envp[])

DESCRIPTION
     Execve transforms the calling  process  into  a  new  process.   The  new
     process is constructed from an ordinary file called the new process file.
     This file is either an executable object file, or a file of data  for  an
     interpreter.   An  executable  object  file  consists  of  an identifying
     header, followed by pages of data representing the initial program (text)
     and  initialized  data  pages.   Additional pages may be specified by the
     header to be initialized with zero data.  See a.out(5).

     An interpreter file begins with a line of the  form  ``#!  interpreter''.
     (Minix-vmd  only.)   When  an  interpreter  file  is execve'd, the system
     execve's the specified interpreter, giving it the name of the  originally
     exec'd  file  as  an  argument and shifting over the rest of the original
     arguments.

     There can be no return from a successful execve because the calling  core
     image  is  lost.   This is the mechanism whereby different process images
     become active.

     The argument argv is a null-terminated array  of  character  pointers  to
     null-terminated character strings.  These strings constitute the argument
     list to be made available to the new process.  By  convention,  at  least
     one argument must be present in this array, and the first element of this
     array should be  the  name  of  the  executed  program  (i.e.,  the  last
     component of name).

     The argument envp is also a null-terminated array of  character  pointers
     to  null-terminated  strings.   These strings pass information to the new
     process that is not directly an argument to the command (see environ(7)).

     Descriptors open in the calling process remain open in the  new  process,
     except  for those for which the close-on-exec flag is set (see close(2)).
     Descriptors that remain open are unaffected by execve.

     Ignored signals remain ignored across an execve,  but  signals  that  are
     caught are reset to their default values.  Blocked signals remain blocked
     regardless of changes to the signal action.  The signal stack is reset to
     be undefined (see sigaction(2) for more information).

     Each process has real user and group IDs and an effective user and  group
     IDs.   The  real ID identifies the person using the system; the effective
     ID determines his access privileges.  Execve changes the  effective  user

     and group ID to the owner of the executed file if the file has the  "set-
     user-ID" or "set-group-ID" modes.  The real user ID is not affected.

     The new process also inherits the following attributes from  the  calling
     process:

          process ID              see getpid(2)
          parent process ID       see getppid(2)
          process group ID        see getpgrp(2)
          access groups           see getgroups(2)
          working directory       see chdir(2)
          root directory          see chroot(2)
          control terminal        see tty(4)
          alarm timer             see alarm(2)
          file mode mask          see umask(2)
          signal mask             see sigaction(2), sigprocmask(2)

     When the executed program begins, it is called as follows:

          int main(int argc, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);

          exit(main(argc, argv, envp));

     where argc is the number of elements in argv (the ``arg count'') and argv
     is the array of character pointers to the arguments themselves.

     Envp is a pointer to an array of strings that constitute the  environment
     of  the  process.   A  pointer to this array is also stored in the global
     variable ``environ''.  Each string consists of a  name,  an  "=",  and  a
     null-terminated  value.   The  array  of pointers is terminated by a null
     pointer.  The shell sh(1) passes an environment  entry  for  each  global
     shell  variable  defined  when the program is called.  See environ(7) for
     some conventionally used names.

RETURN VALUE
     If execve returns to the calling  process  an  error  has  occurred;  the
     return  value  will  be  -1 and the global variable errno will contain an
     error code.

ERRORS
     Execve will fail and return to the calling process if one or more of  the
     following are true:

     [ENOTDIR]      A component of the path prefix is not a directory.

     [ENAMETOOLONG] The path name exceeds PATH_MAX characters.

     [ENOENT]       The new process file does not exist.

     [ELOOP]        Too many symbolic links were  encountered  in  translating
                    the pathname.  (Minix-vmd)

     [EACCES]       Search permission is denied for a component  of  the  path
                    prefix.

     [EACCES]       The new process file is not an ordinary file.

     [EACCES]       The new process file mode denies execute permission.

     [ENOEXEC]      The  new  process  file   has   the   appropriate   access
                    permission, but has an invalid magic number in its header.

     [ENOMEM]       The new process requires more  (virtual)  memory  than  is
                    currently available.

     [E2BIG]        The number of bytes in the new process's argument list  is
                    larger  than  the system-imposed limit ARG_MAX.  The limit
                    in the system as released is 4096 bytes for 16-bit  Minix,
                    16384 bytes for 32-bit Minix, and unlimited for Minix-vmd.

     [EFAULT]       Path, argv, or envp point to an illegal address.

     [EIO]          An I/O error occurred while reading from the file system.

CAVEATS
     If a program is setuid to a non-super-user, but is executed when the real
     uid  is ``root'', then the program has some of the powers of a super-user
     as well.
