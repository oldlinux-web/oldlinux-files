NAME
     mount, umount - mount or umount a file system

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>
     #include <sys/mount.h>

     int mount(char *special, char *name, int flag)
     int umount(char *name)

DESCRIPTION
     Mount() tells the system that the file system special is to be mounted on
     the file name, effectively overlaying name with the file tree on special.
     Name may of any type, except that if the root of special is a  directory,
     then  name  must  also  be  a directory.  Special must be a block special
     file, except for loopback mounts.  For loopback mounts a normal  file  or
     directory  is  used  for  special,  which  must  be seen as the root of a
     virtual device.  Flag is 0 for a read-write mount, 1 for read-only.

     Umount() removes the connection between a device and a mount point,  name
     may  refer  to either of them.  If more than one device is mounted on the
     same mount point then unmounting at the  mount  point  removes  the  last
     mounted  device,  unmounting a device removes precisely that device.  The
     unmount will only succeed if none of the files on the device are in use.

     Both calls may only be executed by the super-user.
