NAME
     getgid, getegid - get group identity

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/types.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

     gid_t getgid(void)
     gid_t getegid(void)

DESCRIPTION
     Getgid returns the real group ID of  the  current  process,  getegid  the
     effective group ID.

     The real group ID is specified at login time.

     The effective group ID  is  more  transient,  and  determines  additional
     access  permission during execution of a ``set-group-ID'' process, and it
     is for such processes that getgid is most useful.

SEE ALSO
     getuid(2), setgid(2).
