NAME
     stdio - standard buffered input/output package

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     FILE *stdin;
     FILE *stdout;
     FILE *stderr;

DESCRIPTION
     The functions  in  the  standard  I/O  library  constitute  a  user-level
     buffering  scheme.  The in-line macros getc and putc(3) handle characters
     quickly.  The higher level routines gets, fgets,  scanf,  fscanf,  fread,
     puts,  fputs,  printf, fprintf, fwrite all use getc and putc; they can be
     freely intermixed.

     A file with associated buffering is called a stream, and is  declared  to
     be   a  pointer  to  a  defined  type  FILE.   Fopen(3)  creates  certain
     descriptive data for a stream and returns  a  pointer  to  designate  the
     stream  in  all  further  transactions.   There  are  three normally open
     streams  with  constant  pointers  declared  in  the  include  file   and
     associated with the standard open files:

     stdin     standard input file
     stdout    standard output file
     stderr    standard error file

     A constant `pointer' NULL (0) designates no stream at all.

     An integer constant EOF (-1) is returned upon end of  file  or  error  by
     integer functions that deal with streams.

     Any routine that uses the standard input/output package must include  the
     header  file <stdio.h> of pertinent macro definitions.  The functions and
     constants mentioned in the standard I/O manual pages are declared in  the
     include  file  and  need  no further declaration.  The constants, and the
     following `functions' are implemented as macros; redeclaration  of  these
     names is perilous:  clearerr, getc, getchar, putc, putchar, feof, ferror,
     fileno.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The value EOF is returned uniformly to indicate that a FILE  pointer  has
     not  been initialized with fopen, input (output) has been attempted on an
     output (input) stream, or a FILE pointer designates corrupt or  otherwise
     unintelligible FILE data.

     For purposes of efficiency, this implementation of the  standard  library
     has  been  changed  to  line  buffer  output to a terminal by default and
     attempts to do this transparently  by  flushing  the  output  whenever  a
     read(2)  from  the  standard  input  is necessary.  This is almost always
     transparent, but may cause confusion or malfunctioning of programs  which
     use  standard  i/o  routines  but use read(2) themselves to read from the
     standard input.

     In cases where a large amount of computation is done after printing  part
     of  a  line  on  an  output  terminal,  it  is necessary to fflush(3) the
     standard output before going off and computing so that  the  output  will
     appear.

BUGS
     The standard buffered functions do not interact well with  certain  other
     library and system functions, especially fork and abort.
