NAME
     getcwd - get current working directory pathname

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     char *getcwd(char *pathname, size_t len)

DESCRIPTION
     Getcwd copies the absolute pathname of the current working  directory  to
     pathname  and  returns  a pointer to the result.  Pathname is a character
     array of length len.

DIAGNOSTICS
     Getcwd returns a null pointer and sets errno if  an  error  occurs.   The
     error  will  reflect the system call errors that may occur if the path to
     the current directory is searched upwards to  the  root  directory.   The
     error ERANGE is returned if the result does not fit within len bytes.
