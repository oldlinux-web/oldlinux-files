NAME
     putc, putchar, fputc, putw - put character or word on a stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int putc(int c, FILE *stream)
     int putchar(int c)
     int fputc(int c, FILE *stream)
     int putw(int w, FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Putc appends the character c to the named output stream.  It returns  the
     character written.

     Putchar(c) is defined as putc(c, stdout).

     Fputc behaves like putc, but is a genuine function rather than a macro.

     Putw appends word (that is, int) w to the output stream.  It returns  the
     word  written.   Putw neither assumes nor causes special alignment in the
     file.

SEE ALSO
     fopen(3), fclose(3), getc(3), puts(3), printf(3), fread(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     These functions return the constant EOF upon error.  Since this is a good
     integer, ferror(3) should be used to detect putw errors.

BUGS
     Because it is implemented as a macro, putc treats a stream argument  with
     side  effects  improperly.   In  particular `putc(c, *f++);' doesn't work
     sensibly.

     Errors can occur long after the call to putc.
