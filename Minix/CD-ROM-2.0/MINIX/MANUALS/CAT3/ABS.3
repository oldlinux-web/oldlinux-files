NAME
     abs - integer absolute value

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     int abs(int i)

DESCRIPTION
     Abs returns the absolute value of its integer operand.

SEE ALSO
     floor(3).

BUGS
     Applying the abs function to the most negative integer generates a result
     which  is  the  most  negative integer.  That is, abs(0x80000000) returns
     0x80000000 as a result on a machine with 32-bit ints.  Using  the  result
     in unsigned computations is sound however.
