NAME
     gets, fgets - get a string from a stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     char *gets(char *s)
     char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Gets reads a string into s from the standard  input  stream  stdin.   The
     string  is terminated by a newline character, which is replaced in s by a
     null character.  Gets returns its argument.

     Fgets reads n-1 characters, or up through a newline character,  whichever
     comes  first, from the stream into the string s.  The last character read
     into s is  followed  by  a  null  character.   Fgets  returns  its  first
     argument.

SEE ALSO
     puts(3), getc(3), scanf(3), fread(3), ferror(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Gets and fgets return the constant pointer  NULL  upon  end  of  file  or
     error.

BUGS
     Gets deletes a newline, fgets keeps it,  all  in  the  name  of  backward
     compatibility.

     Gets is not present in the Minix-vmd C library for reasons that should be
     obvious.  Use fgets instead.
