NAME
     scanf,  fscanf,  sscanf,  vscanf,  vfscanf,  vsscanf  -  formatted  input
     conversion

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdarg.h>

     int scanf(const char *format [, pointer] ...)
     int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format [, pointer] ...)
     int sscanf(const char *s, const char *format [, pointer] ...)
     int vscanf(const char *format, va_list args)
     int vfscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, va_list args)
     int vsscanf(const char *s, const char *format, va_list args)

DESCRIPTION
     Scanf reads from the standard input stream stdin.  Fscanf reads from  the
     named  input  stream.   Sscanf  reads  from the character string s.  Each
     function reads characters, interprets them according  to  a  format,  and
     stores the results in its arguments.  Each expects as arguments a control
     string format, described below, and a set of pointer arguments indicating
     where the converted input should be stored.

     The v*scanf functions can be used to make functions like the first  three
     by using the stdarg(3) method to process the argument pointers.

     The control string usually contains conversion specifications, which  are
     used to direct interpretation of input sequences.  The control string may
     contain:

     1.  Blanks, tabs or newlines, which match optional  white  space  in  the
         input.

     2.  An ordinary character (not %) which must match the next character  of
         the input stream.

     3.  Conversion specifications, consisting of the character %, an optional
         assignment  suppressing  character  *,  an optional numerical maximum
         field width, and a conversion character.

     A conversion specification directs  the  conversion  of  the  next  input
     field;   the  result  is  placed  in  the  variable  pointed  to  by  the
     corresponding argument, unless assignment suppression was indicated by *.
     An input field is defined as a string of non-space characters; it extends
     to the  next  inappropriate  character  or  until  the  field  width,  if
     specified, is exhausted.

     The conversion character indicates the interpretation of the input field;
     the  corresponding pointer argument must usually be of a restricted type.
     The following conversion characters are legal:

     %   a single `%' is expected in the input at this point; no assignment is
         done.

     d   a decimal integer is expected; the corresponding argument  should  be
         an integer pointer.

     o   an octal integer is expected; the corresponding argument should be  a
         integer pointer.

     x   a hexadecimal integer is expected; the corresponding argument  should
         be an integer pointer.

     s   a character string is expected; the corresponding argument should  be
         a  character  pointer pointing to an array of characters large enough
         to accept the string and a terminating `\0',  which  will  be  added.
         The input field is terminated by a space character or a newline.

     c   a character is expected;  the  corresponding  argument  should  be  a
         character   pointer.   The  normal  skip  over  space  characters  is
         suppressed in this case; to read the next  non-space  character,  try
         `%1s'.   If a field width is given, the corresponding argument should
         refer to a character array, and the indicated number of characters is
         read.

     efg a floating point number is expected;  the  next  field  is  converted
         accordingly  and  stored  through  the  corresponding argument, which
         should be a pointer to a float.  The input format for floating  point
         numbers  is an optionally signed string of digits possibly containing
         a decimal point, followed by an optional exponent field consisting of
         an E or e followed by an optionally signed integer.

     [   indicates a string not to be delimited by space characters.  The left
         bracket  is  followed by a set of characters and a right bracket; the
         characters between the brackets define a set of characters making  up
         the  string.  If the first character is not circumflex (^), the input
         field is all characters until the first  character  not  in  the  set
         between  the  brackets; if the first character after the left bracket
         is ^, the input field is all characters  until  the  first  character
         which  is  in  the  remaining set of characters between the brackets.
         The corresponding argument must point to a character array.

     The conversion characters d, o and x may be capitalized or preceded by  l
     to  indicate that a pointer to long rather than to int is in the argument
     list.  Similarly, the conversion characters e, f or g may be  capitalized
     or  preceded  by  l to indicate a pointer to double rather than to float.
     The conversion characters d, o and x may be preceded by h to  indicate  a
     pointer to short rather than to int.

     The scanf  functions  return  the  number  of  successfully  matched  and
     assigned  input  items.   This can be used to decide how many input items
     were found.  The constant EOF is returned upon end of  input;  note  that
     this  is  different  from  0, which means that no conversion was done; if
     conversion was intended, it was frustrated by an inappropriate  character
     in the input.

     For example, the call

               int i; float x; char name[50];
               scanf("%d%f%s", &i, &x, name);

     with the input line

               25   54.32E-1  thompson

     will assign to i the value 25, x the value 5.432, and name  will  contain
     `thompson\0' .  Or,

               int i; float x; char name[50];
               scanf("%2d%f%*d%[1234567890]", &i, &x, name);

     with input

               56789 0123 56a72

     will assign 56 to i, 789.0 to x, skip `0123', and place the string `56\0'
     in name.  The next call to getchar will return `a'.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The scanf functions return EOF on end of input, and  a  short  count  for
     missing or illegal data items.

BUGS
     The success of literal matches and suppressed assignments is not directly
     determinable.
