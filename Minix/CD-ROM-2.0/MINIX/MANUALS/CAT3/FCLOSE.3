NAME
     fclose, fflush - close or flush a stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int fclose(FILE *stream)
     int fflush(FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Fclose causes any buffers for the named stream to  be  emptied,  and  the
     file to be closed.  Buffers allocated by the standard input/output system
     are freed.

     Fclose is performed automatically upon calling exit(3).

     Fflush causes any buffered data for the named output stream to be written
     to that file.  The stream remains open.

SEE ALSO
     close(2), fopen(3), setbuf(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     These routines return EOF if stream is  not  associated  with  an  output
     file, or if buffered data cannot be transferred to that file.
