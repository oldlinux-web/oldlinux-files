NAME
     crypt - one-way password encryption function

SYNOPSIS
     #define _MINIX_SOURCE 1
     #include <unistd.h>

     char *crypt(const char *key, const char *salt)

DESCRIPTION
     The first use of crypt() is to encrypt a password.  Its second use is  to
     authenticate  a  shadow password.  In both cases crypt() calls pwdauth(8)
     to do the real work.

     Crypt() encrypts a password if called with a user typed key, and  a  salt
     whose first two characters are in the set [./0-9A-Za-z].  The result is a
     character string in the [./0-9A-Za-z] alphabet of  which  the  first  two
     characters  are  equal  to  the  salt,  and  the  rest  is  the result of
     encrypting the key and the salt.

     If crypt() is called with a salt that has the form ##user then the key is
     encrypted  and  compared  to the encrypted password of user in the shadow
     password file.  If  they  are  equal  then  crypt()  returns  the  ##user
     argument,  if not then some other string is returned.  This trick assures
     that the normal way to authenticate a password still works:

          if (strcmp(pw->pw_passwd, crypt(key, pw->pw_passwd))) ...

     If key is a null string, and the shadow password is a null string or  the
     salt  is a null string then the result equals salt.  (This is because the
     caller can't tell if a password field is empty  in  the  shadow  password
     file.)

     The key and salt are limited to  1024  bytes  total  including  the  null
     bytes.

SEE ALSO

NOTES
     The result of an encryption  is  returned  in  a  static  array  that  is
     overwritten by each call.  The return value should not be modified.
