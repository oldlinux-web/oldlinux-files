NAME
     abort - generate a fault

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void abort(void)

DESCRIPTION
     Abort executes an instruction which is illegal in user mode.  This causes
     a signal that normally terminates the process with a core dump, which may
     be used for debugging.

SEE ALSO
     sigaction(2), exit(2).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Usually ``abort - core dumped'' from the shell.

BUGS
     The abort() function does not flush standard I/O buffers.  Use fflush(3).
