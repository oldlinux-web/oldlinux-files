NAME
     fseek, ftell, rewind - reposition a stream

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int ptrname)
     long ftell(FILE *stream)
     void rewind(FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Fseek sets the position of the next input  or  output  operation  on  the
     stream.  The new position is at the signed distance offset bytes from the
     beginning, the current position, or the end of  the  file,  according  as
     ptrname has the value 0, 1, or 2.

     Fseek undoes any effects of ungetc(3).

     Ftell returns the current value of the offset relative to  the  beginning
     of the file associated with the named stream.  It is measured in bytes on
     UNIX; on some other systems it is a magic cookie, and the only  foolproof
     way to obtain an offset for fseek.

     Rewind(stream) is equivalent to fseek(stream, 0L, 0).

SEE ALSO
     lseek(2), fopen(3).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Fseek returns -1 for improper seeks, otherwise zero.
