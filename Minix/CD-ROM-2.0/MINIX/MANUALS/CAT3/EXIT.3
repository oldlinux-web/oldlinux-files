NAME
     exit, atexit - terminate a process after flushing any pending output

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     void exit(int status)
     int atexit(void (*func)(void))

DESCRIPTION
     Exit first calls all functions registered by  atexit,  flushes  all  data
     buffered by the Standard I/O library, and finally terminates the process.
     Exit never returns.

     Atexit registers the function func into a table of functions to be called
     on exit.

SEE ALSO
     exit(2).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Atexit returns 0 on success, -1 if malloc cannot allocate more memory for
     the list of registered functions.
