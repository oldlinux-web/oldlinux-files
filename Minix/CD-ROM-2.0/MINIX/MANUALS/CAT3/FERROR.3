NAME
     ferror, feof, clearerr, fileno - stream status inquiries

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int feof(FILE *stream)
     int ferror(FILE *stream)
     int clearerr(FILE *stream)
     int fileno(FILE *stream)

DESCRIPTION
     Feof returns non-zero when end of file is read on the named input stream,
     otherwise  zero.   Unless cleared by clearerr, the end-of-file indication
     lasts until the stream is closed.

     Ferror returns non-zero when an error has occurred reading or writing the
     named  stream,  otherwise  zero.   Unless  cleared by clearerr, the error
     indication lasts until the stream is closed.

     Clearerr resets the error and end-of-file indicators on the named stream.

     Fileno returns the integer file descriptor associated  with  the  stream,
     see open(2).

     Currently all of these functions are implemented as macros;  they  cannot
     be redeclared.
