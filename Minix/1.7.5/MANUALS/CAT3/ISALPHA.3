	  isalpha, isupper, islower, isdigit, isxdigit,	isalnum,
	  isspace, ispunct, isprint, isgraph, iscntrl, isascii -
	  classify characters
SYNTAX
	  #include <ctype.h>
	  int isalpha (c)
	  int c;
	  . . .
DESCRIPTION
	  These	macros classify	character-coded	integer	values by
	  table	lookup.	 Each is a predicate returning nonzero for
	  true,	zero for false.	 Isascii is defined on all integer
	  values; the rest are defined only where isascii is true and
	  on the single	non-ASCII value	EOF [-1	- see stdio(3S)].
	  isalpha	 c is a	letter.
	  isupper	 c is an upper-case letter.
	  islower	 c is a	lower-case letter.
	  isdigit	 c is a	digit [0-9].
	  isxdigit	 c is a	hexadecimal digit [0-9], [A-F] or [a-
			 f].
	  isalnum	 c is an alphanumeric (letter or digit).
	  isspace	 c is a	space, tab, carriage return, new-line,
			 vertical tab, or form-feed.
	  ispunct	 c is a	punctuation character (neither control
			 nor alphanumeric).
	  isprint	 c is a	printing character, code 040 (space)
			 through 0176 (tilde).
	  isgraph	 c is a	printing character, like isprint
			 except	false for space.
	  iscntrl	 c is a	delete character (0177)	or an ordinary
			 control character (less than 040).
	  isascii	 c is an ASCII character, code less than 0200.
DIAGNOSTICS
	  If the argument to any of these macros is not	in the domain
				  
	  of the function, the result is undefined.
