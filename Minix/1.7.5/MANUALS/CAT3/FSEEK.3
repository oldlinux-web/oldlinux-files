NAME
	  fseek, rewind, ftell - reposition a file pointer in a	stream
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  int fseek (stream, offset, ptrname)
	  FILE *stream;
	  long offset;
	  int ptrname;
	  void rewind (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
	  long ftell (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Fseek	sets the position of the next input or output
	  operation on the stream.  The	new position is	at the signed
	  distance offset bytes	from the beginning, from the current
	  position, or from the	end of the file, according as ptrname
	  has the value	0, 1, or 2.
	  Rewind(stream) is equivalent to fseek(stream,	0L, 0),	except
	  that no value	is returned.
	  Fseek	and rewind undo	any effects of ungetc(3S).
	  After	fseek or rewind, the next operation on a file opened
	  for update may be either input or output.
	  Ftell	returns	the offset of the current byte relative	to the
	  beginning of the file	associated with	the named stream.
SEE ALSO
	  lseek(2), fopen(3S), popen(3S), ungetc(3S).
DIAGNOSTICS
	  Fseek	returns	non-zero for improper seeks, otherwise zero.
	  An improper seek can be, for example,	an fseek done on a
	  file that has	not been opened	via fopen; in particular,
	  fseek	may not	be used	on a terminal, or on a file opened via
	  popen(3S).
     WARNING
	  Although on the UNIX system an offset	returned by ftell is
	  measured in bytes, and it is permissible to seek to
	  positions relative to	that offset, portability to non-UNIX
	  systems requires that	an offset be used by fseek directly.
	  Arithmetic may not meaningfully be performed on such an
	  offset, which	is not necessarily measured in bytes.
