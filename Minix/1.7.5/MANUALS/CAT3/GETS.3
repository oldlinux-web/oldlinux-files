NAME
	  gets,	fgets -	get a string from a stream
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  char *gets (s)
	  char *s;
	  char *fgets (s, n, stream)
	  char *s;
	  int n;
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Gets reads characters	from the standard input	stream,	stdin,
	  into the array pointed to by s, until	a new-line character
	  is read or an	end-of-file condition is encountered.  The
	  new-line character is	discarded and the string is terminated
	  with a null character.
	  Fgets	reads characters from the stream into the array
	  pointed to by	s, until n-1 characters	are read, or a new-
	  line character is read and transferred to s, or an end-of-
	  file condition is encountered.  The string is	then
	  terminated with a null character.
SEE ALSO
	  ferror(3S), fopen(3S), fread(3S), getc(3S), scanf(3S).
DIAGNOSTICS
	  If end-of-file is encountered	and no characters have been
	  read,	no characters are transferred to s and a NULL pointer
	  is returned.	If a read error	occurs,	such as	trying to use
	  these	functions on a file that has not been opened for
	  reading, a NULL pointer is returned.	Otherwise s is
	  returned.
