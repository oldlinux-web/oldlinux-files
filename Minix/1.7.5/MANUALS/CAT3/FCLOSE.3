NAME
	  fclose, fflush - close or flush a stream
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  int fclose (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
	  int fflush (stream)
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Fclose causes	any buffered data for the named	stream to be
	  written out, and the stream to be closed.
	  Fclose is performed automatically for	all open files upon
	  calling exit(2).
	  Fflush causes	any buffered data for the named	stream to be
	  written to that file.	 The stream remains open.
DIAGNOSTICS
	  These	functions return 0 for success,	and EOF	if any error
	  (such	as trying to write to a	file that has not been opened
	  for writing) was detected.
SEE ALSO
	  close(2), exit(2), fopen(3S),	setbuf(3S).
