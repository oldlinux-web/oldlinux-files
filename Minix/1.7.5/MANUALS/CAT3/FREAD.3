NAME
	  fread, fwrite	- binary input/output
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  int fread (ptr, size,	nitems,	stream)
	  char *ptr;
	  int size, nitems;
	  FILE *stream;
	  int fwrite (ptr, size, nitems, stream)
	  char *ptr;
	  int size, nitems;
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Fread	copies,	into an	array pointed to by ptr, nitems	items
	  of data from the named input stream, where an	item of	data
	  is a sequence	of bytes (not necessarily terminated by	a null
	  byte)	of length size.	 Fread stops appending bytes if	an
	  end-of-file or error condition is encountered	while reading
	  stream, or if	nitems items have been read.  Fread leaves the
	  file pointer in stream, if defined, pointing to the byte
	  following the	last byte read if there	is one.	 Fread does
	  not change the contents of stream.
	  Fwrite appends at most nitems	items of data from the array
	  pointed to by	ptr to the named output	stream.	 Fwrite	stops
	  appending when it has	appended nitems	items of data or if an
	  error	condition is encountered on stream.  Fwrite does not
	  change the contents of the array pointed to by ptr.
	  The argument size is typically sizeof(*ptr) where the
	  pseudo-function sizeof specifies the length of an item
	  pointed to by	ptr.  If ptr points to a data type other than
	  char it should be cast into a	pointer	to char.
SEE ALSO
	  read(2), write(2), fopen(3S),	getc(3S), gets(3S),
	  printf(3S), putc(3S),	puts(3S), scanf(3S).
DIAGNOSTICS
	  Fread	and fwrite return the number of	items read or written.
	  If size or nitems is non-positive, no	characters are read or
	  written and 0	is returned by both fread and fwrite.
BUGS
	  On the PDP-11	and iAPX286, the number	of bytes transferred
	  is the product of size and nitems, modulo 65536.
