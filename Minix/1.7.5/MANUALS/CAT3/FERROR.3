DESCRIPTION
	  Ferror returns non-zero when an I/O error has	previously
	  occurred reading from	or writing to the named	stream,
	  otherwise zero.
	  Feof returns non-zero	when EOF has previously	been detected
	  reading the named input stream, otherwise zero.
	  Clearerr resets the error indicator and EOF indicator	to
	  zero on the named stream.
	  Fileno returns the integer file descriptor associated	with
	  the named stream; see	open(2).
