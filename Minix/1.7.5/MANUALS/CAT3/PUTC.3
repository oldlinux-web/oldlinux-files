NAME
	  putc,	putchar, fputc,	putw - put character or	word on	a
	  stream
SYNTAX
	  #include <stdio.h>
	  int putc (c, stream)
	  int c;
	  FILE *stream;
	  int putchar (c)
	  int c;
	  int fputc (c,	stream)
	  int c;
	  FILE *stream;
	  int putw (w, stream)
	  int w;
	  FILE *stream;
DESCRIPTION
	  Putc writes the character c onto the output stream (at the
	  position where the file pointer, if defined, is pointing).
	  Putchar(c) is	defined	as putc(c, stdout).  Putc and putchar
	  are macros.
	  Fputc	behaves	like putc, but is a function rather than a
	  macro.  Fputc	runs more slowly than putc, but	it takes less
	  space	per invocation and its name can	be passed as an
	  argument to a	function.
	  Putw writes the word (i.e., integer) w to the	output stream
	  (at the position at which the	file pointer, if defined, is
	  pointing).  The size of a word is the	size of	an integer and
	  varies from machine to machine.  Putw	neither	assumes	nor
	  causes special alignment in the file.
	  Output streams, with the exception of	the standard error
	  stream stderr, are by	default	buffered if the	output refers
	  to a file and	line-buffered if the output refers to a
	  terminal.  The standard error	output stream stderr is	by
	  default unbuffered, but use of freopen [see fopen(3S)] will
	  cause	it to become buffered or line-buffered.	 When an
	  output stream	is unbuffered, information is queued for
	  writing on the destination file or terminal as soon as
	  written; when	it is buffered,	many characters	are saved up
	  and written as a block.  When	it is line-buffered, each line
	  of output is queued for writing on the destination terminal
	  as soon as the line is completed (that is, as	soon as	a
	  new-line character is	written	or terminal input is
				  
	  requested).  Setbuf(3S) or Setbuf(3S)	may be used to change
	  the stream's buffering strategy.
SEE ALSO
	  fclose(3S), ferror(3S), fopen(3S), fread(3S),	printf(3S),
	  puts(3S), setbuf(3S).
DIAGNOSTICS
	  On success, putc, fputc, and putchar each return the value
	  they have written.  On failure, they return the constant
	  EOF.	This will occur	if the file stream is not open for
	  writing or if	the output file	cannot be grown.  Putw returns
	  nonzero when an error	has occured, otherwise zero.
BUGS
	  Because it is	implemented as a macro,	putc treats
	  incorrectly a	stream argument	with side effects.  In
	  particular, putc(c, *f++); doesn't work sensibly.  Fputc
	  should be used instead.
	  Because of possible differences in word length and byte
	  ordering, files written using	putw are machine-dependent,
	  and may not be read using getw on a different	processor.
