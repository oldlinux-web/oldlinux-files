     Cal prints a calendar for a month or year.  The year can be between
1  and  9999.  Note  that  the year 91 is not a synonym for 1991, but is
itself a valid year about 19 centuries ago.  The  calendar  produced  is
the one used by England and her colonies.  Try Sept. 1752, Feb 1900, and
Feb 2000.  If you do not understand what is going on, look up  Calendar,
Gregorian in a good encyclopedia.
