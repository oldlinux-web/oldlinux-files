Syntax:    treecmp [-cv] olddir newdir
Flags:     -c  (changes) list the names of changed or new files
           -v  (verbose) list all directories processed
Example:   treecmp -v /usr/ast/V1 /usr/ast/V2 # Compare two trees

     Treecmp recursively descends  the  directory  tree  of  its  second
argument  and  compares all files to those at the corresponding position
in the first argument. If the two trees are  identical,  i.e.,  all  the
corresponding  directories  and  files are the same, there is no output.
Otherwise, a list of files missing from one of the trees or  present  in
both but whose contents are not identical in both are printed.  When the
-c flag is given, only files that are changed from the  old  version  or
are new (i.e., absent in the old version) are listed.
