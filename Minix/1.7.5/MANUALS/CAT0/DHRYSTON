Syntax:    dhrystone
Flags:     (none)
Example:   dhrystone                # Run the dhrystone benchmark

     Many years ago, a floating-point  benchmark  called  whetstone  was
popular   for  benchmarking  FORTRAN  programs.   Nowadays,  an  integer
benchmark called dhrystone is widely used for benchmarking UNIX systems.
This  is  it.  Be warned, however, that dhrystone is entirely CPU bound,
and goes blindingly fast on machines with high-speed  caches.   Although
this  is  a  good  measure for programs that spend most of their time in
some inner loop, it is a poor benchmark for I/O bound applications.
