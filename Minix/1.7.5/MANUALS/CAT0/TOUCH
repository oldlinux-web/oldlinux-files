Command:   touch - update a file's time of last modification
Syntax:    touch [-c] file ...
Flags:     -c  Do not create the file
Example:   touch *.h                # Make the .h files look recent

     The time of last modification is set to  the  current  time.   This
command  is  mostly used to trick make into thinking that a file is more
recent than it really is.  If the file being touched does not exist,  it
is created, unless the -c flag is present.
