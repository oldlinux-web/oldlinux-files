Syntax:    prep [file]
Flags:     (none)
Example:   prep infile >outfile     # Prepare infile

     Prep strips off most of the troff commands from  a  text  file  and
then  outputs  all the words, one word per line, in the order they occur
in the file.  This file can then be sorted and compared to a  dictionary
(as a spelling checker), or used for statistical analyses.
