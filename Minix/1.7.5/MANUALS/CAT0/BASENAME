Syntax:    basename file [suffix]
Flags:     (none)
Examples:  basename /user/ast/file.c # Strips path to yield file.c
           basename /user/file.c .c # Strips path and .c to yield file

     The initial directory names (if any) are removed yielding the  name
of  the file itself.  If a second argument is present, it is interpreted
as a suffix and is also stripped, if present.  This program is primarily
used in shell scripts.
