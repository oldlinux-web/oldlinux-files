Syntax:    which name
Flags:     (none)
Example:   which a.out              # Tells which a.out will be executed

     The $PATH shell variable controls the  MINIX  search  rules.  If  a
command a.out is given, the shell first tries to find an executable file
in the working directory. If that fails,  it  looks  in  various  system
directories, such as /bin and /usr/bin. The which command makes the same
search and gives the absolute path of the program that will  be  chosen,
followed by other occurrences of the file name along the path.
