Technical Info on FIPS
----------------------

FIPS was written in C++ V2.0 with the Turbo C++ 1.0 and Borland C++ 3.1
compilers.
It should compile with any newer C++ compiler (perhaps after minor changes
to the BIOS calls).

If you're a C++ wizard, don't look too closely at the code, this is my first
C++ program, so it is far from acceptable (too much public data, some ini-
tializers and assignment operators are missing etc.). Constructive critizism
is always welcome however.

How FIPS works:

FIPS uses the BIOS interrupts 13h 00h (reset disks), 13h 02h (read sector),
13h 08h (get drive parameters), 13h 03h (write sector) and 13h 04h (verify
sector).

Here is the sequence of function calls in main:

evaluate_argument_vector
  read the commandline arguments and set the global variables accordingly
notice
  display copyright notice and version number
ask_for_drive_number
  let the user choose the drive (if more than 1)
harddrive.reset
  reset harddrive
harddrive.rootsector->read
  read the sector 0,0,1 of the chosen drive into an array of unsigned char
hd.partition_table().get
  extract the necessary information from the root sector (see below - The
  root sector)
hd.print_partition_table
  print the information
hd.check
  check if everything is ok (see below - The root sector)
ask_for_partition_number
  let the user choose the partition
partition->bootsector->read
  read the first sector of the chosen partition to another array
partition->bpb().get
  extract info from the boot sector (see below - The boot sector)
partition->print_bpb
  print the info
partition->info().get
  calculate no. of clusters, starting sector of FATs etc.
partition->check
  check boot sector (see below - The boot sector)
fat1.check_against(fat2)
  check if FAT 1 is identical to FAT 2 (see below - The FAT)
save_root_and_boot
  write root- and boot sector to floppy disk (optional)
ask_for_new_start_cylinder
  ask the user for the first cylinder of the new partition
fat2.check_empty
  check if chosen part of partition is empty (see below - The FAT)
hd.calculate_new_root
  from the chosen start cylinder calculate the new partition table
  Note that the partition entries will be moved to the beginning of the par- 
  tition table, so that the new partition will be the last one and the drive
  names will not change.
hd.partition_table.put
  write the new partition table into the root sector buffer
hd.partition_table.get,hd.print_partition_table,hd.check
  check if new root sector is ok
partition->calculate_new_boot
  put new number of sectors in boot sector info
partition->bpb()->put
  write new boot sector info into boot sector buffer
partition->bpb()->get,partition->print_bpb,partition->check
  check if new boot sector is ok
ask_for_write_permission
  ask if user wants to proceed
harddrive.rootsector->write
  write the changed root sector to the disk
partition->bootsector->write
  write the changed boot sector to the disk


The root sector
---------------

The root sector is the first sector on every hard disk. It contains the
program that loads the boot sector of the bootable partition and the
partition table. The last two bytes of the root sector must be 55 aa (hex).
The partition table begins at 1be. It contains 4 * 16 Bytes for the four
possible partitions.
All numbers are zero based except the start/end-sector number (may be 1-63).
One partition entry contains the following:

1 Byte - Bootable Flag. Must be 0 (not bootable) or 80h (bootable).
	 At most one Partition may be bootable at a time.
	 (somewhere I read the bootable flag may also be 81h for the
	 second drive - does anybody know anything about that?)

1 Byte - Start Head. The number of the head of the first sector of the
	 partition.

2 Bytes - Start Sector + Cylinder. The Bits are as follows:

			CCSSSSSS CCCCCCCC

	  where the first byte contains the sector number (1 - 63), and
	  the high two bits of the cylinder number. The second byte con-
	  tains the low eight bits of the cylinder number.

1 Byte - System Indicator. For DOS this may be:

	1 - 12-bit FAT, 16-bit sector number
	4 - 16-bit FAT, 16-bit sector number
	5 - Extended Partition
	6 - 16-bit FAT, 32-bit sector number

1 Byte - End Head. Head Number of the last sector of the partition

2 Bytes - End Sector + Cylinder. Same format as Start Sector + Cylinder

4 Bytes - First Sector. Number of the first sector of the partition. This
	  corresponds to the Start Head, Sector + Cylinder. High Byte
	  comes first.

4 Bytes - Total number of Sectors.

The function check_rootsector_validity checks the following:

- Signature Bytes (55 aa) in the last two bytes of the sector
- not more than one bootable partition
- Bootable flag is 0 or 80h
- Start/End sector of a partition is not 0
- Start/End sector & head are not greater than drive geometry allows
- Start cylinder * sectors * heads + start head * sectors + start sector - 1
  = first sector (where sectors is no. of sectors per track, heads is
  no. of heads of the drive)
- End cylinder * sectors * heads + end head * sector + end sector = first
  sector + number of sectors
- if System Indicator is 0, all other bytes of partition entry are 0
- all partitions except the first begin on cylinder boundaries (head = 0,
  sectors = 1)
- all partition end on cylinder boundaries
- partitions don't overlap
- no free space between partitions


The boot sector
---------------

The boot sector is the first sector of every partition. It contains the
program that boots the operating system and the bios parameter block.
The last two bytes must again contain 55 aa. The information in the
boot sector is the following:

00  3 bytes  jump instruction ('eb xx 90' or 'e9 xx xx')
03  8 bytes  OEM name and version - e.g. MSDOS5.0
0b  2 bytes  bytes per sector - should be 512
0d  1 byte   sectors per cluster - power of two
0e  2 bytes  reserved sectors - typically 1 (boot sector)
10  1 byte   number of FATs - must be 2
11  2 bytes  number of rootdirectory entries - typically 512
13  2 bytes  number of sectors (short) - 0, if BIGDOS partition
15  1 byte   media descriptor - typically f8h
16  2 bytes  sectors per FAT - varies
18  2 bytes  sectors per track
1a  2 bytes  number of heads
1c  2 bytes  number of hidden sectors (low)

- extended BPB since DOS 4.0 -

1e  2 bytes  number of hidden sectors (high)
20  4 bytes  number of sectors (long)
24  1 byte   physical drive number - 80h or 81h
25  1 byte   reserved
26  1 byte   signature - 29h

The function check_bootsector_validity checks the following:

- correct jump instruction
- signature bytes 55 aa in the last two bytes of the sector
- bytes per sector = 512
- sectors per cluster is power of two
- reserved sectors = 1
- number of FATs = 2
- number of rootdirectory entries is multiple of 16
- media descriptor = f8h
- sectors per fat <= 256
- sectors per fat big enough to hold complete FAT
- sectors per track matches BIOS info
- number of heads matches BIOS info
- hidden sectors = start sector
- signature = 29h, if BIGDOS
- physical drive number = actual drive number
- number of sectors matches partition info
- system indicator byte in root sector matches partition type


The FAT
-------

The File Allocation Table contains the information how the clusters of the
disk are linked to files. Every directory entry contains a pointer to the
first cluster of the file. The corresponding cluster entry in the FAT con-
tains a pointer to the next cluster, or an EOF marker (FFFF for 16-bit FATs,
FFF for 12-bit FATs) if the cluster is the last one of the file.
Bad clusters are marked with FFF7 or FF7. Empty clusters are marked with 0.
The first cluster on the disk is cluster number 2, it begins at the first
sector after the root directory. The FAT entries for the clusters 0 and 1
contain the media descriptor byte (usually F8h for harddisk) and two or
three FFh bytes.
There exist two copies of the FAT on a normal DOS partition, these two
copies must be identical. FAT 2 is the primary FAT.

The function check_fat_validity checks if the two FATs are identical and if
the entries 0 and 1 contain what they are supposed to.

The function check_fat_empty checks if the cluster entries that cover the
new partition contain either 0 (empty) or FFF7 (Bad cluster).

exact or if you have additions, please let me know asap.
