		TUTORIAL FOR INSTALLING MINIX-386

Modified 12/3/90: jwn

	This is meant to be a step-by-step tutorial on moving from
standard Minix 1.5.10 to Bruce Evans's modification which allows the
full use of the Intel 386 CPU.  I'm going to refer to the modified
system from here on out as "Minix-386", but it should be clearly
understood that we are merely talking about standard Minix, with the
modifications written by Bruce.

	I'm also going to make certain assumptions regarding the
audience for such a tutorial.  These assumptions are as follows:

	1.  Access to the Internet, and capability of transferring
	    files via ftp.

	2.  A 386 system, with a hard-disk and at least a 1.2 meg
	    floppy drive.  Minix 1.5.10 should be already installed
	    on the hard-disk.

	3.  Some means of transferring binary files from Internet
	    to the Minix system.  In my case, I use PC-NFS, and can
	    ftp from DOS and then use DOSREAD from Minix.  But just
	    whatever works for you should be ok.  Just remember that
	    these files are BINARY, so when using things such as ftp,
	    dosread and kermit, be sure and set the binary option.

	4.  Familiarity with such standard programs as ftp, patch, make,
	    dosread, crc, etc.  I'll try and make comments from time to
	    time which may be helpful, but I am not going to really get
	    down to basics.  You most likely want to hold off on going to
	    an experimental system such as Minix-386 if you are not at
	    least at that level.  (On the other hand, there's nothing like
	    jumping in the water to learn to swim, and if someone gives
	    it the old college try anyway, don't hesitate to send me some
	    e-mail if you have a problem, even if it is really basic).  I
	    strongly recommend the excellent tutorial which Glen Overby
	    wrote, and which is available from plains.nodak.edu.  I do not
	    remember the exact name, but it is something like Glen0.tute.tar.

	Before starting this, I recommend that you back up your Minix system
if you have not already done so.  Although nothing that I am going to tell
you *should* mess up your hard disk....always remember Murphy's law!

	Get a good 1.2 meg floppy disk, format it, and then make a file
system on it.  (mkfs /dev/at0 1200).

	
------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  ftp to an archive.  I recommend plains.nodak.edu [134.129.111.64]
	 if you're in the US, but there are probably other good ones as 
	 well.  The following is going to assume plains.nodak.edu.

Step 2.   Change to directory pub/Minix/oz.

Step 3.   Set mode to binary and ftp the following files:

          mx386_1.1.t.Z
          mx386_1.1.01.Z
	  bcc.tar.Z
	  bccbin16.tar.Z
	  bccbin32.tar.Z
	  bcclib.tar.Z
	  shoelace-1.0a.tar.Z

	Note: There are other interesting files in pub/Minix/oz, but
I recommend you stick with these.  (NOTE: At the time this tutorial
was originally written, there was a problem with cppmake at Minix
1.5.10.  Since that time, cppmake has been re-released to the net
at the 1.5.10 level.  Unfortunately, I have not yet had a chance to
check it out, so I'm not going to change the tutorial yet.  But I
probably will on the next iteration).

          mx386_1.1.t.Z is a compressed, tar file of all of the
material necessary to get Minix-386 running.

          mx386_1.1.01.Z is a compressed ASCII file (not a tar
file) which contains a bug fix necessary for mx386_1.1.t.Z.

	  bcc.tar.Z is a compressed tar file of the source
file for bcc (which we won't use, but I recommend getting it anyway,
just in case).  This file also contains bcc.doc and bcc.bugs.  These
are not needed immediately, but should be read before doing anything
with the source (bcc.c).

	  bccbin16.tar.Z is a compressed tar file containing binaries
for the version of the compiler that runs under standard Minix 1.5.10.

	  bccbin32.tar.Z is a compressed tar file containing binaries
for the version of the compiler that runs under Minix-386.

	  bcclib.tar.Z are all the library source files necessary
to support the compiler.

	  shoelace-1.0a.tar.Z is a collection of files necessary to
utilize what has been called "a preliminary boot program".  It has
very good documentation, and is probably a good thing to use.  In
this document, however, I am just going to use it to make a floppy
that will boot up your 32-bit system because I cannot for the life
of me make a boot disk the regular way that works.  If you can, I
urge you to post the necessary information :-)  To make matters
even worse, the first time I compiled the system, I DID make a good
boot disk...but I can't duplicate it.  Shoelace is better, anyway.

	  NOTE:  It may seem a little confusing that there are two
compilers, which seem to be alike, but there is a good explanation.
Either of the compilers will produce either 16-bit or 32-bit object
files (depending on whether they get a -0 argument or a -3 argument).
However, the present Minix system only runs in the 16 bit mode.  So
therefore, you have to have a compiler which also runs in the 16 bit
mode.  Use it to produce 32-bit object files, and then after you have
a 32-bit version of Minix, you can use the 32-bit compiler.

	Now set up a Minix directory called /usr/oz, and move all of
the ftp'd files to Minix, using DOSREAD or whatever other mechanism you
might have.  (If you have a Unix machine, such as a Sun or whatever,
you might want to uncompress and untar there, and just move the files
over to Minix.  If you do that, you have to make the appropriate
adjustments to the following steps).  

Step 4.   Uncompress all files:

          compress -d mx386_1.1.t.Z     # produce a tar file
          compress -d mx386_1.1.01.Z    # produce an ASCII message
	      ...etc.

	NOTE: Most of the tar files, when untarred, will make their
own subdirectory.  However, Shoelace does not do this, so you have
to manually make a shoelace directory (/usr/oz/shoelace), move the
.tar file to it, and untar it there.

Step 5.   Untar mx386_1.1.t (tar xf mx386_1.1.t).  This will make 
a subdirectory called mx386_1.1, which contains the following:

               README1.1      # read this!!
               bin0           # a directory - 16 bit compiler
               bin3           # another directory - 32 bit compiler
               fs             # another directory - fs material
               kernel         # another directory - kernel stuff
               mm             # another directory - mm stuff
               tools          # another directory - tools stuff
               mx386_1.1.crc  # crc listing of mx386 package
               runtime.crc    # crc listing of things needed

	Lets rename the subdirectory ("mv mx386_1.1 mx386"), since
it is easier to work with that short name :-)

	Also, at this point, stop, get a beer (or a cup of coffee)
and carefully read the README1.1 file.  It tells you just about
everything that is in this tutorial.  So use it as a reference
guide.  

Step 6.	Untar mx386_1.1.01, and use a text editor, such as elle,
to remove the top material, so that you can run it through the
shell (i.e., remove everything up to the line that says "/bin/sh").
Then run it through the shell ("/bin/sh mx386_1.1.01").

Step 7.	This will give you a .crc and a .cdif file.  Move both of
them to the /usr/oz/mx386/kernel directory and run patch against klib386.x
with the .cdif file (that is: "patch klib386.x klib386.x.cdif") to
produce an updated klib386.x file.  Check the new crc against the
one given in the .crc file.

Step 8.  Mount your 1.2 meg floppy - let us say on user.  (That
is, do a /etc/mount /dev/at0 /user, assuming that you have 
your 1.2 meg drive as drive 0)

	AT THIS POINT, I AM GOING TO ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE A
DIRECTORY CALLED /USR/OZ/MX386, AND THAT THE MATERIAL WHICH CAME
FROM THE FILE MX386 FILES IS IN IT.  I AM GOING TO ALSO ASSUME THAT
YOU HAVE A DIRECTORY CALLED /USR/OZ/BCC, AND THAT THE MATERIAL WHICH
CAME FROM THE BCC FILES IS IN IT.  THE /USR/OZ/BCC DIRECTORY  LOOKS 
LIKE THIS:

	bcc - a directory, which came from bcc.tar.Z
	bccbin16 - a directory, which came from bccbin16.tar.Z
	bccbin32 - a directory, which came from bccbin32.tar.Z
	bcclib - a directory, which came from bcclib.tar.Z


Step 9.  Here we will make the directory structure on /user which will be
needed as the root when you boot up your 32-bit system.


	cd /user		# (mounted above, on at0)
	mkdir usr		# /usr for Minix-386

	cd /			# copy root stuff to new partition
	cpdir -s dev /user/dev
	cpdir -ms etc /user/etc
	cd /user/etc
	rm mount umount update	# ruthlessly root out 16-bit binaries

	Note: Edit /user/etc/rc so that it does not try and mount stuff.
Just comment out the part that mounts /usr.  Your /usr directory will be
on the floppy when you boot it up later.  In fact, I recommend going
through /user/etc/rc and commenting out everything which is not absolutely
essential.  

	Now, set up root for compiling stuff.  You don't want to have your
root in RAM for this.  I presume you are mounting a disk partition as
root.  If not, you will have to change all the paths "/local/..." in
bcc.c to something else, perhaps "/usr/local/...", and recompile bcc.
	
	cd /
	mkdir local

	cd /usr/oz/bcc
	cpdir -ms bccbin16 /local/bin	# Move 16-bit compiler
	cpdir -ms bccbin32 /local/bin3	# and the 32-bit compiler


Step 10.	Now you need to go through and apply Bruce's changes to the
standard 1.5.10 material.  ("cpdir -ms" is recommended by Bruce).

	cd /usr/oz/mx386
	cpdir -ms bin0 /local/bin	# 16-bit compiler stuff
	cpdir -ms bin3 /local/bin3	# 32-bit compiler stuff
	cpdir -ms fs /usr/src/fs	# mods for fs
	cpdir -ms kernel /usr/src/kernel	# mods for kernel
	cpdir -ms mm /usr/src/mm	# mods for mm
	cpdir -ms tools /usr/src/tools	# mods for tools

Step 11.	Now apply Bruce's changes to /usr include and 
to the standard library routines.

	cd /usr/oz/bcc/lib/fix1.5.10	# move Bruce's changes
	cp include.cdif /usr/include	# to include

	cp ansi.cdif /usr/src/lib/ansi	# to ansi
	cp other.cdif /usr/src/lib/other	# to other
	cp posix.cdif /usr/src/lib/posix	# and to posix

	cd /usr/include	# now apply the changes
	patch < include.cdif
	
	cd /usr/src/lib/ansi
	patch < ansi.cdif

	cd /usr/src/lib/other
	patch < other.cdif

	cd /usr/src/lib/posix
	patch < posix.cdif

	Also apply the necessary changes to tools

	cd /usr/src/tools
	patch < tools.cdif

Step 12.	Copy the additional bcc library stuff.

	cd /usr/oz/bcc/lib
	cpdir -ms bcc /usr/src/lib/bcc

Step 13.   At this point, you should use /usr/oz/mx386/runtime.crc  and
check the crc's against your files.

NOTE:  What Bruce refers to as "/local/bin0" will be your "/local/bin",
and what he refers to as "/local/bin" will be your "/local/bin3".  That
is, he is using the bin3 directory for bin, and you want to use the bin0
directory as bin.

You will notice that he does not give a crc for EVERYTHING which
is on your file system, but only for the things that he has either
added or put there.  So, for example, in crc checking /usr/include,
he gives under "/usr/include" the routines which were patched, such as
fcntl.h, lib.h, etc.  The stuff shown as "/usr/include/dist" is merely
for comparison with standard 1.5.10, and should not necessarily be on
your partition.  However, if you want to really be safe, you could set
up such a subdirectory to save the things prior to changing them, so
that you can always go back to where you where.  (But since I advised
you to backup before you started, it should not be necessary.....)

	The material which he does NOT show - for example the remainder of
/usr/include - is expected to match Minix 1.5.10 crc's.  If you did not
have a clean 1.5.10 system (i.e., matched crc's) to begin with, there may
be problems.  Do not be fooled (like I did) into thinking that just because
it is not shown in runtime.crc that it should not be there!
	
	However, in the real world we live in, very few of us actually do
have exact crc matches on EVERYTHING....so do the best you can with it.
Use caution, however.  If every little library routine and makefile does
not match to the nth degree, you may, with luck, get by.  But if there
are big discrepancies, or the discrepancy is in the operating system
itself, you might save time by getting if fixed before proceeding.

	In /usr/src/kernel, note that the crc for klib386.x shown in the
runtime.crc file is not correct, since you should have previously patched
that with the material from the mx386_1.1.01 file.  The correct crc should
be:

	54263	20437	klib386.x

	My makefile.cpp for /usr/src/kernel also does not match the
runtime.crc file (I show 03660	4085	makefile.cpp).

	Note that for /usr/src/lib/ansi, posix, and other, Bruce again
shows on runtime.crc only the files which he changed.  There will, of course,
be ALL of the files from Minix 1.5.10 in /usr/src/lib.  The ones which
he does not show should match Minix 1.5.10 crc's.


Step 14.  Recompile "make" so that it will recognize .o files (instead of
using .s files).  To do this, just change to your /usr/src/commands/make
directory, and edit the Makefile to remove -DPCMINIX from the CFLAGS line,
so that it just reads "CFLAGS = -Dunix".  Then do a make, produce a new
object file of make, and move it to /usr/bin (I would recommend that you
save the old make first.  For example:

		cd /usr/bin
		mv make make_s
		cd /usr/src/commands/bin
		mv make /usr/bin

Step 15.  Now, we are ready to compile the libraries.  First of all,
change your path, so that you will have access to the compiler.  At
the same time, change cc to something else, and link the name "cc" to
the bcc compiler.  (The reason for changing cc to some other name is
to be sure that if you re-boot and forget to change your path, you
will not start compiling with the wrong compiler!)


	PATH=/local/bin:$PATH
	export PATH
	cd /usr/bin	# assuming that cc is here
	mv cc cc_old
	cd /local/bin
	ln bcc cc	# since some makefiles use cc

Step 16. Now, lets compile the libraries...but before doing so, be SURE that
there aren't any refuge .s files hanging around.  They cause problems!

	cd /usr/src/lib/ansi
	rm *.s
	cd ../posix
	rm *.s
	cd ../ibm
	rm *.s
	cd ../other
	rm *.s
	cd ../string
	rm *.s

	cd /usr/src/lib/bcc
	sh makelib 86 | tee makelib.out 2>&1

	Several things can go wrong here.  If something is not working, check
to be sure you set the PATH right.  Check to be sure that you have the proper
files in /local/bin.  Check to be sure that cpp is in /lib (because it is 
needed to convert .x files).  Check to be sure that you don't have some kind
of garbage in with the source files.  If you get compile errors, check to be
sure that your crc's check with Bruce's.  There should not be any compile
errors.  Check the file makelib.out carefully, and see if it contains any
error messages.  There should not be any.  If there are, fix them, clean
up stuff by doing:

	sh makelib 86 clean

and then start over with:

	sh makelib 86 | tee makelib.out 2>&1

	But assuming everything is eventually ok, you should now have a 
16-bit library which will be in /usr/src/lib/bcc/i86.  Move this to 
/usr/local/lib/i86, as shown in the following:

	cd /usr
	mkdir local
	cd local
	mkdir lib
	cd lib
	mkdir i86
	cd /usr/src/lib/bcc/i86
	cp * /usr/local/lib/i86

	There is a little library which we need for /usr/src/kernel, so
let's go ahead and make it now.

	cd /usr/src/lib/bcc/86
	ar r /usr/src/kernel/longlib.a laddl.o lcmpl.o ldecl.o lorl.o \
            lsll.o lsrul.o
	cd /usr/src/kernel
	ar t longlib.a		# check to be sure they are there...

	Now, clean up the 16 bit stuff, so the 32-bit library can be compiled.
There are things in it the 16-bit library which later on are going to
be needed to make the 32-bit system.  Later on, if you get cramped for
space, you can remove the 16-bit libraries if you run completely under
Minix-386.

	cd /usr/src/lib/bcc
	sh makelib 86 clean

	sh makelib 386 | tee makelib.out 2>&1

	Same warnings hold, of course, as above.  But if the 16-bit library
compiled ok, most likely the 32-bit one will also :-)

	cd /usr/src/lib/bcc/i386
	cp * /usr/local/lib/i386	# copy to permanent home

	sh makelib 386 clean	# if you are tight for space

Step 17.	OK, now lets make the operating system itself.  The time has
now come to discuss the makefile problem.  Bruce has assumed that we are
using cppmake.  But, as previously stated, cppmake was not working under
Minix 1.5.10 when I put this tutorial together, so I recommend we go without 
it for now (coward's way out - I SHOULD check out the new cppmake and change
the tutorial accordingly!)
	
	The first thing to do is to make the directory where kernel, fs, and mm
are going to be put (that is, the object files).

		cd /etc
		mkdir system

	Doing the makefiles for mm and fs are both easy.  Just use elle and
delete some blanks which are at the beginning of some of the "#" commands.
Then use cpp to generate a makefile.  

		cd /usr/src/mm
		rm *.s *.o		# can't be too careful...
		elle makefile.cpp	# be sure all "#" commands start in column 1
		/usr/lib/cpp -P -DINTEL_32BITS makefile.cpp > makefile
		make		# generate /etc/system/mm

		cd /usr/src/fs
		rm *.s *.o
		elle makefile.cpp	# again, be sure all "#" commands start in col 1
		/usr/lib/cpp -P -DINTEL_32BITS makefile.cpp > makefile
		make		# generate /etc/system/fs

	NOTE: You will get a warning message from ld that _exit has been
redefined.  This is normal.	

	/usr/src/kernel gives more of a problem, because cpp does not like the
comments (which begin with "#") in makefile.cpp.  The easiest thing seems to
just make a copy of makefile.cpp, use elle to remove all of the comments, and
then run cpp on it.  Be careful though that when you remove something that it
IS a comment, rather than a cpp command! So read before deleting.

		cd /usr/src/kernel
		cp makefile.cpp xx
		elle xx		# remove all of the comment lines
		rm *.s *.o	# be sure...
		config 386	# set up proper files.
		/usr/lib/cpp -P -DINTEL_32BITS xx > makefile
		make		# generate  /etc/system/kernel

	NOTE: ld complains that _unlock and _lock are redefined. Again,
this is normal.

	PROBLEM AT THIS POINT!  I have not had much luck with making a
boot disk using /usr/src/tools, so I am going to recommend using the
Shoelace method instead.  Therefore, I am going to just make init, move
it over to /etc/system, and stop there, so that I can get this $%@#&
tutorial posted!  (But I'll keep working on it :-))

	By the way, a comment was made on the net that the stacksize
in init.c needs to be made greater.  I have not personally had a problem
with it, but you might want to consider changing the constant within
init.c to make it greater, if you have a problem with loading init.

		cd /usr/src/tools
		cc -3 -c -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX init.c
		ld -3 -o /etc/system/init /usr/local/lib/i386/head.o \
		init.o /usr/local/lib/i386/libc.a 

	NOTE:  ld complains that _sbrk and _exit are redefined.  Again,
this is normal.

Step 18.  Now, go back to /usr/src/oz and uncompress and untar the file
containing Shoelace (shoelace-1.0a.tar.Z).  You need to switch back to
the regular old ACK compiler, and use the old version of make.

		cd /usr/bin
		mv cc_old cc
		mv make make_o
		mv make_s make
		PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
		export PATH
		cd /usr/src/oz/shoelace
		make -f makefile.min	# make shoelace stuff

	Read the file "readme" carefully.  It will tell you in detail
how to make a floppy disk.  Just use the 1.2 meg disk that you already
have mounted for this!  That is, do the "./laceup /dev/at0 5.25dshd".
(The readme file says to use /dev/fd0 5.2h dsdd, but since you have a 1.2 meg
disk, you need to use /dev/at0 5.25dshd).  Next, copy shoelace to it, as 
per the readme file.  THEN, copy the kernel, mm, fs and init files.  Copy
config to /user/etc/config.

		cd /etc/system
		cp * /user	# copy kernel, fs, mm, init

	(Do NOT, however, follow the readme directions to "copy a /bin/sh, login,
etc. onto the floppy" because you want to put 32-bit versions of these on there.
This will be done a little bit later.)

	Also, you need to edit the /user/config file a little bit, so that
it fits your configuration.  Use elle and comment out the line which says:

		run	/etc/system/db

Step 19.  If all of this worked ok, then you should now have a 32-bit boot
disk.  Now, you want to Make a few more 32-bit files...which means that you
need to compile a few commands.  First, switch back to bcc:

		cd /usr/bin
		mv cc cc_old
		mv make make_s
		mv make_o make
		PATH=/local/bin:$PATH
		export path

	Now make the files you are going to need:


	cd /user
	mkdir bin
	cd /usr/src/commands/sh

	We will dispense with using makefiles for right now...you can play
with these and adjust them to your satisfaction later.

	rm *.s *.o
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -o /user/bin/sh *.c
	cd /usr/src/commands
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/bin/login login.c
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/etc/update update.c
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/etc/mount mount.c
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/etc/umount umount.c
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/bin/cat cat.c
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/bin/ls ls.c
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/bin/cp cp.c

	cd /usr/src/commands/ibm
	cc -3 -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_MINIX -o /user/bin/readclock readclock.c

	NOW, finally, and at last.  You have a 1.2 meg floppy which has
a Minix-386 system on it (a skelton system, to be sure), and which you
can boot up.  What you want to do now is boot it up, see if everything
works, and if it does, you should be able to now think in terms of making
a Minix-386 hard disk partition, compiling all commands, etc. 

	The biggest problem that you are going to have is mixing the
16-bit and 32-bit binaries.  If you try and run a 16-bit program while
in 32-bit mode, you get an error.  And vice-versa.  Here is a little
program you can run to check:

	main()
	{
		char buf[10];
		if (read(0,buf,4) != 4) {
			printf("Length error reading file.\n");
			exit(1);
		}
		if (buf[3] == 0x04)
			printf(" is 8086\n");
		else if (buf[3] == 0x10)
			printf(" is 80386\n");
		else
			printf(" is unknown\n");
	}

	Just compile it and run it against /bin, /usr/bin, /etc.
For example, say you call the program "check_cpu":

		cd /usr
		for i in *
		do
			echo $i - `(check_cpu < $i)`
		done


	Good luck, congratulations, and welcome to Minix-386!!!

	Another problem which pops up is that /etc/rc will have a
call to something which does not exist.  This makes the system hang.
For example, if you do not have a program called /usr/bin/readclock,
but yet /etc/rc has a command to execute that program, you hang!
