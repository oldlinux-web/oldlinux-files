Exceptions are interrupts that are generated internally by the CPU
when certain conditions are detected during the execution of a
program.  Examples of such conditions are: use of an invalid selector,
use of a selector for which the program has insufficient privileges,
use of an offset outside the limits of a segment, execution of an
illegal opcode, or division by zero.  The DPMI host distinguishes
between exceptions and external hardware interrupts or software
interrupts. <p>

Handlers for exceptions can only be installed with <a
href="api/310203.html">Int 31H Functions 0203H</a>, <a
href="api/310212.html">0212H</a>, or <a
href="api/310213.html">0213H</a>.  If the client does not install a
handler for a particular exception, or installs a handler but chains
to the host's default handler, the host reflects the exception as a
real mode interrupt for exceptions 0,1,2,3,4,5, and 7.  The default
behavior of exceptions 6 and 8-1FH is to terminate the client (some
hosts may decide that they have to terminate the VM because the fault
came from real mode code or it is in a non-terminatable state).<p>

<a href="api/310203.html">Function 0203H</a> was defined in DPMI version 0.9 and continues to be
supported in DPMI version 1.0 for compatibility reasons.  Exception
handlers installed with <a href="api/310203.html">Function 0203H</a> are only called for exceptions
that occur in protected mode.  All exceptions are examined by the DPMI
host.  The host processes any exception that it is responsible for,
such as page fault for virtual memory management.  These <i>transparent
exceptions</i> are never passed to the client exception handlers.  All
other exceptions become <i>visible exceptions</i> to a client and are
passed to the client exception handler (if any) from the DPMI host.
The client exception handlers must return with a <tt>FAR RETURN</tt>,
with interrupts disabled on a locked stack, and with SS, (E)SP, CS,
and (E)IP registers at the point of exception pushed on the stack.
All other registers are unchanged from their contents at the point of
exception.  The stack frame for 16-bit handlers installed with
Function 0203H has the following format:

<pre>
	15		0
	+---------------+
	|	SS	|
	|---------------|  0EH
	|	SP	|
	|---------------|  0CH
	|     Flags	|
	|---------------|  0AH
	|	CS	|
	|---------------|  08H
	|	IP	|
	|---------------|  06H
	|   Error Code	|
	|---------------|  04H
	|   Return CS	|
	|---------------|  02H
	|   Return IP	|
	|---------------|  00H <-- SS:SP
</pre>

The stack frame for 32-bit handlers installed with <a
href="api/310203.html">Function 0203H</a> has the following format:

<pre>
	31		15		0
	+---------------+---------------|
	|    Reserved	|	SS	|
	+---------------+---------------| 1CH
	|	       ESP		|
	|-------------------------------| 18H
	|	     EFLAGS		|
	|---------------+---------------| 14H
	|    Reserved   |	CS	|
	|---------------+---------------| 10H
	|	       EIP		|
	|-------------------------------| 0CH
	|	   Error Code		|
	|---------------+---------------| 08H
	|		|   Return CS	|
	|---------------+---------------| 04H
	|	   Return EIP		|
	|-------------------------------| 00H <-- SS:ESP
</pre>

The error code in the stack frame is only valid for the following
exceptions:

<table>
<tr><td align=center>08H</td><td align=left>Double fault</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0AH</td><td align=left>Invalid TSS</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0BH</td><td align=left>Segment not present</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0CH</td><td align=left>Stack fault</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0DH</td><td align=left>General protection fault</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0EH</td><td align=left>Page Fault</td></tr>
</table>

In the case of other exceptions and faults, the value of the error
code is undefined.  The fields marked <tt>Return CS</tt>, <tt>Return
(E)IP</tt>, and <tt>Reserved</tt> in the stack frame should should not
be modified, but anything else in the stack frame can be altered by
the client before returning from the exception handler. <p>

The exception handler must preserve and restore all registers, and
must either jump to the next handler in the chain or terminate with a
<tt>RETF</tt> (far return) instruction.  In the latter case, the
original SS:(E)SP, CS:(E)IP and flags on the stack, including the
interrupt flag, will be restored.  The exception handler can arrange
to transfer control to a more general error-handling routine within
the application by modifying the CS:(E)IP that is stored in the stack
frame above the Return CS:(E)IP. <p>

DPMI version 1.0 supports an expanded stack frame for exception
handlers, and the ability to install separate handlers for exceptions
which occur in real mode and in protected mode with <a
href="api/310210.html">Functions 0212H</a> and <a
href="api/310213.html">0213H</a>.  The expanded frame is defined on
the stack <i>above</i> the frame previously described for handlers
installed with <a href="api/310203.html">Function 0203H</a>.  This
allows DPMI 0.9-compatible handlers and DPMI 1.0-compatible handlers
to coexist in the same handler chain; old handlers will be oblivious
to the additional information available beyond the old stack frame,
while new handlers can ignore the old frame and use only the expanded
frame higher up on the stack. <p>

The format of the expanded stack frame for both 16-bit and 32-bit
handlers installed with <a href="api/310212.html">Functions 0212H</a>
and <a href="api/310213.html">0213H</a> is as follows:

<pre>
31				15				0
+---------------------------------------------------------------+ 58H
|				PTE				|
|---------------------------------------------------------------| 54H
|				CR2				|
|---------------------------------------------------------------| 50H

|-------------------------------+-------------------------------| 24H
|	Return EIP (32-bit) or CS:IP (16-bit)			|
|-------------------------------+-------------------------------| 20H+SS:(E)SP
</pre>

A 32-bit stack frame image is always presented, even for 16-bit
handlers, and the offset from SS:(E)SP to the expanded stack frame is
always 20H (32) regardless of the handler type.  The DS, ES, FS, and
GS registers are saved for both real and protected mode.  The client
can inspect the VM bit in EFLAGS to determine the mode at the point of
exception.  The CS field at SS:(E)SP+24H is zero if the handler is
running in 16-bit protected mode. <p>

The exception information bits at SS:(E)SP+32H have the following
meanings: <p>

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=4>

<tr> <th>Bit</th> <th colspan=2>Significance</th> </tr>

<tr> <td align=center rowspan=2>0</td>

<td align=center>0</td> <td align=left>exception occurred in the
client</td></tr>

<td align=center>1</td> <td align=left>exception occurred in the host
(most likely due to page fault or invalid selector passed to host in
an Int 31H call)</td></tr>

<tr> <td align=center rowspan=2>1</td>

<td align=center>0</td> <td align=left>exception can be retried</td></tr>

<td align=center>1</td> <td align=left>Exception cannot be retried,
handler should perform whatever cleanup is possible</td></tr>

<tr> <td align=center rowspan=2>2</td>

<td align=center>0</td> <td align=left>host exception should be
retried (invalid selector or page causing fault corrected by exception
handler, this is the default)</td></tr>

<td align=center>1</td> <td align=left>host exception is being
redirected somewhere other than a retry address</td></tr>

<tr> <td align=center>3</td><td colspan=2
align=left>reserved</td></tr>

</table><p>

Bits 0 through 2 of the exception information bits are relevant on
hosts which support the Exceptions Restartability capability (see <a
href="api/310401.html">Int 31H Function 0401H</a>).  Bits 0 and 1 of
the exception information bits are supplied to the client by the host.
The default state of bit 2 as set by the host is zero, and the client
may st the bit to 1 before returning from the exception handler.<p>

Bit 0-14 of the error code at SS:(E)SP+28H are the "virtual" DR6 on
debug (Int 1) exceptions, and correspond to debug breakpoint 0-14.  In
other words, if bits 0 and 2 are set in the error code field on an Int
1 exception, then debug watchpoints 0 and 2 have fired.  The handle
returned by the Set Debug Watchpoint (<a
href="api/310b00.html">Function 0B00H</a>) corresponds to the bit
number in the virtual DR6.  Bit 15 of the virtual DR6 is set (1) if
the Int 1 is due to the trap flag.  Breakpoints may be virtualized,
and there is no guarantee of correspondence with the actual hardware.
The provision for up to 15 breakpoints is made for future CPUs or
external debugging hardware (80386 and 80486 CPUs support only four
hardware breakpoints). <p>

The PTE and CR2 fields of the expanded stack frame at SS:(E)SP+50H and
54H respectively are only valid for page faults (Int 0EH).  Bits 0-7
of the PTE (page table entry) field are from the actual PTE and may be
virtualized by the host; the remaining bits of the PTE field are
undefined.  The CR2 field contains the linear address that caused the
fault. <p>

Exception handlers installed with <a href="api/310212.html">Functions
0212H</a> and <a href="api/310213.html">0213H</a> may terminate in any
of the following three ways:

<ul>

<li> <tt>RETF</tt> from the old-style stack frame (only modifications
to the old-style stack frame will be recognized and a client may not
use this type of return for real-mode exceptions);<p>

<li> Discard the old-style stack frame by adding 20H (32) to (E)SP,
then <tt>RETF</tt> from the new-style (expanded) stack frame);<p>

<li> <tt>FAR JUMP</tt> to previous owner of the exception (the previous
owner should never be <tt>CALL</tt>ed).<p>

</ul>

The fields at offsets 2CH through 4FH in the expanded stack frame may
be modified by an exception handler.  Note that the handler should
only modify the values in the particular frame (SS:(E)SP)+0 or
SS:(E)SP+20H) that it will use for the <tt>RETF</tt>.  Altered values
in the other frame are ignored by the DPMI host.  Real mode exceptions
do not have valid data in the old-style frame.  A real mode exception
handler must discard the old-style stack frame if it returns.<p>

<b>Example:</b> The following code illustrates how a client would
install its own exception handler for general protection (GP) faults.
The actual handler does nothing more than reach into the stack frame
and alter the return address, so that control within the application
restarts at a different point after the exception handler exits.

<pre>
prevgp	dd	0			; address of previous
					; GP fault handler

	.
	.				; this code is executed during
	.				; application initialization...
	mov	ax,0210h		; get address of previous
	mov	bl,13			; owner of GP fault vector
	<a href="api/310210.html">int	31h</a>
	mov	word ptr prevgp,dx	; save as far pointer
	mov	word ptr prevgp+2,cx

	mov	ax,0212h		; install our GP fault handler
	mov	bl,13
	mov	cx,cs			; CX:DX = handler address
	mov	dx,offset _TEXT:gpfisr
	<a href="api/310212.html">int	31h</a>
	jc	init9			; jump, couldn't install
	.				; continue with initialization
	.
	.

gpfisr proc far				; this is the actual exception
					; handler for GP faults
	add	sp,20h			; discard "old" stack frame
	push	bp			; point CS:IP in stack frmae to
	mov	bp,sp			; GP fault error message routine
	mov	word ptr [bp+0eh],offset _TEXT:	gpferr
	mov	word ptr [bp+12h],cs
	pop	bp
	ret				; now return from exception
gpfisr endp

gpferr proc near			; this routine executes after
					; GPFISR returns to DPMI host
	
	mov	ax,4c01h		; terminate DPMI client with
	int	21h			; nonzero return code

gpferr endp
</pre>
