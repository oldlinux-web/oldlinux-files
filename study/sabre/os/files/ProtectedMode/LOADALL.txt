       THE LOADALL INSTRUCTION        
                                      
                                      
In  Imphobia  Issue #8,  Walken/Impact
Studios  wrote  a nice  article  about
memory management.   However, for some
reason he seems to like flat-real-mode
(FRM)  which is in my belief a totally
wrong  way  of  programming  since FRM
requires a 'clean' boot.   Anyway, the
discussion   of   the  advantages  and
disadvantages  of using  FRM as oposed
to true  flat-model protected mode are
not  at issue here.   Besides, there's
too many coders who just blindly think
FRM or PMode  is better  whithout ever
having  performed some  serious tests.
For those who think PMode is better, I
strongly suggest  checking the 386/486
references  on segment  management and
memory access. For those who think FRM
is  better...   just  speed-test  your
program on a Pentium <g>.             
                                      
Some    info    about   the    LOADALL
instruction  first.    There's  a  286
LOADALL instruction and a 386/486/Pen-
tium  LOADALL  instruction,  they have
different  opcodes,  and work slightly
different.  Since no-one wants to code
a 286 protected mode program nowadays,
I won't cover  the 286 variant  of the
LOADALL instruction. Strangely however
some  of the BIOSes will 'emulate' the
286 variant,  by hooking  it into  the
"bad opcode" interrupt.    The LOADALL
instruction is not documented by intel
in their CPU reference guides. LOADALL
is  used  in   the  VDISK  program  by
Microsoft,  OS/2 and  Windows 95,  and
supposedly also in Windows NT.        
                                      
The 286 variant  has  opcode 0Fh, 05h.
The 386+ variant has  opcode 0Fh, 07h.
As said  before, any further reference
to  LOADALL  assumes the  386  variant
unless otherwise mentionned.          
                                      
LOADALL loads a 204-byte table pointed
to by ES:EDI into the registers.  Note
however,  that ES:EDI  must point to a
valid memory location layed out by the
current memory model, meaning.    When
in real mode,  ES points to a segment,
and  EDI  points  to an offset  within
that segment  (thus, only the lower 16
bit offset is used).    When in PMode,
ES  is  a selector,  and EDI an offset
within  that  selector  page.  When in
FRM, ES is a segment, and EDI a 32-bit
offset within that segment.           
                                      
The table layout is as follows.

The descriptor cache entries are:     
                                      
Byte  0     Must be 0                 
Byte  1     Access-rights byte,       
            like access-rights byte   
            in a descriptor           
Bytes 2-3   Must be 0                 
Bytes 4-7   32-bit base address       
            of the segment            
Bytes 8-11  32-bit segment limit      
                                      
I suggest aliging  the table on a page
boundary (16 bytes, or lower 4 bits of
the offset must be zero).   While this
is  not a requirement  for the 386 and
486,  it  may  be  a requirement  when
running   on  a   Pentium   (which  is
probably  why   a  pentium-patch   was
issued  for  Windows  95  for  running
DPMI-DOS programs).                   
Now...   something  the  speed  guru's
might be interested in...  how fast is
LOADALL.    Well.  according  to  some
tests I've done,  LOADALL clocks in at
about  105  clockcycles on a 386,  and
125 on a 486 which is bad.  But not so
bad if you take into account the usual
number  of clocks  it  take  to switch
from PMode to real and back.          
                                      
             RESTRICTIONS             
                                      
LOADALL  performs  no checking  on the
values loaded  into the registers,  so
no exception  will  occur  even  if an
illegal  value  is loaded.   Thus, the
processor can potential  be put into a
strange   state.     If   an   illegal
descriptor value  is set, no exception
occurs from  the execution of LOADALL.
An exception will occur, however, when
an  access  using  that descriptor  is
attempted.                            
                                      
LOADALL  can be executed  in protected
mode,  but only at the most privileged
level (level 0).  So  when  you  would
want  to  use  LOADALL  when  a memory
manager is installed,  you would first
have  to shut-down  the memory manager
by issuing a VCPI call to request ring
0 privileges.
