          The associated file (LIMEMS41.DOC) is a complete transcription of
          the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft (LIM) Expanded Memory Specification
          (EMS) Version 4.0, updated October 1987.  It can be printed by
          "COPY LIMEMS41.DOC PRN:"

          I created this transcription because of the difficulty I origin-
          ally had finding a copy of the document, because of the number of
          people who have subsequently expressed an interest in having
          access to a machine-readable copy of the specification, and,
          finally, because of the annoying number of typographical errors
          contained in the original and updated documents.

          This transcription is not an exact letter-for-letter duplicate of
          the original document.  Some minor changes were necessitated by
          the simple fact that the document's proportionally-spaced, multi-
          fonted typography and line drawings did not lend themselves to
          the generic fixed-spacing, single-fonted, non-graphical ASCII
          transcription I wanted to produce for general dissemination.

          Other minor changes were made to correct obvious typographical
          and grammatical errors, or to simply improve the visual aes-
          thetics of the presented material.

          In one area, however, I simply trashed their original material
          and substituted my own.  This area is the Index.  The original
          document contains an Index that is little more than a reformatt-
          ing of the Table of Contents.  As anyone who has ever indexed a
          large document knows, it is very difficult to produce an Index
          that is both complete AND easy to use.  I didn't have time to
          produce one that was both, so I aimed for the former.  In fact,
          the Index I have provided is more of an alphabetical listing of
          key words and phrases and the pages where they are referenced,
          than it is a more typical Index with its multi-level headings and
          subheadings.

          You should be able obtain a printed, 3-hole-punched, 5.5 x 8.5"
          copy of the original (and uncorrected) document directly from
          Intel by calling their "Information Department" at 1-800-538-3373
          and asking for a copy of the "LIM EMS 4.0 Developer's Kit."  It
          is available free of charge and mine arrived in about two weeks. 
          (European availability, however, is reported to be from poor to
          non-existent.)

          It is my intent to provide this transcription as a public
          service.  I am, therefore, releasing it into the public domain. 
          The original document has also been released into the public
          domain by Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft, though it remains their
          copyrighted property (I'm not quite sure how they manage to do
          that).

          I have tried as best I can to provide an accurate and corrected
          transcription of the original document.  It is inevitable,
          however, that some typographical errors have slipped through in
          spite of my hours of bleary-eyed proof reading.  For these errors
          I apologize and plead simple human frailty.

          Chapter 1
          INTRODUCTION


               Because even the maximum amount (640K bytes) of conventional
               memory isn't always enough for large application programs,
               Lotus Development Corporation, Intel Corporation, and Micro-
               soft Corporation created the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft (LIM)
               Expanded Memory Specification.

               The LIM Expanded Memory Specification defines the software
               interface between the Expanded Memory Manager (EMM) -- a
               device driver that controls and manages expanded memory --
               and application programs that use expanded memory.


          What is Expanded Memory?

               Expanded memory is memory beyond DOS's 640K-byte limit.  The
               LIM specification supports up to 32M bytes of expanded
               memory.  Because the 8086, 8088, and 80286 (in real mode)
               microprocessors can physically address only 1M bytes of
               memory, they access expanded memory through a window in
               their physical address range.  The next section explains how
               this is done.


          How Expanded Memory Works

               Expanded memory is divided into segments called logical
               pages.  These pages are typically 16K bytes of memory.  Your
               computer accesses logical pages through a physical block of
               memory called a page frame.  The page frame contains
               multiple physical pages, pages that the microprocessor can
               address directly.  Physical pages are also typically 16K
               bytes of memory.

               This page frame serves as a window into expanded memory. 
               Just as your computer screen is a window into a large
               spreadsheet, so the page frame is a window into expanded
               memory.

               A logical page of expanded memory can be mapped into (made
               to appear in) any one of the physical pages in the page
               frame.  Thus, a read or write to the physical page actually
               becomes a read or write to the associated logical page.  One
               logical page can be mapped into the page frame for each
               physical page.

               Figure 1-1 shows the relationship among the page frame,
               physical pages, and logical pages.

               The page frame is located above 640K bytes.  Normally, only
               video adapters, network cards, and similar devices exist
               between 640K and 1024K.

               This specification also defines methods for operating
               systems and environments to access expanded memory through
               physical pages below 640K bytes.  These methods are intended
               for operating system/environment developers only.

          WRITING PROGRAMS THAT USE EXPANDED MEMORY


               This chapter describes what every program must do to use
               expanded memory and describes more advanced techniques of
               using expanded memory.

               This chapter also lists programming guidelines you should
               follow when writing programs that use expanded memory and
               provides the listings of some example programs.


          What Every Program Must Do

               This section describes the steps every program must take to
               use expanded memory.

               In order to use expanded memory, applications must perform
               these steps in the following order:

               1.  Determine if EMM is installed.

               2.  Determine if enough expanded memory pages exist for your
                   application.  (Function 3)

               3.  Allocate expanded memory pages.  (Function 4, 18, or 27)

               4.  Get the page frame base address.  (Function 2)

               5.  Map in expanded memory pages.  (Function 5 or 17)

               6.  Read/write/execute data in expanded memory, just as if
                   it were conventional memory.

               7.  Return expanded memory pages to expand memory pool
                   before exiting.  (Function 6 or 18)

               Table 2-1 overviews the functions while Chapter 3 describes
               each of these functions in detail.  Example programs at the
               end of this chapter illustrate using expanded memory.

          Table 2-1.  The Basic Functions
          ----------------------------------------------------------------

          Function                        Description

          ----------------------------------------------------------------

             1         The Get Status Function returns a status code
                       indicating whether the memory manager hardware is
                       working correctly.

             2         The Get Page Frame Address function returns the
                       address where the 64K-byte page frame is located.

             3         The Get Unallocated Page Count function returns the
                       number of unallocated pages (pages available to your
                       program) and the total number of pages in expanded
                       memory.

             4         The Allocate Pages function allocates the number of
                       pages requested and assigns a unique EMM handle to
                       these pages.

             5         The Map/Unmap Handle Page function maps a logical
                       page to a specific physical page anywhere in the
                       mappable regions of system memory.

             6         The Deallocate Pages deallocates the logical pages
                       currently allocated to an EMM handle.

             7         The Get Version function returns the version number
                       of the memory manager software.

          ----------------------------------------------------------------



          Advanced Programming

               In addition to the basic functions, the Lotus/Intel/Micro-
               soft Expanded Memory Specification provides several advanced
               functions which enhance the capabilities of software that
               uses expanded memory.

               The following sections describe the advanced programming
               capabilities and list the advanced EMM functions.


          Note............................................................
               Before using the advanced functions, programs should first
               call Function 7 (Get Version) to determine whether the
               installed version of EMM supports these functions.

          Writing Programs That Use Expanded Memory                       5






          Saving The State of Mapping Hardware

               Some software (such as interrupt service routines, device
               drivers, and resident software) must save the current state
               of the mapping hardware, switch mapping contexts, manipulate
               sections of expanded memory, and restore the original
               context of the memory mapping hardware.  Use Functions 8 and
               9 or 15 and 16 to save the state of the hardware.


          Retrieving Handle and Page Counts

               Some utility programs need to keep track of how expanded
               memory is being used; use Functions 12 through 14 to do
               this.


          Mapping and Unmapping Multiple Pages

               Mapping multiple pages reduces the overhead an application
               must perform during mapping.  Function 17 lets a program map
               (or unmap) multiple pages at one time.

               In addition, you can map pages using segment addresses
               instead of physical pages.  For example, if the page frame
               base address is set to D000, you can map to either physical
               page 0 or segment D000.  Function 25 (Get Mappable Physical
               Address Array) returns a cross reference between all
               expanded memory physical pages and their corresponding
               segment values.


          Reallocating Pages

               Reallocating pages (Function 18) lets applications dynami-
               cally allocate expanded memory pages without acquiring
               another handle or obtain a handle without allocating pages. 
               Reallocating pages is an efficient means for applications to
               obtain and release expanded memory pages.


          Using Handles and Assigning Names to Handles

               This specification lets you associate a name with a handle,
               so a family of applications can share information in
               expanded memory.  For example, a software package consisting
               of a word processor, spreadsheet, and print spooler can
               share the same data among the different applications.  The
               print spooler could use a handle name to reference data that
               either the spreadsheet or word processor put in expanded
               memory and could check for data in a particular handle
               name's expanded memory pages.

          Writing Programs That Use Expanded Memory                       6






               Use Function 20 (Set Handle Name subfunction) to assign a
               handle name to an EMM handle or Function 21 (Search for
               Named Handle subfunction) to obtain the EMM handle as-
               sociated with the handle name.  In addition, you can use
               Function 14 (Get Handle Pages) to determine the number of
               expanded memory pages allocated to an EMM handle.


          Using Handle Attributes

               In addition to naming a handle, you can use Function 19 to
               associate an attribute (volatile or non-volatile) with a
               handle name.  A non-volatile attribute enables expanded
               memory pages to preserve their data through a warmboot. 
               With a volatile attribute, the data is not preserved.  The
               default attribute for handles is volatile.

               Because using this function depends on the capabilities of
               the expanded memory hardware installed in the system, you
               should use the Get Attribute Capability subfunction before
               attempting to assign an attribute to a handle's pages.


          Altering Page Maps and Jumping/Calling

               You can use Functions 22 (Alter Page Map & Jump) and 23
               (Alter Page Map & Call) to map a new set of values into the
               map registers and transfer program control to a specified
               address within expanded memory.  These functions can be used
               to load and execute code in expanded memory.  An application
               using this feature can significantly reduce the amount of
               conventional memory it requires.  Programs can load needed
               modules into expanded memory at run time and use Functions
               22 and 23 to transfer control to these modules.

               Using expanded memory to store code can improve program
               execution in many ways.  For example, sometimes programs
               need to be divided into small overlays because of conven-
               tional memory size limitations.  Overlays targeted for
               expanded memory can be very large because LIM EMS 4.0
               supports up to 32M bytes of expanded memory.  This method of
               loading overlays improves overall system performance by
               conserving conventional memory and eliminating conventional
               memory allocation errors.


          Moving or Exchanging Memory Regions

               Using Function 24 (Move/Exchange Memory Region), you can
               easily move and exchange data between conventional and
               expanded memory.  Function 24 can manipulate up to one
               megabyte of data with one function call.  Although applica-

          Writing Programs That Use Expanded Memory                       7






               tions can perform this operation without this function,
               having the expanded memory manager do it reduces the amount
               of overhead for the application.

               In addition, this function checks for overlapping regions
               and performs all the necessary mapping, preserving the
               mapping context from before the exchange/move call.


          Getting the Amount of Mappable Memory

               Function 25 enables applications to determine the total
               amount of mappable memory the hardware/system currently
               supports.  Not all expanded memory boards supply the same
               number of physical pages (map registers).

               The Get Mappable Physical Address Array Entries subfunction
               returns the total number of physical pages the expanded
               memory hardware/system is capable of supporting.  The Get
               Mappable Physical Array subfunction returns a cross refer-
               ence between physical page numbers and the actual segment
               address for each of the physical pages.


          Operating System Functions

               In addition to the functions for application programs, this
               specification defines functions for operating systems/en-
               vironments.  These functions can be disabled at any time by
               the operating system/environment, so programs should not
               depend on their presence.  Applications that avoid this
               warning and use these functions run a great risk of being
               incompatible with other programs, including the operating
               system.

             8         The Save Page Map saves the contents of the page
                       mapping registers from all expanded memory boards in
                       an internal save area.

             9         The Restore Page Map function restores (from an
                       internal save area) the page mapping register
                       contents on the expanded memory boards for a
                       particular EMM handle.

             10        Reserved.

             11        Reserved.

             12        The Get Handle Count function returns the number of
                       open EMM handles in the system.

             13        The Get Handle Pages function returns the number of
                       pages allocated to a specific EMM handle.

             14        The Get All Handle Pages function returns an array
                       of the active EMM handles and the number of pages
                       allocated to each one.

             15        The Get/Set Page Map subfunction saves or restores
                       the mapping context for all mappable memory regions
                       (conventional and expanded) in a destination array
                       which the application supplies.

             16        The Get/Set Partial Page Map subfunction provides a
                       mechanism for saving a partial mapping context for
                       specific mappable memory regions in a system.

             17        The Map/Unmap Multiple Handle Pages function can, in
                       a single invocation, map (or unmap) logical pages
                       into as many physical pages as the system supports.

             18        The Reallocate Pages function can increase or
                       decrease the amount of expanded memory allocated to
                       a handle.

             19        The Get/Set Handle Attribute function allows an
                       application program to determine and set the
                       attribute associated with a handle.

          Function                        Description

          ----------------------------------------------------------------

             20        The Get/Set Handle Name function gets the eight
                       character name currently assigned to a handle and
                       can assign an eight character name to a handle.

             21        The Get Handle Directory function returns informa-
                       tion about active handles and the names assigned to
                       each.

             22        The Alter Page Map & Jump function alters the memory
                       mapping context and transfers control to the
                       specified address.

             23        The Alter Page Map & Call function alters the speci-
                       fied mapping context and transfers control to the
                       specified address.  A return can then restore the
                       context and return control to the caller.

             24        The Move/Exchange Memory Region function copies or
                       exchanges a region of memory from conventional to
                       conventional memory, conventional to expanded
                       memory, expanded to conventional memory, or expanded
                       to expanded memory.

             25        The Get Mappable Physical Address Array function
                       returns an array containing the segment address and
                       physical page number for each mappable physical page
                       in a system.

             26        The Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information
                       function returns an array containing the hardware
                       capabilities of the expanded memory system.

             27        The Allocate Standard/Raw Pages function allocates
                       the number of standard or non-standard size pages
                       that the operating system requests and assigns a
                       unique EMM handle to these pages.

             28        The Alternate Map Register Set function enables an
                       application to simulate alternate sets of hardware
                       mapping registers.

             29        The Prepare Expanded Memory Hardware for Warm Boot
                       function prepares the expanded memory hardware for
                       an "impending" warm boot.

          Programming Guidelines

               The following section contains guidelines for programmers
               writing applications that use EMM.

               o   Do not put a program's stack in expanded memory.

               o   Do not replace interrupt 67h.  This is the interrupt
                   vector the EMM uses.  Replacing interrupt 67h could
                   result in disabling the Expanded Memory Manager.

               o   Do not map into conventional memory address space your
                   application doesn't own.  Applications that use the EMM
                   to swap into conventional memory space, must first
                   allocate this space from the operating system.  If the
                   operating system is not aware that a region of memory it
                   manages is in use, it will think it is available.  This
                   could have disastrous results.  EMM should not be used
                   to "allocate" conventional memory.  DOS is the proper
                   manager of conventional memory space.  EMM should only
                   be used to swap data in conventional memory space
                   previously allocated from DOS.

               o   Applications that plan on using data aliasing in
                   expanded memory must check for the presence of expanded
                   memory hardware.  Data aliasing occurs when mapping one
                   logical page into two or more mappable segments.  This
                   makes one 16K-byte expanded memory page appear to be in
                   more than one 16K-byte memory address space.  Data
                   aliasing is legal and sometimes useful for applications.

                   Software-only expanded memory emulators cannot perform
                   data aliasing.  A simple way to distinguish software
                   emulators from actual expanded memory hardware is to
                   attempt data aliasing and check the results.  For
                   example, map one logical page into four physical pages. 
                   Write to physical page 0.  Read physical pages 1-3 to
                   see if the data is there as well.  If the data appears
                   in all four physical pages, then expanded memory
                   hardware is installed in the system, and data aliasing
                   is supported.

               o   Applications should always return expanded memory pages
                   to the expanded memory manager upon termination.  These
                   pages will be made available for other applications.  If
                   unneeded pages are not returned to the expanded memory
                   manager, the system could "run out" of expanded memory
                   pages or expanded memory handles.

               o   Terminate and stay resident programs (TSR's) should
                   ALWAYS save the state of the map registers before
                   changing them.  Since TSR's may interrupt other programs

                   which may be using expanded memory, they must not change
                   the state of the page mapping registers without first
                   saving them.  Before exiting, TSR's must restore the
                   state of the map registers.

                   The following sections describe the three ways to save
                   and restore the state of the map registers.

                   1.  Save Page Map and Restore Page Map (Functions 8 and
                       9).  This is the simplest of the three methods.  The
                       EMM saves the map register contents in its own data
                       structures -- the application does not need to
                       provide extra storage locations for the mapping
                       context.  The last mapping context to be saved,
                       under a particular handle, will be restored when a
                       call to Restore Page Map is issued with the same
                       handle.  This method is limited to one mapping
                       context for each handle and saves the context for
                       only LIM standard 64K-byte page frames.

                   2.  Get/Set Page Map (Function 15).  This method
                       requires the application to allocate space for the
                       storage array.  The EMM saves the mapping context in
                       an array whose address is passed to the EMM.  When
                       restoring the mapping context with this method, an
                       application passes the address of an array which
                       contains a previously stored mapping context.

                       This method is preferable if an application needs to
                       do more than one save before a restore.  It provides
                       a mechanism for switching between more than one
                       mapping context.

                   3.  Get/Set Partial Page Map (Function 16).  This method
                       provides a way for saving a partial mapping context. 
                       It should be used when the application does not need
                       to save the context of all mappable memory.  This
                       function also requires that the storage array be
                       part of the application's data.

               o   All functions using pointers to data structures must
                   have those data structures in memory which will not be
                   mapped out.  Functions 22 and 23 (Alter Map & Call and
                   Alter Map & Jump) are the only exceptions.

          Examples

               This section lists four example programs that demonstrate
               the use of expanded memory.


          Example 1

               This program was written using the Microsoft C compiler
               Version 3.0.  EMM function calls are made with the int86
               function found in the dos.h library.  To create an ex-

          #define TRUE                    1
          #define FALSE                   0

          union REGS input_regs, output_regs;
          struct SREGS segment_regs;

          Example 2

          This program shows you how to use the basic functions of the LIM
          Expanded Memory Specification with Turbo Pascal.  The program
          does the following:

               1.  Makes sure the LIM Expanded Memory Manager (EMM) has
                   been installed.

               2.  Displays the version number of the EMM.

               3.  Determines if there are enough pages of memory for the
                   program.  It then displays the total number of EMM pages
                   present in the system and the number available for use.

               4.  Requests the desired number of pages from the EMM.

               5.  Maps a logical page into one of the physical pages.

               6.  Displays the base address of our EMM memory page frame. 
                   Performs a simple read/write test on the EMM memory.

               7.  Returns the EMM memory given to us back to the EMM.

               8.  Exits.

          All the calls are structured to return the result or error code
          of the Expanded Memory function performed as an integer.  If the
          error code is not zero, an error has occurred, a simple error
          procedure is called, and the program terminates.

          Chapter 3
          EMM FUNCTIONS


               This chapter provides you with a standardized set of
               expanded memory functions.  Because they are standardized,
               you avoid potential compatibility problems with other
               expanded memory programs that also adhere to the memory
               manager specification.  Programs that deal directly with the
               hardware or that don't adhere to this specification will be
               incompatible.

               Table 3-1 presents a sequential list of the EMM functions. 
               The remainder of this chapter provides detailed descriptions
               of each function.

          Function 1. Get Status



          PURPOSE

               The Get Status function returns a status code indicating
               whether the memory manager is present and the hardware is
               working correctly.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AH = 40h
                   Contains the Get Status Function.

          STATUS

               AH = 0   SUCCESSFUL.
                   The manager is present in the system, and the hardware
                   is working correctly.

               AH = 80h   NON-RECOVERABLE.
                   The manager detected a malfunction in the memory manager
                   software.

               AH = 81h   NON-RECOVERABLE.
                   The manager detected a malfunction in the expanded
                   memory hardware.

               AH = 84h   NON-RECOVERABLE.
                   The function code passed to the memory manager is not
                   defined.

          Function 2. Get Page Frame Address



          PURPOSE

               The Get Page Frame Address function returns the segment
               address where the page frame is located.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AH = 41h
                   Contains the Get Page Frame Address function.


          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               BX = page frame segment address
                   Contains the segment address of the page frame.

          Function 4. Allocate Pages



               The Allocate Pages function allocates the number of pages
               requested and assigns a unique EMM handle to these pages. 
               The EMM handle owns these pages until the application
               deallocates them.

               Handles which are assigned using this function will have
               16K-byte pages, the size of a standard expanded memory page. 
               If the expanded memory board hardware isn't able to supply
               16K-byte pages, it will emulate them by combining multiple
               non-standard size pages to form a single 16K-byte page.  All
               application programs and functions that use the handles this
               function returns will deal with 16K-byte pages.

               The numeric value of the handles the EMM returns are in the
               range of 1 to 254 decimal (0001h to 00FEh).  The OS handle
               (handle value 0) is never returned by the Allocate Pages
               function.  Also, the uppermost byte of the handle will be
               zero and cannot be used by the application.  A memory
               manager should be able to supply up to 255 handles, includ-
               ing the OS handle.  An application can use Function 21 to
               find out how many handles an EMM supports.

               Allocating zero pages to a handle is not valid.  If an
               application needs to allocate 0 pages to a handle it should
               use Function 27 (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction)
               provided for this purpose.

          Note............................................................
               This note affects expanded memory manager implementors and
               operating system developers only.  Applications should not
               use the following characteristics of the memory manager.  An
               application violating this rule will be incompatible with
               future versions of Microsoft's operating systems and
               environments.

               To be compatible with this specification, an expanded memory
               manager will provide a special handle which is available to
               the operating system only.  This handle will have a value of
               0000h and will have a set of pages allocated to it when the
               expanded memory manager driver installs.  The pages that the
               memory manager will automatically allocate to handle 0000h
               are those that backfill conventional memory.  Typically,
               this backfill occurs between addresses 40000h (256K) and
               9FFFFh (640K).  However, the range can extend below and
               above this limit if the hardware and memory manager have the
               capability.



          EMM Functions                                                  42






          Function 4. Allocate Pages



               An operating system won't have to invoke Function 4 to
               obtain this handle because it can assume the handle already
               exists and is available for use immediately after the
               expanded memory device driver installs.  When an operating
               system wants to use this handle, it uses the special handle
               value of 0000h.  The operating system will be able to invoke
               any EMM function using this special handle value.  To
               allocate pages to this handle, the operating system need
               only invoke Function 18 (Reallocate Pages).

               There are two special cases for this handle:

               1.  Function 4 (Allocate Pages).  This function must never
                   return zero as a handle value.  Applications must always
                   invoke Function 4 to allocate pages and obtain a handle
                   which identifies the pages which belong to it.  Since
                   Function 4 never returns a handle value of zero, an
                   application will never gain access to this special
                   handle.

               2.  Function 6 (Deallocate Pages).  If the operating system
                   uses it to deallocate the pages which are allocated to
                   this special handle, the pages the handle owns will be
                   returned to the manager for use.  But the handle will
                   not be available for reassignment.  The manager should
                   treat a deallocate pages function request for this
                   handle the same as a reallocate pages function request,
                   where the number of pages to reallocate to this handle
                   is zero.

          Function 5. Map/Unmap Handle Pages



          PURPOSE

               The Map/Unmap Handle Page function maps a logical page at a
               specific physical page anywhere in the mappable regions of
               system memory.  The lowest valued physical page numbers are
               associated with regions of memory outside the conventional
               memory range.  Use Function 25 (Get Mappable Physical
               Address Array) to determine which physical pages within a
               system are mappable and determine the segment addresses
               which correspond to a specific physical page number. 
               Function 25 provides a cross reference between physical page
               numbers and segment addresses.

               This function can also unmap physical pages, making them
               inaccessible for reading or writing.  You unmap a physical
               page by setting its associated logical page to FFFFh.

               You might unmap an entire set of mapped pages, for example,
               before loading and executing a program.  Doing so ensures
               the loaded program, if it accesses expanded memory, won't
               access the pages your program has mapped.  However, you must
               save the mapped context before you unmap the physical pages. 
               This enables you to restore it later so you can access the
               memory you mapped there.  To save the mapping context, use
               Function 8, 15, or 16.  To restore the mapping context, use
               Function 9, 15, or 16.

               The handle determines what type of pages are being mapped. 
               Logical pages allocated by Function 4 and Function 27
               (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction) are referred to as
               pages and are 16K bytes long.  Logical pages allocated by
               Function 27 (Allocate Raw Pages subfunction) are referred to
               as raw pages and might not be the same size as logical
               pages.

                   are numbered zero-relative.  The logical page must be in
                   the range zero through (number of pages allocated to the
                   EMM handle - 1).  However, if BX contains logical page

               Deallocate Pages deallocates the logical pages currently
               allocated to an EMM handle.  Only after the application
               deallocates these pages can other applications use them. 
               When a handle is deallocated, its name is set to all ASCII
               nulls (binary zeros).

          Note............................................................
               A program must perform this function before it exits to DOS. 
               If it doesn't, no other programs can use these pages or the
               EMM handle.  This means that a program using expanded memory
               should trap critical errors and control-break if there is a
               chance that the program will have allocated pages when
               either of these events occur.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AH = 45h
                   Contains the Deallocate Pages function.

               DX = handle

                   The memory manager detected a save or restore page
                   mapping context error (Function 8 or 9).  There is a
                   page mapping register state in the save area for the
                   specified EMM handle.  Save Page Map (Function 8) placed
                   it there and a subsequent Restore Page Map (Function 9)
                   has not removed it.

                   If you have saved the mapping context, you must restore
                   it before you deallocate the EMM handle's pages.

          Function 7. Get Version



          PURPOSE

               The Get Version function returns the version number of the
               memory manager software.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AH = 46h
                   Contains the Get Version function.


          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               AL = version number
                   Contains the memory manager's version number in binary
                   coded decimal (BCD) format.  The upper four bits contain
                   the integer digit of the version number.  The lower four
                   bits contain the fractional digit of version number. 
                   For example, version 4.0 is represented like this:

                                      0100 0000
                                        /   \
                                       4  .  0

                   When checking for a version number, an application
                   should check for a version number or greater.  Vendors
                   may use the fractional digit to indicate enhancements or
                   corrections to their memory managers.  Therefore, to
                   allow for future versions of memory managers, an
                   application shouldn't depend on an exact version number.

          Function 8. Save Page Map



          PURPOSE

               Save Page Map saves the contents of the page mapping
               registers on all expanded memory boards in an internal save
               area.  The function is typically used to save the memory
               mapping context of the EMM handle that was active when a
               software or hardware interrupt occurred.  (See Function 9,
               Restore Page Map, for the restore operation.)

               If you're writing a resident program, an interrupt service
               routine, or a device driver that uses expanded memory, you
               must save the state of the mapping hardware.  You must save
               this state because application software using expanded
               memory may be running when your program is invoked by a
               hardware interrupt, a software interrupt, or DOS.

               The Save Page Map function requires the EMM handle that was
               assigned to your resident program, interrupt service
               routine, or device driver at the time it was initialized. 
               This is not the EMM handle that the application software was
               using when your software interrupted it.

               The Save Page Map function saves the state of the map
               registers for only the 64K-byte page frame defined in
               versions 3.x of this specification.  Since all applications
               written to LIM versions 3.x require saving the map register
               state of only this 64K-byte page frame, saving the entire
               mapping state for a large number of mappable pages would be
               inefficient use of memory.  Applications that use a mappable
               memory region outside the LIM 3.x page frame should use
               Function 15 or 16 to save and restore the state of the map
               registers.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AH = 47h
                   Contains the Save Page Map function.

               DX = handle

                   service routine that's servicing the software or
                   hardware interrupt.  The interrupt service routine needs
                   to save the state of the page mapping hardware before
                   mapping any pages.

          Function 9. Restore Page Map



          PURPOSE

               The Restore Page Map function restores the page mapping
               register contents on the expanded memory boards for a
               particular EMM handle.  This function lets your program
               restore the contents of the mapping registers its EMM handle
               saved.  (See Function 8, Save Page Map for the save opera-
               tion.)

               If you're writing a resident program, an interrupt service
               routine, or a device driver that uses expanded memory, you
               must restore the mapping hardware to the state it was in
               before your program took over.  You must save this state
               because application software using expanded memory might
               have been running when your program was invoked.

               The Restore Page Map function requires the EMM handle that
               was assigned to your resident program, interrupt service
               routine, or device driver at the time it was initialized. 
               This is not the EMM handle that the application software was
               using when your software interrupted it.

               The Restore Page Map function restores the state of the map
               registers for only the 64K-byte page frame defined in
               versions 3.x of this specification.  Since all applications
               written to LIM versions 3.x require restoring the map
               register state of only this 64K-byte page frame, restoring
               the entire mapping state for a large number of mappable
               pages would be inefficient use of memory.  Applications that
               use a mappable memory region outside the LIM 3.x page frame
               should use Function 15 or 16 to save and restore the state
               of the map registers.

          PURPOSE

               The Get All Handle Pages function returns an array of the
               open EMM handles and the number of pages allocated to each
               one.

               ES:DI = pointer to handle_page
                   Contains a pointer to an array of structures where a
                   copy of all open EMM handles and the number of pages
                   allocated to each will be stored.  Each structure has
                   these two members:

                   .emm_handle
                       The first member is a word which contains the value
                       of the open EMM handle.  The values of the handles
                       this function returns will be in the range of 0 to
                       255 decimal (0000h to 00FFh).  The uppermost byte of
                       the handle is always zero.

                   .pages_alloc_to_handle
                       The second member is a word which contains the
                       number of pages allocated to the open EMM handle.

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               BX = total_open_emm_handles
                   Contains the number of open EMM handles (including the
                   operating system handle [0]).  The number cannot be zero
                   because the operating system handle is always active and
                   cannot be deallocated.  This number will not exceed 255.

          Function 15. Get/Set Page Map
          Get Page Map subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Get Page Map subfunction saves the mapping context for
               all mappable memory regions (conventional and expanded) by
               copying the contents of the mapping registers from each
               expanded memory board to a destination array.  The applica-
               tion must pass a pointer to the destination array.  This
               subfunction doesn't require an EMM handle.

               Use this function instead of Functions 8 and 9 if you need
               to save or restore the mapping context but don't want (or
               have) to use a handle.

               for all mappable memory regions (conventional and expanded)
               by copying the contents of a source array into the mapping
               registers on each expanded memory board in the system.  The
               application must pass a pointer to the source array.  This
               subfunction doesn't require an EMM handle.

               Use this function instead of Functions 8 and 9 if you need

          Function 15. Get/Set Page Map
          Get & Set Page Map subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Get & Set Page Map subfunction simultaneously saves a
               current mapping context and restores a previous mapping
               context for all mappable memory regions (both conventional
               and expanded).  It first copies the contents of the mapping
               registers from each expanded memory board in the system into
               a destination array.  (The application must pass a pointer
               to the destination array.)  Then, the subfunction copies the
               contents of a source array into the mapping registers on
               each of the expanded memory boards.  (The application must
               pass a pointer to the source array.)

               Use this function instead of Functions 8 and 9 if you need
               to save or restore the mapping context but don't want (or
               have) to use a handle.

                   Contains a pointer to the source array address in
                   segment:offset format.  The contents of this array will
                   be copied into the map registers.  The application must
                   point to an array which contains the mapping register
                   state.  This address is required only for the Set or Get

                   Contains the Get Size of Page Map Save Array subfunc-
                   tion.  The size of this array depends on how the
                   expanded memory system is configured and how the
                   expanded memory manager is implemented.  Therefore, the
                   size must be determined after the memory manager is
                   loaded.

          Function 16. Get/Set Partial Page Map
          Get Partial Page Map subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Get Partial Page Map subfunction saves a partial mapping
               context for specific mappable memory regions in a system. 
               Because this function saves only a subset of the entire
               mapping context, it uses much less memory for the save area
               and may be potentially faster than Function 15.  The
               subfunction does this by copying the contents of selected
               mapping registers from each expanded memory board to a
               destination array.

               The application must pass a pair of pointers.  The first
               points to a structure which specifies which mappable
               segments to save; the second points to the destination
               array.

               Use this function instead of Functions 8 and 9 if you need
               to save or restore the mapping context but don't want (or
               have) to use a handle.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

                   those mappable memory regions which are to have their
                   mapping context saved.  The structure members are
                   described below.

                   .mappable_segment_count
                       The first member is a word which specifies the
                       number of members in the word array which immediate-
                       ly follows it.  This number should not exceed the
                       number of mappable segments in the system.

                   .mappable_segment
                       The second member is a word array which contains the
                       segment addresses of the mappable memory regions
                       whose mapping contexts are to be saved.  The segment
                       address must be a mappable segment.  Use Function 25

          Function 16. Get/Set Partial Page Map
          Set Partial Page Map subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Set Partial Page Map subfunction provides a mechanism
               for restoring the mapping context for a partial mapping
               context for specific mappable memory regions in a system. 
               Because this function restores only a subset of the entire
               mapping context and not the entire systems mapping context,
               it uses much less memory for the save area and is potential-
               ly faster than Function 15.  The subfunction does this by
               copying the contents of the source array to selected mapping
               registers on each expanded memory board.  The application
               passes a pointer to the source array.

               Use this function instead of Functions 8 and 9 if you need
               to save or restore the mapping context but don't want (or
               have) to use a handle.

          Function 17. Map/Unmap Multiple Handle Pages



          PURPOSE

               This function can, in a single invocation, map (or unmap)
               logical pages into as many physical pages as the system
               supports.  Consequently, it has less execution overhead than
               mapping pages one at a time.  For applications which do a
               lot of page mapping, this is the preferred mapping method.


          Mapping Multiple Pages

               The handle passed to this function determines what type of
               logical pages are being mapped.  Logical pages that Function
               4 and Function 27 (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction)
               allocate are referred to as pages and are 16K bytes. 
               Logical pages that Function 27 (Allocate Raw Pages subfunc-
               tion) allocates are referred to as raw pages and might not
               be the same size as the pages Function 4 and Function 27
               (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction) allocate.


          Unmapping Multiple Pages

               This function can make specific physical pages unavailable
               for reading or writing.  A logical page which is unmapped
               from a specific physical page cannot be read or written from
               that physical page.  The logical page which is unavailable
               (unmapped) can be made available again by mapping it, or a
               new logical page, at the physical page that was unmapped. 
               Unmapping a physical page is accomplished by setting the
               logical page it is associated with to FFFFh.

               You might unmap an entire set of mapped pages, for example,
               before loading and executing a program.  This ensures that
               the loaded program won't be able to access the pages your
               program has mapped.  However, you must save the mapping
               context before you unmap the physical pages.  This enables
               you to restore it later so that you may access the memory
               you had mapped there.  You can save the mapping context with
               Functions 8, 15, or 16.  You can restore the mapping context
               with Functions 9, 15, or 16.


          Mapping and Unmapping Multiple Pages Simultaneously

               Both mapping and unmapping pages can be done in the same
               invocation.


          EMM Functions                                                  80






          Function 17. Map/Unmap Multiple Handle Pages



               Mapping or unmapping no pages is not considered an error. 
               If a request to map or unmap zero pages is made, nothing is
               done and no error is returned.


          Alternate Mapping and Unmapping Methods

               You can map or unmap pages using two methods.  Both methods
               produce identical results.

               1.  The first method specifies both a logical page and a
                   physical page at which the logical page is to be mapped. 
                   This method is an extension of Function 5 (Map Handle
                   Page).

               2.  The second method specifies both a logical page and a
                   corresponding segment address at which the logical page
                   is to be mapped.  While this is functionally the same as
                   the first method, it may be easier to use the actual
                   segment address of a physical page than to use a number
                   which only represents its location.  The memory manager
                   verifies whether the specified segment address falls on
                   the boundary of a mappable physical page.  The manager
                   then translates the segment address passed to it into
                   the necessary internal representation to map the pages.

               DX = handle
                   Contains the EMM handle.

               CX = log_to_phys_map_len
                   Contains the number of entries in the array.  For
                   example, if the array contained four pages to map or
                   unmap, then CX would contain 4.  The number in CX should
                   not exceed the number of mappable pages in the system.

               DS:SI = pointer to log_to_phys_map array
                   Contains a pointer to an array of structures that
                   contains the information necessary to map the desired
                   pages.  The array is made up of the following two
                   elements:

                   .log_page_number
                       The first member is a word which contains the number
                       of the logical page which is to be mapped.  Logical
                       pages are numbered zero-relative, so the number for
                       a logical page can only range from zero to (maximum
                       number of logical pages allocated to the handle -
                       1).

                       If the logical page number is set to FFFFh, the
                       physical page associated with it is unmapped rather
                       than mapped.  Unmapping a physical page makes it
                       inaccessible for reading or writing.

                   .phys_page_number
                       The second member is a word which contains the
                       number of the physical page at which the logical
                       page is to be mapped.  Physical pages are numbered
                       zero-relative, so the number for a physical page can
                       only range from zero to (maximum number of physical
                       pages supported in the system - 1).

          Function 18. Reallocate Pages



          PURPOSE

               This function allows an application program to increase or
               decrease (reallocate) the number of logical pages allocated
               to an EMM handle.  There are four reallocation cases of
               interest:

               1.  A reallocation count of zero.  The handle assigned to
                   the application remains assigned and is still available
                   for use by the application.  The memory manager won't
                   reassign the handle to any other application.  However,
                   the handle will have any currently allocated pages
                   returned to the memory manager.  The application must
                   invoke the Deallocate Pages function (Function 6) before
                   returning to DOS, or the handle will remain assigned and
                   no other application will be able to use it.

               2.  A reallocation count equal to the current allocation
                   count.  This is not treated as an error, and a success-
                   ful status is returned.

               3.  A reallocation count greater than the current allocation
                   count.  The memory manager will attempt to add new pages
                   to those pages already allocated to the specified EMM
                   handle.  The number of new pages added is the difference
                   between the reallocation count and the current alloca-
                   tion count.  The sequence of logical pages allocated to
                   the EMM handle remains continuous after this operation. 
                   The newly allocated pages have logical page numbers
                   which begin where the previously allocated pages ended,
                   and continue in ascending sequence.

               4.  A reallocation count less than the current allocation
                   count.  The memory manager will attempt to subtract some
                   of the currently allocated pages and return them to the
                   memory manager.  The number of old pages subtracted is
                   the difference between the current allocation count and
                   the re-allocation count.  The pages are subtracted from
                   the end of the sequence of pages currently allocated to
                   the specified EMM handle.  The sequence of logical pages
                   allocated to the EMM handle remains continuous after
                   this operation.

          Function 18. Reallocate Pages



          The handle determines what type of logical pages are being
          reallocated.  Logical pages which were originally allocated with
          Function 4 or Function 27 (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction)
          are called pages and are 16K bytes long.  Logical pages which
          were allocated with Function 27 (Allocate Raw Pages subfunction)
          are called raw pages and might not be the same size as pages
          allocated with Function 4.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AH = 51h
                   Contains the Reallocate Handle Pages function.

               DX = handle
                   Contains the EMM handle.

               BX = reallocation_count
                   Contains the total number of pages this handle should
                   have allocated to it after this function is invoked.


          RESULTS

               BX = number of pages allocated to handle after reallocation
                   Contains the number of pages now allocated to the EMM
                   handle after the pages have been added or subtracted. 
                   If the status returned is not zero, the value in BX is
                   equal to the number of pages allocated to the handle
                   prior to the invocation of this function.  This informa-
                   tion can be used to verify that the request generated
                   the expected results.

                   The number of unallocated pages is insufficient for the
                   new allocation request.  The program can recover from
                   this condition by either requesting again when addition-
                   al pages are available or specifying fewer pages.

          Function 19. Get/Set Handle Attribute



          Design Considerations

               This function is an option which will probably not be
               available in a typical expanded memory manager, system, or
               memory board.  Most personal computer systems disable memory
               refresh signals for a considerable period during a warm
               boot.  This can corrupt some of the data in memory boards,
               even though there is no problem with the design of the
               memory board, its operation, or the memory chips.  This
               memory refresh deficiency is present in the software design
               of the ROM BIOS in most personal computer systems.

               The majority of memory board designs, chip types, or
               personal computer systems won't be able to support the non-
               volatility feature.  The reason that this ROM BIOS deficien-
               cy is not evident in the conventional or extended memory
               area is that the ROM BIOS always initializes this area
               during a warm boot.  Memory data integrity is not a problem
               with the conventional or extended memory region, because it
               isn't physically possible to have data retained there across
               a warm boot event -- the ROM BIOS sets it to zero.

               Consequently, expanded memory board manufacturers should not
               supply this function unless their board can guarantee the
               integrity of data stored in the board's memory during a warm
               boot.  Generally, this means the memory board has an
               independent memory refresh controller which does not depend
               on the system board's memory refresh.

               If the expanded memory manager, system, or memory board
               cannot support this feature, it should return the not
               supported status described in the function.

          Get Handle Attribute subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This subfunction returns the attribute associated with a
               handle.  The attributes are volatile or non-volatile. 
               Handles with non-volatile attributes enable the memory
               manager to save the contents of a handle's pages between
               warm boots.  However, this function may be disabled with a
               user option or may not be supported by the memory board or
               system hardware.

               If the handle's attribute has been set to non-volatile, the
               handle, its name (if it is assigned one), and the contents
               of the pages allocated to the handle are all maintained
               after a warm boot.

          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               AL = handle attribute
                   Contains the EMM handle's attribute.  The only at-
                   tributes a handle may have are volatile or non-volatile. 
                   A value of zero indicates the handle is volatile.  A
                   value of one indicates that the handle is non-volatile.

          PURPOSE

               This subfunction can be used to modify the attribute which a
               handle has associated with it.  The attributes which a
               handle may have are volatile or non-volatile.  The non-
               volatile attribute enables the EMM to save the contents of a
               handle's pages between warm boots.  However, this function
               may be disabled with a user option or may not be supported
               by the memory board or system hardware.

               If the handle's attribute has been set to non-volatile, the
               handle, its name (if it is assigned one), and the contents
               of the pages allocated to the handle are all maintained
               after a warm boot.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5201h
                   Contains the Set Handle Attribute function.

               DX = handle
                   Contains the EMM handle.

               BL = new handle attribute
                   Contains the handle's new attribute.  A value of zero
                   indicates that the handle should be made volatile.  A
                   value of one indicates that the handle should be made
                   non-volatile.

                   A volatile handle attribute instructs the memory manager
                   to deallocate both the handle and the pages allocated to
                   it after a warm boot.  If all handles have the volatile
                   attribute (the default attribute) at warm boot, the
                   handle directory will be empty and all of expanded
                   memory will be initialized to zero immediately after a
                   warm boot.

          Function 20. Get/Set Handle Name
          Get Handle Name subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This subfunction gets the eight character name currently
               assigned to a handle.  There is no restriction on the
               characters which may be used in the handle name (that is,
               anything from 00h through FFh).

               The handle name is initialized to ASCII nulls (binary zeros)
               three times:  when the memory manager is installed, when a
               handle is allocated, and when a handle is deallocated.  A
               handle with a name which is all ASCII nulls, by definition,
               has no name.  When a handle is assigned a name, at least one
               character in the name must be a non-null character in order
               to distinguish it from a handle without a name.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5300h
                   Contains the Get Handle Name function.

          Function 20. Get/Set Handle Name
          Set Handle Name subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This subfunction assigns an eight character name to a
               handle.  There is no restriction on the characters which may
               be used in the handle name.  The full range of values may be
               assigned to each character in a name (that is, 00h through
               FFh).

               At installation, all handles have their name initialized to
               ASCII nulls (binary zeros).  A handle with a name consisting
               of all ASCII nulls has no name.  When a handle is assigned a
               name, at least one character in the name must be a non-null
               character in order to distinguish it from a handle without a
               name.  No two handles may have the same name.

               A handle can be renamed at any time by setting the handle's
               name to a new value.  A handle can have its name removed by
               setting the handle's name to all ASCII nulls.  When a handle
               is deallocated, its name is removed (set to ASCII nulls).

               AX = 5301h
                   Contains the Set Handle Name function.

          Function 21. Get Handle Directory
          Get Handle Directory subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This function returns an array which contains all active
               handles and the names associated with each.  Handles which
               have not been assigned names have a default name of all
               ASCII nulls (binary zeros).  When a handle is first allo-
               cated, or when all the pages belonging to a handle are
               deallocated (that is, an open handle is closed), its default
               name is set to ASCII nulls.  It takes a subsequent assign-
               ment of a name for a handle to have a name after it has been
               opened.  The full range of values may be assigned to each
               character in a name (that is, 00h through FFh).

               The number of bytes required by the array is:

                           10 bytes * total number of handles

               The maximum size of this array is:

                           (10 bytes/entry) * 255 entries = 2550 bytes.

                   as many entries in the array as there are open EMM
                   handles.  The structure consists of the following
                   elements:

                       The first member is a word which contains the value
                       of the open EMM handle.

               AL = number of entries in the handle_dir array
                   Contains the number of entries in the handle directory
                   array.  This is also the same as the number of open
                   handles.  For example, if only one handle is active, AL
                   will contain a one.

          PURPOSE

               This subfunction searches the handle name directory for a

               found, this subfunction returns the handle number associated
               with the name.  At the time of installation, all handles
               have their names initialized to ASCII nulls.  A handle with
               a name which is all ASCII nulls has, by definition, no name. 
               When a handle is assigned a name, at least one character in
               the name must be a non-null character in order to distin-
               guish it from a handle without a name.

          Function 22. Alter Page Map & Jump



          PURPOSE

               This function alters the memory mapping context and trans-
               fers control to the specified address.  It is analogous to
               the FAR JUMP in the 8086 family architecture.  The memory
               mapping context which existed before the invocation of this
               function is lost.

               Mapping no pages and jumping is not considered an error.  If
               a request to map zero pages and jump is made, control is
               transferred to the target address, and this function
               performs a far jump.

          Function 22. Alter Page Map & Jump



               DS:SI = pointer to map_and_jump structure
                   Contains a pointer to a structure that contains the
                   information necessary to map the desired physical pages
                   and jump to the target address.  The structure consists
                   of the following elements:

                   .target_address
                       The first member is a far pointer which contains the
                       target address to which control is to be trans-
                       ferred.  The address is represented in segment:of-
                       fset format.  The offset portion of the address is
                       stored in the low portion of the double word.

                   .log_phys_map_len
                       The second member is a byte which contains the
                       number of entries in the array of structures which
                       immediately follows it.  The array is as long as the
                       application developer needs in order to map the
                       desired logical pages into physical pages.  The
                       number of entries cannot exceed the number of
                       mappable pages in the system.

                   .log_phys_map_ptr
                       The third member is a pointer to an array of struc-
                       tures which contain the logical page numbers and
                       physical pages or segment address at which they are
                       to be mapped.  Each entry in the array of structures
                       contains the following two elements:

                   .log_page_number
                       The first member of this structure is a word which
                       contains the number of the logical page to be
                       mapped.

                   .phys_page_number_seg
                       The second member of this structure is a word which
                       contains either the physical page number or the
                       segment address representation of the physical page
                       number at which the previous logical page number is
                       to be mapped.  The value passed in AL determines the
                       type of representation.

          Function 23. Alter Page Map & Call
          Alter Page Map & Call subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This subfunction saves the current memory mapping context,
               alters the specified memory mapping context, and transfers
               control to the specified address.  It is analogous to the
               FAR CALL in the 8086 family architecture.  Just as a return
               from a FAR CALL restores the original value in the code
               segment register, this subfunction restores the state of the
               specified mapping context after the return.

               There is no explicit expanded memory subfunction which
               emulates a return from a FAR CALL.  However, this facility
               is implicitly available through the standard return from a
               FAR CALL.  The following paragraphs describe how this works:

               After this function is invoked, unless an error is detected,
               the memory manager will transfer control to the address
               specified.  If an error occurs, the memory manager returns
               immediately with the error code in the AH register. 
               Otherwise, the memory manager pushes on the stack informa-
               tion which enables it to restore the mapping context after
               the return.

               When the called procedure wants to return to the calling
               procedure, it simply issues a standard FAR RETURN.  The
               memory manager traps this return, restores the specified
               mapping context, and returns to the calling procedure.  The
               memory manager also returns a status from a successful
               return just as it does for all functions.

               Developers using this subfunction must make allowances for
               the additional stack space this subfunction will use.

                       The second member is a byte which contains the
                       number of entries in the new mapping context to
                       which new_page_map_ptr points.  This number cannot
                       exceed the number of mappable pages in the system.

                   .new_page_map_ptr
                       The third member is a far pointer that points to an
                       array of structures which contains a list of the
                       logical page numbers and the physical page num-
                       bers/segments at which they are to be mapped im-
                       mediately after the call.  The contents of the new
                       array of structures are described at the end of the
                       map_and_call structure.

                   .old_page_map_len
                       The fourth member is a byte which contains the
                       number of entries in the old mapping context to
                       which old_page_map_ptr points.  This number cannot
                       exceed the number of mappable pages in the system.

                   .old_page_map_ptr
                       The fifth member is a far pointer that points to an
                       array of structures which contains a list of the
                       logical page numbers and the physical page num-
                       bers/segments at which they are to be mapped im-
                       mediately after the return.  The contents of the old
                       array of structures are described at the end of the
                       map_and_call structure.

                   .reserved
                       The sixth member is reserved for use by the memory
                       manager.

               Each entry in the old and new array of structures contains
               two elements:

                   .log_page_number
                       The first member of this structure is a word which
                       contains a logical page number which is to be mapped
                       at the succeeding physical page number/segment
                       immediately after the CALL (in the case of the new
                       array of structures) or after the RETURN (in the
                       case of the old array of structures).

                   .phys_page_number_seg
                       The second member of this structure is a word which
                       contains either the physical page number or the
                       segment address representation of the physical page
                       number/segment at which the preceding logical page
                       is to be mapped immediately after the CALL (in the
                       case of the new array of structures) or after the
                       RETURN (in the case of the old array of structures).

          Function 24. Move/Exchange Memory Region
          Move Memory Region subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This subfunction copies a region of memory in the following
               memory source/destination combinations.

               o   conventional memory to conventional memory

               o   conventional memory to expanded memory

               o   expanded memory to conventional memory

               o   expanded memory to expanded memory

               You do not have to save and restore the expanded memory
               mapping context to perform these move operations.  The
               current mapping context is maintained throughout this
               operation.

               The length of the region is limited by the amount of
               expanded memory allocated to the handles specified. 
               However, in most practical applications, the region length
               will be considerably smaller.  A region length of zero is
               not an error, and no move will be performed.

               A region length which exceeds 16K bytes is not an error.  In
               this case the function assumes that a group of logical pages
               is the target for the move.  The logical page specified
               represents the first logical page in which the move will
               take place.  If the region length exceeds 16K bytes, or if
               the region is less than 16K bytes but spans logical pages,
               there must be sufficient logical pages remaining after the
               first logical page for the entire region to fit.

               If your application needs to save a region of conventional
               memory in expanded memory, you can move it without having to
               perform a save or restore of the current mapping context. 
               The memory manager maintains the context.  A move of up to
               1M bytes may be performed, although practical lengths are
               substantially less than this value.

               If the source and destination handles are identical, the
               source and destination regions are tested for overlap before
               the move.  If they overlap, the move direction is chosen so
               that the destination region receives an intact copy of the
               source region.  A status will be returned indicating that
               this overlap has occurred.

                   move_source_dest_struct         ENDS

               DS:SI = pointer to move_source_dest structure
                   Contains a pointer to a data structure which contains
                   the source and destination information for the move. 
                   The structure members are described here:

                   .region_length
                       The first member is a double word which specifies
                       the length of the memory region (in bytes) to be
                       moved.

                   .source_memory_type
                       The second member is a byte which specifies the type
                       of memory where the source region resides.  A value
                       of zero indicates that the source region resides in
                       conventional memory (excluding the page frame seg-
                       ment).  A value of one indicates that the source
                       region resides in expanded memory.

                   .source_handle
                       If the source region resides in expanded memory, the
                       third member is a word which specifies the handle
                       number associated with the source memory region.  If
                       the source region resides in conventional memory,
                       this variable has no meaning and should be set to
                       zero for future compatibility.

                   .source_initial_offset
                       The fourth member is a word which specifies the
                       offset within the source region from which to begin
                       the move.

          EMM Functions                                                 121






          Function 24. Move/Exchange Memory Region
          Move Memory Region subfunction



                       If the source region resides in expanded memory, the
                       source_initial_offset is relative to the beginning
                       of the 16K logical page.  Because the offset is
                       relative to the beginning of a 16K expanded memory
                       page, it may only take on values between 0000h and
                       3FFFh.

                       If the source region resides in conventional memory,
                       the source_initial_offset is a word which specifies
                       the offset, relative to the beginning of the source
                       segment, from which to begin the move.  Because the
                       offset is relative to the beginning of a 64K-byte
                       conventional memory segment, it may take on values
                       between 0000h and FFFFh.

                   .source_initial_seg_page
                       The fifth member is a word which specifies the
                       initial segment or logical page number within the
                       source region from which to begin the move.

                       If the source region resides in expanded memory, the
                       value specifies the logical page within the source
                       region from which to begin the move.

                       If the source region resides in conventional memory,
                       the source_initial_seg_page specifies the initial
                       segment address within conventional memory from
                       which to begin the move.

                   .dest_memory_type
                       The sixth member is a byte which specifies the type
                       of memory where the destination region resides.  A
                       value of zero indicates conventional memory; a value
                       of one indicates expanded memory.

                   .dest_handle
                       If the destination region resides in expanded
                       memory, the seventh member is a word which specifies
                       the handle number associated with the destination
                       memory region.  If the destination region resides in
                       conventional memory, this variable has no meaning
                       and should be set to zero for future compatibility.

                   .dest_initial_offset
                       The eighth member is a word which specifies the
                       offset within the destination region from which to
                       begin the move.

          Function 24. Move/Exchange Memory Region
          Move Memory Region subfunction



                       If the destination region resides in expanded
                       memory, the dest_initial_offset is relative to the
                       beginning of the 16K-byte logical page.  Because the
                       offset is relative to the beginning of a 16K-byte
                       expanded memory page, it may only take on values
                       between 0000h and 3FFFh.

                       If the destination region resides in conventional
                       memory, the dest_initial_offset is a word which
                       specifies the offset, relative to the beginning of
                       the destination segment, to begin the move.  Because
                       the offset is relative to the beginning of a 64K
                       conventional memory segment, it may take on values
                       between 0000h and FFFFh.

                   .dest_initial_seg_page
                       The ninth member is a word which specifies the
                       initial segment or logical page number within the
                       destination region from which to begin the move.

                       If the destination region resides in expanded memory
                       then the value specifies the logical page within the
                       destination region from which to begin the move.

                       If the destination region resides in conventional
                       memory, the dest_initial_seg_page specifies the
                       initial segment address within conventional memory
                       from which to begin the move.

                   The move has been completed and the destination region
                   has a full copy of the source region.  However, at least
                   a portion of the source region has been overwritten by
                   the move.  Note that the source and destination expanded
                   memory regions with different handles will never physi-

                   handle.  Insufficient pages are allocated to this handle
                   to move a region of the size specified.  The program can

          Function 24. Move/Exchange Memory Region
          Exchange Memory Region subfunction



          PURPOSE

               This subfunction exchanges (using a string move) a region of
               memory in any of the following memory source/destination
               combinations.

               o   conventional memory to conventional memory

               o   conventional memory to expanded memory

               o   expanded memory to conventional memory

               o   expanded memory to expanded memory

               The term expanded memory region refers only to the area of
               memory above 640K bytes (9FFFFh).  If a system provides
               mappable conventional memory, this function treats the
               mappable conventional memory regions as ordinary convention-
               al memory.  The contents of the source region and the
               destination region are exchanged.

               The exchange operation can be performed without having to
               save and restore the expanded memory mapping context.  The
               current mapping context is maintained throughout this
               operation.  The length of the region is limited to the
               amount of expanded memory allocated to the specified EMM
               handles.  A length of zero is not an error; however, no
               exchange will be performed.  A region length which exceeds
               16K bytes is not an error.  In this case the function
               assumes that a group of logical pages is the target for the
               exchange.  The logical page specified represents the first
               logical page in which the exchange will take place.  If the
               region length exceeds 16K bytes, or if the region is less
               than 16K bytes but spans logical pages, there must be
               sufficient logical pages remaining after the first logical
               page for the entire region to fit.

               If your application needs to exchange a region of conven-
               tional memory with expanded memory, you can simply exchange
               it with the region of interest without having to perform a
               save or restore of the current mapping context.  An exchange
               of up to 1M bytes may be performed, although practical
               lengths are obviously below that value.  Checking is done
               before starting the exchange to prevent the possibility of
               overlap during the exchange operation.  Overlapping source
               and destination regions for an exchange are invalid, and the
               exchange will not take place.

                   Contains a pointer to the data structure which contains
                   the source and destination information for the exchange. 
                   The structure members are described here:

                   .region_length
                       The first member is a double word which specifies
                       the length of the memory region to be exchanged.

                   .source_memory_type
                       The second member is a byte which specifies the type
                       of memory where the source region resides.  A value
                       of zero indicates that the source region resides in
                       conventional memory.  A value of one indicates that
                       the source region resides in expanded memory.

                   .source_handle
                       If the source region resides in expanded memory, the
                       third member is a word which specifies the handle
                       number associated with the source memory region.  If
                       the source region resides in conventional memory,
                       this variable has no meaning and should be set to
                       zero for future compatibility.

                   .source_initial_offset
                       The fourth member is a word which specifies the
                       offset within the source region from which to begin
                       the exchange.



          EMM Functions                                                 127






          Function 24. Move/Exchange Memory Region
          Exchange Memory Region subfunction



                       If the source region resides in expanded memory, the
                       source_initial_offset is relative to the beginning
                       of the 16K logical page.  Because the offset is
                       relative to the beginning of a 16K expanded memory
                       page, it may only take on values between 0000h and
                       3FFFh.

                       If the source region resides in conventional memory,
                       the source_initial_offset is a word which specifies
                       the offset, relative to the beginning of the source
                       segment, from which to begin the exchange at. 
                       Because the offset is relative to the beginning of a
                       64K-byte conventional memory segment, it may take on
                       values between 0000h and FFFFh.

                   .source_initial_seg_page
                       The fifth member is a word which specifies the
                       initial segment or logical page number within the
                       source region from which to begin the exchange.

                       If the source region resides in expanded memory then
                       the value specifies the logical page within the
                       source region from which to begin the exchange.

                       If the source region resides in conventional memory,
                       the source_initial_seg_page specifies the initial
                       segment address within conventional memory from
                       which to begin the exchange.

                   .dest_memory_type
                       The sixth member is a byte which specifies the type
                       of memory where the destination region resides.  A
                       value of zero indicates that the destination region
                       resides in conventional memory (excluding the page
                       frame segment).  A value of one indicates that the
                       destination region resides in expanded memory.

                   .dest_handle
                       If the destination region resides in expanded
                       memory, the seventh member is a word which specifies
                       the handle number associated with the destination
                       memory region.  If the destination region resides in
                       conventional memory, this variable has no meaning
                       and should be set to zero for future compatibility.

          Exchange Memory Region subfunction



                   .dest_initial_offset
                       The eighth member is a word which specifies the
                       offset within the destination region from which to
                       begin the exchange.

                       If the destination region resides in expanded
                       memory, the dest_initial_offset is relative to the
                       beginning of the 16K-byte logical page.  Because the
                       offset is relative to the beginning of a 16K-byte
                       expanded memory page, it may only take on values
                       between 0000h and 3FFFh.

                       If the destination region resides in conventional
                       memory, the dest_initial_offset is a word which
                       specifies the offset, relative to the beginning of
                       the destination segment, to begin the exchange at. 
                       Because the offset is relative to the beginning of a
                       64K conventional memory segment, it may take on
                       values between 0000h and FFFFh.

                   .dest_initial_seg_page
                       The ninth member is a word which specifies the
                       initial segment or logical page number within the
                       destination region from which to begin the exchange.

                       If the destination region resides in expanded memory
                       then the value specifies the logical page within the
                       destination region from which to begin the exchange.

                       If the destination region resides in conventional
                       memory, the dest_initial_seg_page specifies the
                       initial segment address within conventional memory
                       from which to begin the exchange.

               address and physical page number for each mappable physical
               page in a system.  The contents of this array provide a

               segment addresses for each mappable page in the system.  The
               array is sorted in ascending segment order.  This does not
               mean that the physical page numbers associated with the
               segment addresses are also in ascending order.

                       The first member is a word which contains the
                       segment address of the mappable physical page
                       associated with the physical page number following
                       it.  The array entries are sorted in ascending
                       segment address order.

                       previous segment address.  The physical page numbers
                       are not necessarily in ascending order.

                       corresponds to segment address C000h, physical page
                       1 corresponds to segment address C400h, etc.  The
                       array would contain the following data (in this

                       to segment address C400h, etc.  The array would
                       contain the following data in the order specified.

          PURPOSE

               This subfunction returns an array containing expanded memory
               hardware configuration information for use by an operating
               system/environment.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5900h
                   Contains the Get Hardware Configuration Array subfunc-
                   tion.

               ES:DI = hardware_info
                   Contains a pointer to a memory area that the operating
                   system supplies where the memory manager will copy
                   expanded memory hardware information.  The structure
                   contains these five members:

                   .raw_page_size
                       The first member is a word which contains the size
                       of a raw mappable physical page in paragraphs (16
                       bytes).  LIM standard pages are always 16K bytes. 
                       However, other implementations of expanded memory
                       boards do not necessarily comply with this standard
                       and can emulate a 16K-byte page by mapping in
                       multiple smaller pages.  This member specifies the
                       size of a mappable physical page viewed from the
                       hardware implementation level.




          EMM Functions                                                 138






          Function 26. Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information
          Get Hardware Configuration Array subfunction



                   .alternate_register_sets
                       The second member is a word which specifies the
                       number of alternate mapping register sets.  The
                       additional mapping register sets are termed alter-
                       nate mapping register sets in this document.

                       All expanded memory boards have at least one set of
                       hardware registers to perform the logical to
                       physical page mapping.  Some expanded memory boards
                       have more than one set of these mapping registers. 
                       This member specifies how many of these alternate
                       mapping register sets exist (beyond the one set that
                       all expanded memory boards have) on the expanded
                       memory boards in the system.  If an expanded memory
                       card has only one set of mapping registers (that is,
                       no alternate mapping register sets) this member has
                       a value of zero.

                   .context_save_area_size
                       The third member is a word which contains the
                       storage requirements for the array required to save
                       a mapping context.  The value returned in this
                       member is exactly the same as that returned by
                       Function 15 (Get Size of Page Map Save Array
                       subfunction).

                   .DMA_register_sets
                       The fourth member is a word which contains the
                       number of register sets that can be assigned to DMA
                       channels.  These DMA register sets, although similar
                       in use to alternate register sets, are for DMA
                       mapping and not task mapping.

                       If the expanded memory hardware does not support DMA
                       register sets, care must be taken when DMA is taking
                       place.

                       In a multitasking operating system, when one task is
                       waiting for DMA to complete, it is useful to be able
                       to switch to another task.  However, if the DMA is
                       taking place in memory that the second task will
                       need to remap, remapping would be disastrous.






          EMM Functions                                                 139






          Function 26. Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information
          Get Hardware Configuration Array subfunction



                       If the expanded memory hardware can detect when DMA
                       is occurring, the OS/E should allow task switches
                       and remapping during DMA.  If no special support for
                       DMA is available, no remapping should be done when
                       DMA is in progress.

                   .DMA_channel_operation
                       The fifth member is a word which specifies a special
                       case for the DMA register sets.  A value of zero
                       specifies that the DMA register sets behave as
                       described in Function 28.  A value of one specifies
                       that the expanded memory hardware has only one DMA
                       register set.  In addition, if any channel is mapped
                       through this register set, then all channels are
                       mapped through it.  For LIM standard boards, this
                       value is zero.

          Function 26. Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information
          Get Unallocated Raw Page Count subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Get Unallocated Raw Page Count subfunction returns the
               number of unallocated non-standard length mappable pages as
               well as the total number of non-standard length mappable
               pages in expanded memory to the operating system.

               One variety of expanded memory board has a page size which
               is a sub-multiple of 16K bytes.  An expanded memory page
               which is a sub-multiple of 16K is termed a raw page.  An
               operating system may deal with mappable physical page sizes
               which are sub-multiples of 16K bytes.

               If the expanded memory board supplies pages in exact
               multiples of 16K bytes, the number of pages this function
               returns is identical to the number Function 3 (Get Unallo-
               cated Page Count) returns.  In this case, there is no
               difference between a page and a raw page.

          Function 27. Allocate Standard/Raw Pages
          Allocate Standard Pages subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Allocate Standard Pages subfunction allocates the number
               of standard size (16K bytes) pages that the operating system
               requests and assigns a unique EMM handle to these pages. 
               The EMM handle owns these pages until the operating system
               deallocates them.  This subfunction allows you to allocate
               zero pages to a handle, unlike Function 4 (Allocate Pages).

          Note............................................................
               This note affects expanded memory manager implementors and
               operating system developers only.  Applications should not
               use the following characteristic of the memory manager.  An
               application violating this rule will be incompatible with
               future versions of Microsoft's operating systems and
               environments.

               To be compatible with this specification, an expanded memory
               manager will provide a special handle which is available to
               the operating system only.  This handle will have a value of
               0000h and will have a set of pages allocated to it when the
               expanded memory manager driver installs.  The pages that the
               memory manager will automatically allocate to handle 0000h
               are those that backfill conventional memory.  Typically,
               this backfill occurs between addresses 40000h (256K) and
               9FFFFh (640K).  However, the range can extend below and
               above this limit if the hardware and memory manager have the
               capability.

               An operating system won't have to invoke Function 27 to
               obtain this handle because it can assume the handle already
               exists and is available for use immediately after the
               expanded memory device driver installs.  When an operating
               system wants to use this handle, it uses the special handle
               value of 0000h.  The operating system will be able to invoke
               any EMM function using this special handle value.  To
               allocate pages to this handle, the operating system need
               only invoke Function 18 (Reallocate Pages).

               There are two special cases for this handle:

               1.  Function 27 (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction).  This
                   function must never return zero as a handle value. 
                   Applications must always invoke Function 27 to allocate
                   pages and obtain a handle which identifies the pages
                   which belong to it.  Since Function 27 never returns a


          EMM Functions                                                 144






          Function 27. Allocate Standard/Raw Pages
          Allocate Standard Pages subfunction



                   handle value of zero, an application will never gain
                   access to this special handle.

               2.  Function 6 (Deallocate Pages).  If the operating system
                   uses it to deallocate the pages which are allocated to
                   this handle, the pages the handle owns will be returned
                   to the manager for use.  But the handle will not be
                   available for reassignment.  The manager should treat a
                   deallocate pages function request for this handle the
                   same as a reallocate pages function request, where the
                   number of pages to reallocate to this handle is zero.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5A00h
                   Contains the Allocate Standard Pages subfunction.

               BX = num_of_standard_pages_to_alloc
                   Contains the number of standard pages the operating
                   system wants to allocate.


          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               DX = handle
                   Contains a unique EMM handle.  The operating system must
                   use this EMM handle as a parameter in any function that
                   requires it.  Up to 255 handles may be obtained.  (Both
                   Function 27 and Function 4 must share the same 255
                   handles.)

                   For all functions using this handle, the length of the
                   physical and logical pages allocated to it are standard
                   length (that is, 16K bytes).

          Function 27. Allocate Standard/Raw Pages
          Allocate Raw Pages subfunction



          PURPOSE

               The Allocate Raw Pages function allocates the number of non-
               standard size pages that the operating system requests and
               assigns a unique EMM handle to these pages.  The EMM handle
               owns these pages until the operating system deallocates
               them.  This function allows you to allocate zero pages to a
               handle, unlike Function 4 (Allocate Pages).

               A hardware vendor may design an expanded memory board that
               has a page size which is a sub-multiple of 16K bytes.  A
               physical page which is a sub-multiple of 16K is termed a raw
               page.  The operating system may deal with page sizes which
               are sub-multiples of 16K bytes.  The memory manager must
               treat any function using a handle with raw pages allocated
               to it by Function 27 (Allocate Raw Pages subfunction)
               differently than it does a handle that has normal 16K-byte
               pages allocated to it.

               Handles which are assigned using Function 4 (Allocate Pages)
               or Function 27 (Allocate Standard Pages subfunction) must
               have pages which are 16K bytes -- this is the length of a
               standard expanded memory page.  If the expanded memory board
               hardware is not able to supply 16K-byte pages, the memory
               manager must emulate pages which are 16K bytes combining
               multiple non-standard size pages to form a single 16K-byte
               page.

               Handles which are assigned using Function 27 (Allocate Raw
               Pages subfunction) are called raw handles.  All logical
               pages allocated to a raw handle may have a non-standard
               length (that is, not 16K bytes).  However, once the operat-
               ing system has allocated a number of raw pages to a handle,
               it is the responsibility of the memory manager to recognize
               that raw handle as one that has non-standard size pages
               allocated to it.  The memory manager must identify these
               handles and treat all functions which use handles which have
               non-standard page lengths differently.  The logical page
               length becomes the length of the non-standard size page for
               any raw handle that Function 27 assigns.

          Note............................................................
               This note affects expanded memory manager implementors and
               operating system developers only.  Applications should not
               use the following characteristic of the memory manager.  An
               application violating this rule will be incompatible with


          EMM Functions                                                 147






          Function 27. Allocate Standard/Raw Pages
          Allocate Raw Pages subfunction



               future versions of Microsoft's operating systems and
               environments.

               To be compatible with this specification, an expanded memory
               manager will provide a special handle which is available to
               the operating system only.  This handle will have a value of
               0000h and will have a set of pages allocated to it when the
               expanded memory manager driver installs.  The pages that the
               memory manager will automatically allocate to handle 0000h
               are those that backfill conventional memory.  Typically,
               this backfill occurs between addresses 40000h (256K) and
               9FFFFh (640K).  However, the range can extend below and
               above this limit if the hardware and memory manager have the
               capability.

               An operating system won't have to invoke Function 27 to
               obtain this handle because it can assume the handle already
               exists and is available for use immediately after the
               expanded memory device driver installs.  When an operating
               system wants to use this handle, it uses the special handle
               value of 0000h.  The operating system will be able to invoke
               any EMM function using this special handle value.  To
               allocate pages to this handle, the operating system need
               only invoke Function 18 (Reallocate Pages).

               There are two special cases for this handle:

               1.  Function 27 (Allocate Raw Pages subfunction).  This
                   function must never return zero as a handle value. 
                   Applications must always invoke Function 27 to allocate
                   pages and obtain a handle which identifies the pages
                   which belong to it.  Since Function 27 never returns a
                   handle value of zero, an application will never gain
                   access to this special handle.

               2.  Function 6 (Deallocate Pages).  If the operating system
                   uses it to deallocate the pages which are allocated to
                   this handle, the pages the handle owns will be returned
                   to the manager for use.  But the handle will not be
                   available for reassignment.  The manager should treat a
                   deallocate pages function request for this handle the
                   same as a reallocate pages function request, where the
                   number of pages to reallocate to this handle is zero.

          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

                   Contains a unique EMM raw handle.  The operating system
                   must use this EMM raw handle as a parameter in any
                   function that requires it.  Up to 255 handles may be
                   obtained.  (Both Function 4 and Function 27 must share
                   the same 255 handles).

                   For all functions using this raw handle, the length of
                   the physical and logical pages allocated to it may be
                   non-standard (that is, not 16K bytes).

          Design Considerations

               The hardware support for the entire set of subfunctions
               described is generally not present on every expanded memory
               board from every vendor of expanded memory board products. 
               For some of the subfunctions, software emulation is provid-
               ed.  For other subfunctions, a certain protocol in their use
               must be observed.  The subfunctions for which this is most
               crucial are those which address system DMA capabilities.


          System DMA Capabilities & Expanded Memory Support of DMA

               In a multitasking operating system, when one task is waiting
               for DMA to complete, it is useful to be able to switch to
               another task.  This specification describes a capability
               which may be designed into expanded memory boards to provide
               DMA into memory regions which may be mapped out while the
               DMA is occurring.  For expanded memory boards that do not
               provide this, it is crucial to understand that while DMA is
               in progress into a region of mappable memory, the memory
               mapping context cannot be changed.  That is, all DMA action
               must be complete before any remapping of pages can be done.


          Expanded Memory Support of DMA Register Sets

               Expanded memory boards which have DMA register sets could
               support DMA into a region of mappable memory while the
               memory mapping context is being switched.  It is important
               to realize that these DMA register sets are separate from
               the alternate map register sets.  An example of how an OS/E
               might use DMA register sets follows:

                                      Example 1

               1.  Allocate a DMA register set.

               2.  Get current register set.

               3.  Set the DMA register set.

          Function 28. Alternate Map Register Set



               4.  Map in the memory desired.

               5.  Get the DMA register set.

               6.  Set the original register set.

               7.  Assign the desired DMA channel to the DMA register set.

               The preceding set of calls makes all DMA accesses for the
               desired DMA channel get mapped through the current DMA
               register set regardless of the current register set.  In
               other words, the DMA register set overrides the current
               mapping register set for DMA operations on the DMA channel
               specified.  A DMA channel that is not assigned to a DMA
               register set has all its DMA operations mapped through the
               current mapping register set.

          Note............................................................
               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The
               operating system can disable this function at any time.

          PURPOSE

               The subfunction does one of two things depending on the map
               register set which is active at the time this function is
               invoked:

               1.  If the preceding Set Alternate Map Register Set call was
                   done with the alternate map register set equal to zero
                   (BL = 0), these points apply:

                   a.  The context save area pointer saved within EMM by
                       the Set Alternate Map Register subfunction is
                       returned by this call.  This pointer is always
                       returned for boards which do not supply alternate
                       mapping register sets.

                   b.  If the context save area pointer returned is not
                       equal to zero, this subfunction copies the contents
                       of the mapping registers on each expanded memory
                       board in the system into the save area specified by
                       the pointer.  The format of this save area is the
                       same as that returned by Function 15 (Get Page Map
                       subfunction).  This is intended to simulate getting
                       an alternate map register set.  Note that the memory
                       manager does not allocate the space for the context: 
                       the operating system must do so.

                   c.  If the context save area pointer returned is equal
                       to zero, this subfunction does not copy the contents
                       of the mapping registers on each expanded memory
                       board in the system into the save area specified by
                       the pointer.

                   d.  The context save area pointer must have been
                       initialized by a previous Set Alternate Map Register
                       Set call.  Note that the value of the context save
                       area pointer saved within EMM is zero immediately
                       after installation.

          Function 28. Alternate Map Register Set
          Get Alternate Map Register Set subfunction



                   e.  The context save area must be initialized by a
                       previous Get Page Map call (Function 15).

               2.  If the preceding Set Alternate Map Register Set call was
                   done with the alternate map register set greater than
                   zero (BL > 0), then the number of the alternate map
                   register set which is in use at the time that this
                   function is invoked is returned.  The context save area
                   pointer is not returned in this case.

                   ment:offset format.  This pointer is always returned if
                   the expanded memory hardware does not supply alternate

          Function 28. Alternate Map Register Set

                   The operating system first passes this pointer to the
                   memory manager whenever it invokes a Set Alternate Map
                   Register Set subfunction (the description follows).  If
                   the OS/E invokes this function before invoking a Set
                   Alternate Map Register Set subfunction, this function
                   returns a pointer value of zero.  The OS/E must have
                   allocated the space for the save area.  However, the OS
                   must request that the memory manager initialize the
                   contents of this save area before it contains any useful
                   information.

                   The OS/E must initialize the save area it has allocated
                   by invoking Function 15 (Get Page Map subfunction). 
                   After the OS/E has done this, the save area will contain
                   the state of all the map registers on all boards in the
                   system.  The save area will also contain any additional
                   information necessary to restore the boards to their
                   original state when the operating system invokes a Set
                   Alternate Map Register Set subfunction.

          Note............................................................
               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The
               operating system can disable this function at any time. 
               Refer to Function 30 for a description of how an operating
               system can enable or disable this function.


          PURPOSE

               The subfunction does one of two things, depending on the map
               register set specified:

               1.  If the alternate map register set specified is zero, map
                   register set zero is activated.  If the map register
                   context restore area pointer is not equal to zero, the
                   contents of the restore area pointed to by ES:DI are
                   copied into register set zero on each expanded memory
                   board in the system.  If the pointer is equal to zero,
                   the contents are not copied.

                   Regardless of its value, the map register context
                   restore area pointer is saved within the memory manager. 
                   It will be used during the Get Alternate Map Register
                   Set subfunction.

                   The operating system must supply the pointer to the
                   area.  This subfunction is intended to simulate setting
                   an alternate map register set.  Note that the operating
                   system must allocate the space for the context.  The
                   memory manager saves the context save area pointer
                   internally.

               2.  If the alternate map register set specified is not zero,
                   the alternate map register set specified is activated. 
                   The restore area, which the operating system is pointing
                   to, is not used.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5B01h

          Function 28. Alternate Map Register Set
          Set Alternate Map Register Set subfunction



               BL = new alternate map register set number
                   Contains the number of the alternate map register set
                   which is to be activated.

                   If BL <> 0
                       A pointer to a map register context restore area is
                       not required and the contents of ES:DI is unaffected
                       and ignored.  The alternate map register set
                       specified in BL is activated if the board supports
                       it.

                   If BL = 0
                       A pointer to an area which contains the state of all
                       the map registers on all boards in the system, and
                       any additional information necessary to restore the
                       boards to their original state, has been passed in
                       ES:DI.

               ES:DI = pointer to a map register context restore area
                   Contains a pointer to an OS/E supplied map register
                   context restore area.  The pointer is in standard
                   segment:offset format.  This pointer must always be
                   passed if the expanded memory hardware does not supply
                   alternate mapping register sets.

                   The memory manager must save this pointer whenever the
                   OS/E invokes this function.  The OS/E must have allo-
                   cated the space for the restore area.  Additionally, the
                   contents of this restore area must have been initialized
                   by the memory manager before it will contain any useful
                   information.  The OS/E initializes the restore area it
                   has allocated by invoking Function 15 (Get Page Map
                   subfunction).  After the OS/E has done this, the restore
                   area will contain the state of the map registers on all
                   boards in the system, and any additional information
                   necessary to restore the boards to their original state
                   when the operating system invokes a Set Alternate Map
                   Register Set subfunction.

               Refer to Function 30 for a description of how an operating
               system can enable or disable this function.


          PURPOSE

               The Allocate Alternate Map Register Set subfunction gets the
               number of an alternate map register set for an operating
               system if an alternate map register set is currently
               available for use.  If the hardware does not support
               alternate map register sets, an alternate map register set
               number of zero will be returned.

               The alternate map register set allocated may be referred to
               by this number when using the Get or Set Alternate Map
               Register Set subfunctions.  The operating system can use
               these subfunctions to switch map contexts very rapidly on
               expanded memory boards with alternate map register sets.

               This subfunction copies the currently active alternate map
               register set's contents into the newly allocated alternate
               map register set's mapping registers.  This is done so that
               when the OS/E performs a Set Alternate Map Register Set
               subfunction the memory mapped before the allocation of the
               new alternate map will be available for reading and writing. 
               This function does not actually change the alternate map
               register set in use, but in addition to allocating a new
               alternate map register set, it prepares the new alternate
               map register set for a subsequent Set Alternate Map Register
               Set subfunction.

          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               BL = alternate map register set number
                   Contains the number of an alternate map register set. 
                   If there are no alternate map register sets supported by
                   the hardware, a zero will be returned.  In this case,
                   the Get Alternate Map function (Function 28) should be
                   invoked in order to obtain a pointer to a map register
                   context save area.  The OS/E must supply this area.  The
                   save area is necessary because the hardware doesn't
                   support alternate map register sets.

               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The
               operating system can disable this function at any time. 
               Refer to Function 30 for a description of how an operating

          PURPOSE

               The Deallocate Alternate Map Register Set subfunction
               returns the alternate map register set to the memory manager
               for future use.  The memory manager may reallocate the
               alternate map register set when needed.

               This subfunction also makes the mapping context of the
               alternate map register specified unavailable for reading or
               writing (unmapping).  This protects the pages previously
               mapped in an alternate map register set by making them
               inaccessible.  Note that the current alternate map register
               set cannot be deallocated.  This makes all memory which was
               currently mapped into conventional and expanded memory
               inaccessible.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5B04h
                   Contains the Deallocate Alternate Map Register Set

                   or deallocated.  However, if alternate map register set
                   zero is specified and this subfunction is invoked, no
                   error will be returned.  The function invocation is
                   ignored in this case.

          Allocate DMA Register Set subfunction



          Note............................................................
               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The
               operating system can disable this function at any time. 
               Refer to Function 30 for a description of how an operating
               system can enable or disable this function.


          PURPOSE

               The Allocate DMA Register Set subfunction gets the number of
               a DMA register set for an OS/E, if a DMA register set is
               currently available for use.  If the hardware does not
               support DMA register sets, a DMA register set number of zero
               will be returned.

               In a multitasking operating system, when one task is waiting
               for DMA to complete, it is useful to be able to switch to
               another task.  However, if the DMA is being mapped through
               the current register set, the switching cannot occur.  That
               is, all DMA action must be complete before any remapping of
               pages can be done.

               The operating system would initiate a DMA operation on a
               specific DMA channel using a specific alternate map register
               set.  This alternate map register set would not be used
               again, by the operating system or an application, until
               after the DMA operation is complete.  The operating system
               guarantees this by not changing the contents of the alter-
               nate map register set, or allowing an application to change
               the contents of the alternate map register set, for the
               duration of the DMA operation.

               AX = 5B05h
                   Contains the Allocate DMA Register Set subfunction.


          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

                   Contains the number of a DMA register set.  If there are

                   will be returned.

          Note............................................................
               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The

               Refer to Function 30 for a description of how an operating
               system can enable or disable this function.


          PURPOSE

               This subfunction allows DMA accesses on a specific DMA
               channel to be associated with a specific alternate map
               register set.  In a multitasking operating system, when a
               task is waiting for the completion of DMA, it is useful to
               be able to switch to another task until the DMA operation
               completes.

               Any DMA on the specified channel will go through the speci-
               fied DMA register set regardless of the current register
               set.  If a DMA channel is not assigned to a DMA register
               set, DMA for that channel will be mapped through the current
               register set.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5B06h
                   Contains the Enable DMA on Alternate Map Register Set

                   be used for DMA operations on the DMA channel specified
                   by DL.  If the alternate map register set specified is
                   zero, no special action will be taken on DMA accesses
                   for the DMA channel specified.

               DL = DMA channel number
                   Contains the DMA channel which is to be associated with
                   the DMA map register set specified in BL.

          Function 29. Prepare Expanded Memory Hardware For Warm Boot



          PURPOSE

               This function prepares the expanded memory hardware for an
               impending warm boot.  This function assumes that the next
               operation that the operating system performs is a warm boot
               of the system.  In general, this function will effect the
               current mapping context, the alternate register set in use,
               and any other expanded memory hardware dependencies which
               need to be initialized at boot time.  If an application
               decides to map memory below 640K, the application must trap
               all possible conditions leading to a warm boot and invoke
               this function before performing the warm boot itself.

          Function 30. Enable/Disable OS/E Function Set Functions
          Enable OS/E Function Set subfunction



          Note............................................................
               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The
               operating system can disable this function at any time.


          PURPOSE

               This subfunction provides an OS/E with the ability to enable
               all programs or device drivers to use the OS/E specific
               functions.  The capability is provided only for an OS/E
               which manages regions of mappable conventional memory and
               cannot permit programs to use any of the functions which
               affect mappable conventional memory regions, but must be
               able to use these functions itself.  When an OS/E disables
               these functions and a program attempts to use them, the
               memory manager returns a status to the program indicating
               that the OS/E has denied the program access to the function. 
               In other words, the functions will not work when disabled. 
               However, all programs may use them when enabled.

               The OS/E (Operating System/Environment) functions this
               subfunction enables are:

               Function 26.  Get Expanded Memory Hardware Information.
               Function 28.  Alternate Map Register Sets.
               Function 30.  Enable/Disable Operating System Functions.

               It appears contradictory that the OS/E can re-enable these
               functions when the function which re-enables them is itself
               disabled.  An overview of the process follows.

               The memory manager enables all the OS/E specific functions,
               including this one, when it is loaded.  The OS/E gets
               exclusive access to these functions by invoking either of
               the Enable/Disable OS/E Function Set subfunctions before any
               other software does.

               On the first invocation of either of these subfunctions, the
               memory manager returns an access_key which the OS/E must use
               in all future invocations of either of these subfunctions. 
               The memory manager does not require the access_key on the
               first invocation of the Enable/Disable OS/E Function Set
               subfunctions.





          EMM Functions                                                 179






          Function 30. Enable/Disable OS/E Function Set Functions
          Enable OS/E Function Set subfunction



               On all subsequent invocations, the access_key is required
               for either the Enable or Disable OS/E Function Set subfunc-
               tions.  Since the access_key is returned only on the first
               invocation of the Enable/Disable OS/E Function Set subfunc-
               tions, and presumably the OS/E is the first software to
               invoke this function, only the OS/E obtains a copy of this
               key.  The memory manager must return an access key with a
               random value, a fixed value key defeats the purpose of
               providing this level of security for an OS/E.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5D00h
                   Contains the Enable OS/E Function Set subfunction.

                   The access_key value returned by the first function
                   invocation is required.


          RESULTS

               These results are valid only if the status returned is zero.

               BX,CX = access_key
                   Returned only on the first function invocation, the
                   memory manager returns a random valued key which will be
                   required thereafter for the execution of this function. 
                   On all invocations after the first, this key is not
                   returned.  Neither BX nor CX is affected after the first

          Function 30. Enable/Disable OS/E Function Set Functions
          Return Access Key subfunction



          Note............................................................
               This function is for use by operating systems only.  The
               operating system can disable this function at any time.


          PURPOSE

               This subfunction provides an OS/E with the ability to return
               the access key to the memory manager.  Returning the access
               key to the memory manager places the memory manager in the
               state it is in at installation time (regarding the use of
               the OS/E function set and the access key).  That is, access
               to the OS/E function set is enabled.  Upon execution of the
               next enable/disable OS/E function set subfunction, the
               access key will once again be returned.


          CALLING PARAMETERS

               AX = 5D02h
                   Contains the Return Access Key subfunction.

               BX,CX = access_key
                   Required on all function invocations.  The access_key
                   value returned by the first function invocation of the
                   enable or disable subfunctions is required.

                                      software.  A condition has been
                                      detected which would not have
                                      occurred if the memory manager had
                                      been operating correctly.

                                      hardware.  A condition has been
                                      detected which would not occur if the
                                      memory hardware were working correct-
                                      ly.  Diagnostics should be run on the
                                      expanded memory system to determine
                                      the source of the problem.

                                      version 3.2 of the memory manager or
                                      above.  In earlier versions of the
                                      memory manager this code meant a
                                      "busy" status.  This status indicated
                                      that the memory manager was already
                                      processing an expanded memory request
                                      when the current request was made and
                                      is unable to process another request. 
                                      In versions 3.2 of the memory manager
                                      and above, the memory manager is
                                      never "busy" and can always honor
                                      requests.

           83h   44h, 45h, 47h, 48h   The memory manager can not find the
                 4Ch, 5000h, 5001h    handle specified.  The program has
                 51h, 5200h, 5201h    probably corrupted its specified
                 5300h, 5301h         handle.  The memory manager does not
                 5500h, 5501h         have any information pertaining to
                 5600h, 5601h         the  specified handle.  The program
                 5700h, 5701h         has probably corrupted its handle.

                                      has been detected.  This error occurs
                                      when a program attempts to return a
                                      handle and there is still a "mapping

                                      indicated handle.  A program can
                                      recover from this error by restoring
                                      the mapping context before returning

                                      or by requesting fewer pages.

          Appendix B
          TESTING FOR THE PRESENCE OF THE EXPANDED MEMORY MANAGER



               Before an application program can use the Expanded Memory
               Manager, it must determine whether DOS has loaded the
               manager.  This appendix describes two methods your program
               can use to test for the presence of the memory manager and
               how to choose the correct one for your situation.

               The first method uses the DOS "open handle" technique; the
               second method uses the DOS "get interrupt vector" technique.


          Which method should your program use?

               The majority of application programs can use either the
               "open handle" or the "get interrupt vector" method. 
               However, if your program is a device driver or if it
               interrupts DOS during file system operations, you must use
               only the "get interrupt vector" method.

               Device drivers execute from within DOS and can't access the
               DOS file system; programs that interrupt DOS during file
               system operations have a similar restriction.  During their
               interrupt processing procedures, they can't access the DOS
               file system because another program may be using the system. 
               Since the "get interrupt vector" method doesn't require the
               DOS file system, you must use it for these types of pro-
               grams.


          The "open handle" technique

               Most application programs can use the DOS "open handle"
               technique to test for the presence of the memory manager. 
               This section describes how to use the technique and gives an
               example.

          Caution.........................................................
               Don't use this technique if your program is a device driver
               or if it interrupts DOS during file system operations.  Use
               the "get interrupt vector" technique described later in this
               appendix.


          Using the "open handle" technique

               This section describes how to use the DOS "open handle"
               technique to test for the presence of the memory manager. 
               Follow these steps in order:

          Testing For The Presence Of The EMM                           199






               1.  Issue an "open handle" command (DOS function 3Dh) in
                   "read only" access mode (register AL = 0).  This
                   function requires your program to point to an ASCII
                   string which contains the path name of the file or
                   device in which you're interested (register set DS:DX
                   contains the pointer).  In this case the file is
                   actually the name of the memory manager.

                   You should format the ASCII string as follows:

                   ASCII_device_name  DB  'EMMXXXX0', 0

                   The ASCII codes for the capital letters EMMXXXX0 are
                   terminated by a byte containing a value of zero.

               2.  If DOS returns no error status code, skip Steps 3 and 4
                   and go to Step 5.  If DOS returns a "Too many open
                   files" error status code, go to Step 3.  If DOS returns
                   a "File/Path not found" error status code, skip Step 3
                   and go to Step 4.

               3.  If DOS returns a "Too many open files" (not enough
                   handles) status code, your program should invoke the
                   "open file" command before it opens any other files. 
                   This will guarantee that at least one file handle will
                   be available to perform the function without causing
                   this error.

                   After the program performs the "open file" command, it
                   should perform the test described in Step 6 and close
                   the "file handle" (DOS function 3Eh).  Don't keep the
                   manager "open" after this status test is performed since
                   "manager" functions are not available through DOS.  Go
                   to Step 6.

               4.  If DOS returns a "File/Path not found," the memory
                   manager is not installed.  If your application requires
                   the memory manager, the user will have to reboot the
                   system with a disk containing the memory manager and the
                   appropriate CONFIG.SYS file before proceeding.

               5.  If DOS doesn't return an error status code you can
                   assume that either a device with the name EMMXXXX0 is
                   resident in the system, or a file with this name is on
                   disk in the current disk drive.  Go to Step 6.

               6.  Issue an "I/O Control for Devices" command (DOS function
                   44h) with a "get device information" command (register
                   AL = 0).  DOS function 44h determines whether EMMXXXX0
                   is a device or a file.



          Testing For The Presence Of The EMM                           200






                   You must use the file handle (register BX) which you
                   obtained in Step 1 to access the "EMM" device.

                   This function returns the "device information" in a word
                   (register DX).  Go to Step 7.

               7.  If DOS returns any error status code, you should assume
                   that the memory manager device driver is not installed. 
                   If your application requires the memory manager, the
                   user will have to reboot the system with a disk contain-
                   ing the memory manager and the appropriate CONFIG.SYS
                   file before proceeding.

               8.  If DOS didn't return an error status, test the contents
                   of bit 7 (counting from 0) of the "device information"
                   word (register DX) the function returned.  Go to Step 9.

               9.  If bit 7 of the "device information" word contains a
                   zero, then EMMXXXX0 is a file, and the memory manager
                   device driver is not present.  If your application
                   requires the memory manager, the user will have to
                   reboot the system with a disk containing the memory
                   manager and the appropriate CONFIG.SYS file before
                   proceeding.

                   If bit 7 contains a one, then EMMXXXX0 is a device.  Go
                   to Step 10.

               10. Issue an "I/O Control for Devices" command (DOS function
                   44h) with a "get output status" command (register AL =
                   7).

                   You must use the file handle you obtained in Step 1 to
                   access the "EMM" device (register BX).  Go to Step 11.

               11. If the expanded memory device driver is "ready," the
                   memory manager passes a status value of "FFh" in
                   register AL.  The status value is "00h" if the device
                   driver is "not ready."

                   If the memory manager device driver is "not ready" and
                   your application requires its presence, the user will
                   have to reboot the system with a disk containing the
                   memory manager and the appropriate CONFIG.SYS file
                   before proceeding.

                   If the memory manager device driver is "ready," go to
                   Step 12.





          Testing For The Presence Of The EMM                           201






               12. Issue a "Close File Handle" command (DOS function 3Eh)
                   to close the expanded memory device driver.  You must
                   use the file handle you obtained in Step 1 to close the
                   "EMM" device (register BX).

          The "get interrupt vector" technique

               Any type of program can use the DOS "get interrupt vector"
               technique to test for the presence of the memory manager. 
               This section describes how to use the technique and gives an
               example.

          Caution.........................................................
               Be sure to use this technique (and not the "open handle"
               technique) if your program is a device driver or if it
               interrupts DOS during file system operations.


          Using the "get interrupt vector" technique

               This section describes how to use the DOS "get interrupt
               vector" technique to test for the presence of the memory
               manager.  Follow these steps in order:

               1.  Issue a "get vector" command (DOS function 35h) to
                   obtain the contents of interrupt vector array entry
                   number 67h (addresses 0000:019Ch thru 0000:019Fh).

                   The memory manager uses this interrupt vector to perform
                   all manager functions.  The offset portion of this
                   interrupt service routine address is stored in the word
                   located at address 0000:019Ch; the segment portion is
                   stored in the word located at address 0000:019Eh.

               2.  Compare the "device name field" with the contents of the
                   ASCII string which starts at the address specified by
                   the segment portion of the contents of interrupt vector
                   address 67h and a fixed offset of 000Ah.  If DOS loaded
                   the memory manager at boot time this name field will
                   have the name of the device in it.

                   Since the memory manager is implemented as a character
                   device driver, its program origin is 0000h.  Device
                   drivers are required to have a "device header" located
                   at the program origin.  Within the "device header" is an
                   8 byte "device name field."  For a character mode device
                   driver this name field is always located at offset 000Ah
                   within the device header.  The device name field
                   contains the name of the device which DOS uses when it
                   references the device.

                   If the result of the "string compare" in this technique
                   is positive, the memory manager is present.

          Appendix C
          EXPANDED MEMORY MANAGER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES



               In addition to the functional specification, the expanded
               memory manager should provide certain resources.  The
               following guidelines are provided so required resources are
               present in expanded memory managers which comply with this
               version of the LIM specification.

               o   The amount of expanded memory supported:
                   Up to a maximum of 32M bytes of expanded memory should
                   be supported.

               o   The number of handles supported:
                   The maximum number of expanded memory handles provided
                   should be 255, the minimum should be 64.

               o   Handle Numbering:
                   Although a handle is a word quantity, there is a maximum
                   of 255 handles, including the operating system handle. 
                   This specification defines the handle word as follows: 
                   the low byte of the word is the actual handle value, the
                   high byte of the handle is set to 00h by the memory
                   manager.  Previous versions of this specification did
                   not specify the value of handles.

               o   New handle type:  Handles versus Raw Handles:
                   The difference between a raw handle and a regular handle
                   is slight.  If you use Function 27 to "Allocate raw
                   pages to a handle," what is returned in DX is termed a
                   raw handle.  The raw handle does not necessarily refer
                   to 16K-byte pages.  Instead it refers to the "raw" page
                   size, which depends on the expanded memory hardware.

                   An application program can use Function 26 to find the
                   raw page size, and by using the raw handle Function 27
                   returns, it can access them with the finer resolution
                   that a particular expanded memory board may allow.

                   On the other hand, applications which use Function 4 to
                   "allocate pages to handle" receive a handle which always
                   refers to 16K-byte pages.  On expanded memory boards
                   with smaller raw pages, the EMM driver will allocate and
                   maintain the number of raw pages it takes to create a
                   single composite 16K-byte page.  The difference between
                   the expanded memory boards' raw page size and the 16K-
                   byte LIM page size is transparent to the application
                   when it is using a handle obtained with Function 4.



          EMM Implementation Guidelines                                 206






                   The memory manager must differentiate between pages
                   allocated to handles and pages allocated to raw handles. 
                   The meaning of a call to the driver changes depending on
                   whether a handle or a raw handle is passed to the memory
                   manager.  If, for example, a handle is passed to
                   Function 18 (Reallocate), the memory manager will
                   increase or decrease the number of 16K-byte pages
                   allocated to the handle.  If Function 18 is passed a raw
                   handle, the memory manager will increase or decrease the
                   number of raw (non-16K-byte) pages allocated to the raw
                   handle.  For LIM standard boards, there is no difference
                   between pages and raw pages.

               o   The system Raw Handle (Raw Handle = 0000h):
                   For expanded memory boards that can remap the memory in
                   the lower 640K-byte address space, managing the pages of
                   memory which are used to fill in the lower 640K can be a
                   problem.  To solve this problem, the memory manager will
                   create a raw handle with a value of 0000h when DOS loads
                   the manager.  This raw handle is called the system
                   handle.

                   At power up, the memory manager will allocate all of the
                   pages that are mapped into the lower 640K bytes to the
                   system handle.  These pages should be mapped in their
                   logical order.  For example, if the system board
                   supplies 256K bytes of RAM, and the 384K bytes above it
                   is mappable, the system handle should have its logical
                   page zero mapped into the first physical page at 256K,
                   its logical page one mapped into the next physical page,
                   and so on.

                   The system handle should deal with raw pages.  To
                   release some of these pages so application programs can
                   use them, an operating system could decrease the number
                   of pages allocated to the system handle with the
                   "Reallocate" function.  Invoking the "Deallocate"
                   function would decrease the system handle to zero size,
                   but it must not deallocate the raw handle itself.  The
                   "Deallocate" function treats the system handle dif-
                   ferently than it treats other raw handles.  If the
                   operating system can ever be "exited" (for example, the
                   way Windows can be exited), it must increase the size of
                   the system handle back to what is needed to fill 640K
                   and map these logical pages back into physical memory
                   before returning to DOS.







          EMM Implementation Guidelines                                 207






                   There are two functional special cases for this handle:

                   -   The first special case deals with Function 4
                       (Allocate Pages).  This function must never return
                       zero as a handle value.  Applications must always
                       invoke Function 4 to allocate pages and obtain a
                       handle which identifies its pages.  Since Function 4
                       will never return a handle value of zero, an
                       application will never gain access to this special
                       handle.

                   -   The second special case deals with Function 6
                       (Deallocate Pages).  If the operating system uses
                       Function 6 to deallocate the pages which are
                       allocated to the system handle, the pages will be
                       returned to the manager for use, but the handle will
                       not be available for reassignment.  The manager
                       should treat a "deallocate pages" function request
                       for this handle the same as a "reallocate pages"
                       function request, where the number of pages to
                       reallocate to this handle is zero.

               o   Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) Program Cooperation:
                   In order for TSR's to cooperate with each other and with
                   other applications, TSR's must follow this rule:  a
                   program may only remap the DOS partition it lives in. 
                   This rule applies at all times, even when no expanded
                   memory is present.

               o   Accelerator Cards:
                   To support generic accelerator cards, the support of
                   Function 34, as defined by AST, is encouraged.





















          EMM Implementation Guidelines                                 208






          Appendix D
          OPERATING SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT USE OF FUNCTION 28



               All expanded memory boards have a set of registers that
               "remember" the logical to physical page mappings.  Some
               boards have extra (or alternate) sets of these mapping
               registers.  Because no expanded memory board can supply an
               infinite number of alternate map register sets, this
               specification provides a way to simulate them using Function
               28 (Alternate Map Register Set).


          Examples

               For the examples in this section, assume the hardware
               supports alternate map register sets.  First Windows is
               brought up, then "Reversi" is started.  Then control is
               switched back to the MS-DOS Executive.  For this procedure,
               here are the calls to the expanded memory manager:

                                      Example 1

          Allocate alt reg set           ; Start up the MS-DOS
          (for MS-DOS Executive)         ; Executive

          Set alt reg set
          (for MS-DOS Executive)

          Allocate alt reg set           ; Start up Reversi
          (for Reversi)

          Set alt reg set
          (for Reversi)

          Map pages
          (for Reversi)

          Set alt ret set                ; Switch back to MS-DOS
          (for MS-DOS Executive)         ; Executive












          Operating System Use Of Function 28                           209






               Notice this procedure needed no "get" calls because the
               register set contained all the information needed to save a
               context.  However, using "Get" calls would have no ill
               effects.

                                      Example 2

          Allocate alt reg set           ; Start up MS-DOS
          (for MS-DOS Executive)         ; Executive

          Set alt reg set
          (for MS-DOS Executive)

          Get alt reg set
          (for MS-DOS Executive)

          Allocate alt reg set           ; Start up Reversi
          (for Reversi)

          Set alt reg set
          (for Reversi)

          Map pages
          (for Reversi)

          Get alt reg set
          (for Reversi)

          Set alt reg set                ; Switch back to MS-DOS
          (for MS-DOS Executive)         ; Executive

               The important point to follow is that a Set must always
               precede a Get.  The model of Set then Get is the inverse of
               what interrupt handlers use, which is Get then Set (Get the
               old map context and Set the new one).  Another crucial point
               is that an alternate map register set must have the current
               mapping when allocated; otherwise, the Set will create
               chaos.

               What happens if this is simulated in software?  The same Set
               and Get model applies.  The main difference is where the
               context is saved.

               Since the allocate call is dynamic and there is no limit on
               the number of sets allocated, the OS/E must supply the space
               required.  Device drivers cannot allocate space dynamically,
               since the request would fail.  If the Allocate register set
               call returns a status indicating the alternate map register
               sets aren't supported, the OS/E must allocate space for the
               context.  It must also initialize the context using Function
               15.  At that point it can do the Set, passing a pointer to
               the map context space.  On the Get call, the EMM driver is
               to return a pointer to the same context space.

                                      Example 3

          Allocate alt reg set           ; Start up MS-DOS
          (for MS-DOS Executive)         ; Executive

          Get Page Map

          Set alt reg set
          (for MS-DOS Executive)

          Allocate alt reg set           ; Start up Reversi
          (for Reversi)

          Set alt reg set

          GLOSSARY



               The following terms are used frequently in this specifica-
               tion:


          Allocate                 To reserve a specified amount of
                                   expanded memory pages.

          Application Program      An application program is the program
                                   you write and your customer uses.  Some
                                   categories of application software are
                                   word processors, database managers,
                                   spreadsheet managers, and project
                                   managers.

          Conventional memory      The memory between 0 and 640K bytes,
                                   address range 00000h thru 9FFFFh.

          Deallocate               To return previously allocated expanded
                                   memory to the memory manager.

          EMM                      See Expanded Memory Manager.

          Expanded memory          Expanded memory is memory outside DOS's
                                   640K-byte limit (usually in the range of
                                   C0000h thru EFFFFh).

          Expanded Memory          A device driver that controls the
            Manager (EMM)          interface between DOS application
                                   programs and expanded memory.

          Extended memory          The 15M-byte address range between
                                   100000h thru FFFFFFh available on an
                                   80286 processor when it is operating in
                                   protected virtual address mode.

          Handle                   A value that the EMM assigns and uses to
                                   identify a block of memory requested by
                                   an application program.  All allocated
                                   logical pages are associated with a
                                   particular handle.

          Logical Page             The EMM allocates expanded memory in
                                   units (typically 16K bytes) called
                                   logical pages.

          Mappable Segment         A 16K-byte region of memory which can
                                   have a logical page mapped at it.


          Glossary                                                      212






          Map Registers            The set of registers containing the
                                   current mapping context of the EMM
                                   hardware.

          Mapping                  The process of making a logical page of
                                   memory appear at a physical page.

          Mapping Context          The contents of the mapping registers at
                                   a specific instant.  This context
                                   represents a map state.

          Page Frame               A collection of 16K-byte contiguous
                                   physical pages from which an application
                                   program accesses expanded memory.

          Page Frame               A page frame base address is the
            Base Address           location (in segment format) of the
                                   first byte of the page frame.

          Physical Page            A physical page is the range of memory
                                   addresses occupied by a single 16K-byte
                                   page.

          Raw Page                 The smallest unit of mappable memory
                                   that an expanded memory board can
                                   supply.

          Resident Application     A resident application program is loaded
            Program                by DOS, executes, and remains resident
                                   in the system after it returns control
                                   to DOS.  This type of program occupies
                                   memory and is usually invoked by the
                                   operating system, an application
                                   program, or the hardware.  Some example
                                   of resident application programs are RAM
                                   disks, print spoolers, and "pop-up"
                                   desktop programs.

          Status code              A code that an EMM function returns
                                   which indicates something about the
                                   result of running the function.  Some
                                   status codes indicate whether the
                                   function worked correctly and others may
                                   tell you something about the expanded
                                   memory hardware or software.








          Glossary                                                      213






          Transient Application    A transient application program is
            Program                loaded by DOS, executes, and doesn't
                                   remain in the system after it returns
                                   control to DOS.  After a transient
                                   application program returns control to
                                   DOS, the memory it used is available for
                                   other programs.

          Unmap                    To make a logical page inaccessible for
                                   reading or writing.
