****    Brief Overview of Proposed General MIDI Level 1 Spec   ****
 
  The heart of General MIDI (GM) is the _Instrument Patch Map_, shown in
Table 1 (see below). This is a list of 128 sounds, with corresponding
MIDI program numbers. Most of these are imitative sounds, though the
list includes synth sounds, ethnic instruments and a handful of sound
effects.
  The sounds fall roughtly into sixteen families of eight variations
each. Grouping sounds makes it easy to re-orchestrate a piece using
similar sounds. The Instrument Map isn't the final word on musical
instruments of the world, but it's pretty complete
  General MIDI also includes a _Percusssion Key Map_, show in Table 2
(see below). This mapping derives from the Roland/Sequential mapping
used on early drum machines. As with the Instrument Map, it doesn't
cover every percussive instrument in the world, but it's more than
adequate as a basic set.
  To avoid concerns with channels, GM restricts percussion to MIDI
Channel 10. Theoretically, the lower nine channels are for the
instruments, but the GM spec states that a sound module must respond
to all sixteen MIDI channels, with dynamic voice allocation and a
minimum of 24 voices.
  General MIDI doesn't mention sound quality of synthesis methods.
Discussions are under way on standardizing sound parameters such as
playable range and envelope times. This will ensure that an arrangement
that relies on phrsing and balance can play back on a variety of
modules.
  Other requirements for a GM sound module include response to velocity,
mod wheel, aftertouch, sustain and expression pedal, main volume and
pan, and the All Notes Off and Reset All Controllers messages. The
module  also must respond to both Pitch Bend and Pitch Bend Sensitivity
(a MIDI registered parameter). The default pitch bend range is +-2
semitones.
  Middle C (C3) corresponds to MIDI key 60, and master tuning must be
adjustable.  Finally, the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) created a
new Universal System Exclusive message to turn General MIDI on and off
(for devices that might have "consumer" and "programmable" settings).
Table 3 (see below) summarizes these requirements.
  General MIDI has room for future expansion, including additional drum
and instrument assignments and more required controllers. Also under
discussion is an "authorizing document" that would standardize things
such as channel assignments (e.g., lead on 1, bass on 2, etc.) and setup
information in a MIDI file.
 
Copies of the Level 1 Specification documents for General MIDI ($5 each
at last notice) are available from the Internation MIDI Association,
5316 West 57th Street Los Angeles, CA 90056, (213) 649-6434. The first
issue of the Journal of the MMA (back issues, $15 each) contains an
article by PassPort Designs and Stanley Junglieb about General MIDI.
 
 
Roland's GS Standard
 
  When Warner New Media first proposed a General MIDI standard, most MMA
members gave it little thought. As discussions proceeded, Roland
listened and developed a sound module to meet the proposed
specification. At the same NAMM show where the MMA ratified General MIDI
Level 1, Roland showed their Sound Brush and Sound Canvas, a Standard
MIDI File player and GM-compatible sound module.
  Some companies feel that General MIDI doesn't go far enough, so Roland
created a superset of General MIDI Level 1, which they call GS Standard.
It obeys all the protocols and sound maps of General MIDI and adds many
extra controllers and sounds. Some of the controllers use Unregistered
Parameter Numbers to give macro control over synth parameters such as
envelope attack and decay rates.
  The new MIDI Bank Select message provides access to extra sounds
(including variations on the stock sounds and a re-creation of the MT-32
factory patches). The programs in each bank align with the original 128
in General MIDI's Instrument Patch Map, with eight banks housing related
families. The GS Standard includes a "fall back" system. If the Sound
Canvas receives a request for a bank/program number combination that
does not exist, it will reassign it to the master instrument in that
family. A set of Roland System Exclusive messages allows reconfiguration
and customization of the sound module.
  This means that a Roland GS Standard sound module will correctly play
back any song designed for General MIDI. In addition, if the song's
creator wants to create some extra nuance, they can include the GS
Standard extensions in their sequence. None of these extensions are so
radical as to make the song unplayable on a normal GM sound module.
After all, compatibility is what MIDI - and especially General MIDI - is
all about.
