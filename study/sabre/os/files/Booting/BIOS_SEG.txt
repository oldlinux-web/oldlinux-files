			1 1  reserved
			Apparently VGA BIOS mode set disregards bit 7 and uses
			byte 40h:88h to determine 200/350 selection when bit 4
			is zero. Presumably bit 7 is a convenience for other
			purposes. Bit 7 is reset to zero after the mode set.

					  8 x 8 text font at next mode set
				      Bit unchanged by mode set.

		    bit 2:  =1 if mono display, =0 if color display
		    bit 1:  =1 if gray scale summing enabled, =0 if disabled
