# man_sections
	man_sections (5)

The standard sections of the Unix manual are:
	
     Section 1: User commands - for general users
     Section 2: System calls - primarily for programmers
     Section 3: C library - primarily for programmers
     Section 4: File formats 
     Section 5: Miscellaneous - information that doesn't fit elsewhere
     Section 6: Games and entertainment (unofficial
     Section 7: Special files and devices (in /dev)
     Section 8: Maintenance and installation procedures 

In Minix 1.5 each of these is in a file /usr/man/man1 .. /usr/man/man8.
The man command searches section 1 if no section is specified.

On my system I also have several other non-standard man sections:

	/usr/man/man0 is a condensed man file, with man entries for
some of the Minix-specific utilities needed for initial installation.
Common Unix commands that can be found in standard Unix users' guides
(like cat, cp, ls, etc.) are not included unless their syntax is
non-standard in Minix.

	/usr/man/man9 is for man pages for Atari, Amiga, MacIntosh, and
other non-IBM-PC versions of Minix.

	/usr/man/man1esp .. /usr/man/man8esp are Spanish language versions
of the corresponding sections. These are not as current or complete as 
the English version.

# regular_expressions
  Regular Expressions (5)

	Mined, ed, grep, and other Minix commands use regular expressions
for searching text.

The rules for forming regular expressions are:

1. Every displayable character matches itself.
2. . (period)     matches any character except newline.
3. ^ (circumflex) matches the start of a line.
4. $ (dollar)     matches the end of a line.
5. \c             matches character c, including period, circumflex, dollar, 
		  etc.
6. [<string>]     matches any character in <string>.
7. [^<string>]    matches any character not in the <string>.
8. [x-y]          matches any character including and between x and y (e.g., 
                  [a-z]matches any lower case alphabetic character).
9. <pattern>*     matches any number (0 or more) of occurences of <pattern>. 

Examples of regular expressions:

  The boy  matches the string "The boy"
  ^$	   matches any empty line
  ^.$	   matches any line containing exactly one character
  ^A.*\.$  matches any line beginning with "A" and ending with a period
  ^[A-Z]*$ matches an empty line or any line containing only upper case 
           alphabetic characters
  [A-Z0-9] matches any line containing an upper case letter or a numeric
           digit
  .*X	   matches any line ending in "X"
  A.*B	   matches any line containing an "A" followed (but not necessarily
           immediately) by a "B"

  num-     search back              	ctrl-X exit
  num5     display status of file       ctrl-S shell
  ctrl-]   go to line (by number)       ctrl-\ abort
  ctrl-R   replace (global)          	ctrl-E redraw screen
  ctrl-L   replace (line)           	ctrl-V get (Visit) new file

	Control characters cannot be entered into a file by typing them
directly, because they are all used as editor commands.  To enter a
control character press and release Alt-Escape and then type the
control character.  Control characters in the text are displayed in
reverse video.

	Searches in Mined use regular expressions.

# man_pages
	Man_pages(5)

	Most Unix man commands use a database of individual files, one
for each manual "page".  Each section of the manual occupies a
directory, man<section> and the man command searches through a preset
list of such directories.  Typically these files are formatted for
processing by a text formatter such as nroff, and the man command pipes
the files through the formatter.  It is also common to have a set of
cat<section> directories in which preformatted versions of frequently
accessed man pages are kept.

The Minix 1.5 man command uses text files which are concatenations of
the individual man pages.  The files are in the /usr/man directory, and
are named /usr/man/man<n>.  The <n> suffix is normally a single digit
number, but longer strings may also be used.  Within each man<n> file
pages are delimited by a line with a "#" in the first column, followed
by the various keywords by which the page may be retrieved.  For each
text file there is an index file, which allows the Minix 1.5 man
command to display a menu of the available man commands in each
section.  Man builds new index files whenever it finds that a text file
is newer than the corresponding index file.

Originally Minix was distributed without any man text files in machine
readable form, but with an extensive printed manual.  As upgrades to
Minix became available over the net there was also a need for updated
man text, and man files are now available from various ftp sites.  In
addition, various add-ons to Minix have their own man pages. 

Man pages distributed over the net generally are in the standard Unix form
of one file per subject, containing formatting commands for use with nroff
and the /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.an macro page. Unfortunately many of the man
pages that have been distributed over the net have been written on systems 
with much more sophisticated sets of macros than were distributed with 
Minix, so just using nroff -man to process such a page may not be adequate
to make into readable text. There is a shell script, ast2man, that may 
help to convert some of the man pages written by Andrew Tanenbaum, but 
converting a man page received over the net to a form suitable for
appending to one of the /usr/man/man<n> files may require some polishing
with an editor.

Once a file has been processed and edited, add a line of the form 
"# name1 name2 ..."
to the beginning of the file and append it to the end of the appropriate
/usr/man/man<n> file, and it will be indexed and appear in the menu page
for that man file the next time man is invoked. There is, however, one
"gotcha" in this: When building the index man only uses the first occurence
of every "# name" line; so if you want to add a man page to replace an 
existing entry you must either put your new entry at the beginning of the file
or edit the file to remove the old entry.

The man pages in this version of Minix come from a variety of sources.
Most of them were written by Andrew Tanenbaum and his collaborators.
Many of these apply to modified versions of the original Minix commands
that were released with upgrades to version 1.6, and the performance of
individual commands may not be exactly as indicated in these man pages.
Some pages have been rewritten by asw, or were written by asw and his
students at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua in 1993;
there is an alternative man1esp page with entires in Spanish.  Some
were written by the authors of various add-ons to the original Minix
1.5.  In most cases the author and reviser of a page is indicated in
the text; if no author is credited for a particular entry it was
probably written by Andrew Tanenbaum.
