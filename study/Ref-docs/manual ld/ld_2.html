<H1><A href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_toc.html#TOC2" 
name=SEC2>Invocation</A></H1>
<P>The GNU linker <CODE>ld</CODE> is meant to cover a broad range of situations, 
and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers. As a result, you have 
many choices to control its behavior. </P>
<H2><A href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_toc.html#TOC3" 
name=SEC3>Command Line Options</A></H2>
<P><A name=IDX3></A><A name=IDX4></A>The linker supports a plethora of 
command-line options, but in actual practice few of them are used in any 
particular context. <A name=IDX5></A>For instance, a frequent use of 
<CODE>ld</CODE> is to link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported 
Unix system. On such a system, to link a file <CODE>hello.o</CODE>: </P><PRE>ld -o <VAR>output</VAR> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
</PRE>
<P>This tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to produce a file called <VAR>output</VAR> as the 
result of linking the file <CODE>/lib/crt0.o</CODE> with <CODE>hello.o</CODE> 
and the library <CODE>libc.a</CODE>, which will come from the standard search 
directories. (See the discussion of the <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP> option below.) </P>
<P>The command-line options to <CODE>ld</CODE> may be specified in any order, 
and may be repeated at will. Repeating most options with a different argument 
will either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those further 
to the left on the command line) of that option. Options which may be 
meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the descriptions below. </P>
<P><A name=IDX6></A>Non-option arguments are objects files which are to be 
linked together. They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line 
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between an option 
and its argument. </P>
<P>Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can 
specify other forms of binary input files using <SAMP>`-l'</SAMP>, 
<SAMP>`-R'</SAMP>, and the script command language. If <EM>no</EM> binary input 
files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues 
the message <SAMP>`No input files'</SAMP>. </P>
<P>If the linker can not recognize the format of an object file, it will assume 
that it is a linker script. A script specified in this way augments the main 
linker script used for the link (either the default linker script or the one 
specified by using <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP>). This feature permits the linker to link 
against a file which appears to be an object or an archive, but actually merely 
defines some symbol values, or uses <CODE>INPUT</CODE> or <CODE>GROUP</CODE> to 
load other objects. Note that specifying a script in this way should only be 
used to augment the main linker script; if you want to use some command that 
logically can only appear once, such as the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> or 
<CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command, you must replace the default linker script using 
the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option. See section <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC5">Command 
Language</A>. </P>
<P>For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must either 
follow the option letter without intervening whitespace, or be given as separate 
arguments immediately following the option that requires them. </P>
<P>For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can 
precede the option name; for example, <SAMP>`--oformat'</SAMP> and 
<SAMP>`--oformat'</SAMP> are equivalent. Arguments to multiple-letter options 
must either be separated from the option name by an equals sign, or be given as 
separate arguments immediately following the option that requires them. For 
example, <SAMP>`--oformat srec'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`--oformat=srec'</SAMP> are 
equivalent. Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are 
accepted. </P>
<DL compact>
  <DT><CODE>-a<VAR>keyword</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD><A name=IDX7></A>This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility. The 
  <VAR>keyword</VAR> argument must be one of the strings <SAMP>`archive'</SAMP>, 
  <SAMP>`shared'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`default'</SAMP>. <SAMP>`-aarchive'</SAMP> is 
  functionally equivalent to <SAMP>`-Bstatic'</SAMP>, and the other two keywords 
  are functionally equivalent to <SAMP>`-Bdynamic'</SAMP>. This option may be 
  used any number of times. <A name=IDX8></A><A name=IDX9></A>
  <DT><CODE>-A<VAR>architecture</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD><A name=IDX10></A>
  <DT><CODE>--architecture=<VAR>architecture</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>In the current release of <CODE>ld</CODE>, this option is useful only for 
  the Intel 960 family of architectures. In that <CODE>ld</CODE> configuration, 
  the <VAR>architecture</VAR> argument identifies the particular architecture in 
  the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the archive-library 
  search path. See section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_4.html#SEC29"><CODE>ld</CODE> 
  and the Intel 960 family</A>, for details. Future releases of <CODE>ld</CODE> 
  may support similar functionality for other architecture families. <A

  <DT><CODE>-b <VAR>input-format</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--format=<VAR>input-format</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD><CODE>ld</CODE> may be configured to support more than one kind of object 
  file. If your <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured this way, you can use the 
  <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> option to specify the binary format for input object files 
  that follow this option on the command line. Even when <CODE>ld</CODE> is 
  configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need to 
  specify this, as <CODE>ld</CODE> should be configured to expect as a default 
  input format the most usual format on each machine. <VAR>input-format</VAR> is 
  a text string, the name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries. 
  (You can list the available binary formats with <SAMP>`objdump -i'</SAMP>.) 
  See section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_5.html#SEC30">BFD</A>. 
  You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual 
  binary format. You can also use <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> to switch formats explicitly 
  (when linking object files of different formats), by including <SAMP>`-b 
  <VAR>input-format</VAR>'</SAMP> before each group of object files in a 
  particular format. The default format is taken from the environment variable 
  <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE>. See section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_2.html#SEC4">Environment 
  Variables</A>. You can also define the input format from a script, using the 
  command <CODE>TARGET</CODE>; see section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC26">Option 
  Commands</A>. <A name=IDX16></A><A name=IDX17></A><A name=IDX18></A>
  <DT><CODE>-c <VAR>MRI-commandfile</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--mri-script=<VAR>MRI-commandfile</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <CODE>ld</CODE> accepts 
  script files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described 
  in section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_7.html#SEC37">MRI 
  Compatible Script Files</A>. Introduce MRI script files with the option 
  <SAMP>`-c'</SAMP>; use the <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> option to run linker scripts 
  written in the general-purpose <CODE>ld</CODE> scripting language. If 
  <VAR>MRI-cmdfile</VAR> does not exist, <CODE>ld</CODE> looks for it in the 
  directories specified by any <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> options. <A name=IDX19></A><A 
  name=IDX20></A><A name=IDX21></A><A name=IDX22></A>
  <DT><CODE>-d</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>-dc</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>-dp</CODE> 
  <DD>These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for 
  compatibility with other linkers. They assign space to common symbols even if 
  a relocatable output file is specified (with <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>). The script 
  command <CODE>FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION</CODE> has the same effect. See section 
  <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC26">Option 
  Commands</A>. <A name=IDX23></A><A name=IDX24></A><A name=IDX25></A>
  <DT><CODE>-e <VAR>entry</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--entry=<VAR>entry</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Use <VAR>entry</VAR> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of 
  your program, rather than the default entry point. See section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC24">The 
  Entry Point</A>, for a discussion of defaults and other ways of specifying the 
  entry point. <A name=IDX26></A><A name=IDX27></A><A name=IDX28></A>
  <DT><CODE>-E</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--export-dynamic</CODE> 
  <DD>When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the 
  dynamic symbol table. The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols which are 
  visible from dynamic objects at run time. If you do not use this option, the 
  dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols which are 
  referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link. If you use 
  <CODE>dlopen</CODE> to load a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the 
  symbols defined by the program, rather than some other dynamic object, then 
  you will probably need to use this option when linking the program itself. <A 
  name=IDX29></A><A name=IDX30></A>
  <DT><CODE>-f</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--auxiliary <VAR>name</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field to 
  the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the 
  shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the symbol table of the 
  shared object <VAR>name</VAR>. If you later link a program against this filter 
  object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the 
  DT_AUXILIARY field. If the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter 
  object, it will first check whether there is a definition in the shared object 
  <VAR>name</VAR>. If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition in 
  the filter object. The shared object <VAR>name</VAR> need not exist. Thus the 
  shared object <VAR>name</VAR> may be used to provide an alternative 
  implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for machine 
  specific performance. This option may be specified more than once. The 
  DT_AUXILIARY entries will be created in the order in which they appear on the 
  command line. <A name=IDX31></A><A name=IDX32></A>
  <DT><CODE>-F <VAR>name</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--filter <VAR>name</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to 
  the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of the 
  shared object which is being created should be used as a filter on the symbol 
  table of the shared object <VAR>name</VAR>. If you later link a program 
  against this filter object, then, when you run the program, the dynamic linker 
  will see the DT_FILTER field. The dynamic linker will resolve symbols 
  according to the symbol table of the filter object as usual, but it will 
  actually link to the definitions found in the shared object <VAR>name</VAR>. 
  Thus the filter object can be used to select a subset of the symbols provided 
  by the object <VAR>name</VAR>. Some older linkers used the <CODE>-F</CODE> 
  option throughout a compilation toolchain for specifying object-file format 
  for both input and output object files. The GNU linker uses other mechanisms 
  for this purpose: the <CODE>-b</CODE>, <CODE>--format</CODE>, 
  <CODE>--oformat</CODE> options, the <CODE>TARGET</CODE> command in linker 
  scripts, and the <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> environment variable. The GNU linker 
  will ignore the <CODE>-F</CODE> option when not creating an ELF shared object. 
  <A name=IDX33></A>
  <DT><CODE>--force-exe-suffix</CODE> 
  <DD>Make sure that an output file has a .exe suffix. If a successfully built 
  fully linked output file does not have a <CODE>.exe</CODE> or 
  <CODE>.dll</CODE> suffix, this option forces the linker to copy the output 
  file to one of the same name with a <CODE>.exe</CODE> suffix. This option is 
  useful when using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft Windows host, since 
  some versions of Windows won't run an image unless it ends in a 
  <CODE>.exe</CODE> suffix. <A name=IDX34></A>
  <DT><CODE>-g</CODE> 
  <DD>Ignored. Provided for compatibility with other tools. <A name=IDX35></A><A 
  name=IDX36></A><A name=IDX37></A>
  <DT><CODE>-G<VAR>value</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--gpsize=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to 
  <VAR>size</VAR>. This is only meaningful for object file formats such as MIPS 
  ECOFF which supports putting large and small objects into different sections. 
  This is ignored for other object file formats. <A name=IDX38></A><A 
  name=IDX39></A><A name=IDX40></A>
  <DT><CODE>-h<VAR>name</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>-soname=<VAR>name</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to 
  the specified name. When an executable is linked with a shared object which 
  has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic linker will 
  attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME field rather than 
  the using the file name given to the linker. <A name=IDX41></A><A 
  name=IDX42></A>
  <DT><CODE>-i</CODE> 
  <DD>Perform an incremental link (same as option <SAMP>`-r'</SAMP>). <A 
  name=IDX43></A><A name=IDX44></A><A name=IDX45></A>
  <DT><CODE>-l<VAR>archive</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--library=<VAR>archive</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Add archive file <VAR>archive</VAR> to the list of files to link. This 
  option may be used any number of times. <CODE>ld</CODE> will search its 
  path-list for occurrences of <CODE>lib<VAR>archive</VAR>.a</CODE> for every 
  <VAR>archive</VAR> specified. On systems which support shared libraries, 
  <CODE>ld</CODE> may also search for libraries with extensions other than 
  <CODE>.a</CODE>. Specifically, on ELF and SunOS systems, <CODE>ld</CODE> will 
  search a directory for a library with an extension of <CODE>.so</CODE> before 
  searching for one with an extension of <CODE>.a</CODE>. By convention, a 
  <CODE>.so</CODE> extension indicates a shared library. The linker will search 
  an archive only once, at the location where it is specified on the command 
  line. If the archive defines a symbol which was undefined in some object which 
  appeared before the archive on the command line, the linker will include the 
  appropriate file(s) from the archive. However, an undefined symbol in an 
  object appearing later on the command line will not cause the linker to search 
  the archive again. See the <CODE>-(</CODE> option for a way to force the 
  linker to search archives multiple times. You may list the same archive 
  multiple times on the command line. This type of archive searching is standard 
  for Unix linkers. However, if you are using <CODE>ld</CODE> on AIX, note that 
  it is different from the behaviour of the AIX linker. <A name=IDX46></A><A 
  name=IDX47></A><A name=IDX48></A>
  <DT><CODE>-L<VAR>searchdir</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--library-path=<VAR>searchdir</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Add path <VAR>searchdir</VAR> to the list of paths that <CODE>ld</CODE> 
  will search for archive libraries and <CODE>ld</CODE> control scripts. You may 
  use this option any number of times. The directories are searched in the order 
  in which they are specified on the command line. Directories specified on the 
  command line are searched before the default directories. All <CODE>-L</CODE> 
  options apply to all <CODE>-l</CODE> options, regardless of the order in which 
  the options appear. The default set of paths searched (without being specified 
  with <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP>) depends on which emulation mode <CODE>ld</CODE> is 
  using, and in some cases also on how it was configured. See section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_2.html#SEC4">Environment 
  Variables</A>. The paths can also be specified in a link script with the 
  <CODE>SEARCH_DIR</CODE> command. Directories specified this way are searched 
  at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line. <A 
  name=IDX49></A><A name=IDX50></A>
  <DT><CODE>-m<VAR>emulation</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Emulate the <VAR>emulation</VAR> linker. You can list the available 
  emulations with the <SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> options. If 
  the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option is not used, the emulation is taken from the 
  <CODE>LDEMULATION</CODE> environment variable, if that is defined. Otherwise, 
  the default emulation depends upon how the linker was configured. <A 
  name=IDX51></A><A name=IDX52></A><A name=IDX53></A>
  <DT><CODE>-M</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--print-map</CODE> 
  <DD>Print a link map to the standard output. A link map provides information 
  about the link, including the following: 
  <UL>
    <LI>Where object files and symbols are mapped into memory. 
    <LI>How common symbols are allocated. 
    <LI>All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol 
    which caused the archive member to be brought in. </LI></UL><A 
  name=IDX54></A><A name=IDX55></A><A name=IDX56></A><A name=IDX57></A>
  <DT><CODE>-n</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--nmagic</CODE> 
  <DD>Set the text segment to be read only, and mark the output as 
  <CODE>NMAGIC</CODE> if possible. <A name=IDX58></A><A name=IDX59></A><A 
  name=IDX60></A><A name=IDX61></A>
  <DT><CODE>-N</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--omagic</CODE> 
  <DD>Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable. Also, do not 
  page-align the data segment. If the output format supports Unix style magic 
  numbers, mark the output as <CODE>OMAGIC</CODE>. <A name=IDX62></A><A 
  name=IDX63></A><A name=IDX64></A>
  <DT><CODE>-o <VAR>output</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--output=<VAR>output</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Use <VAR>output</VAR> as the name for the program produced by 
  <CODE>ld</CODE>; if this option is not specified, the name <TT>`a.out'</TT> is 
  used by default. The script command <CODE>OUTPUT</CODE> can also specify the 
  output file name. <A name=IDX65></A><A name=IDX66></A><A name=IDX67></A><A 
  name=IDX68></A>
  <DT><CODE>-r</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--relocateable</CODE> 
  <DD>Generate relocatable output--i.e., generate an output file that can in 
  turn serve as input to <CODE>ld</CODE>. This is often called <EM>partial 
  linking</EM>. As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix 
  magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to 
  <CODE>OMAGIC</CODE>. If this option is not specified, an absolute file is 
  produced. When linking C++ programs, this option <EM>will not</EM> resolve 
  references to constructors; to do that, use <SAMP>`-Ur'</SAMP>. This option 
  does the same thing as <SAMP>`-i'</SAMP>. <A name=IDX69></A><A 
  name=IDX70></A><A name=IDX71></A>
  <DT><CODE>-R <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--just-symbols=<VAR>filename</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Read symbol names and their addresses from <VAR>filename</VAR>, but do not 
  relocate it or include it in the output. This allows your output file to refer 
  symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other programs. You 
  may use this option more than once. For compatibility with other ELF linkers, 
  if the <CODE>-R</CODE> option is followed by a directory name, rather than a 
  file name, it is treated as the <CODE>-rpath</CODE> option. <A 
  name=IDX72></A><A name=IDX73></A><A name=IDX74></A>
  <DT><CODE>-s</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--strip-all</CODE> 
  <DD>Omit all symbol information from the output file. <A name=IDX75></A><A 
  name=IDX76></A><A name=IDX77></A>
  <DT><CODE>-S</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--strip-debug</CODE> 
  <DD>Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output 
  file. <A name=IDX78></A><A name=IDX79></A><A name=IDX80></A>
  <DT><CODE>-t</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--trace</CODE> 
  <DD>Print the names of the input files as <CODE>ld</CODE> processes them. <A 
  name=IDX81></A><A name=IDX82></A><A name=IDX83></A>
  <DT><CODE>-T <VAR>commandfile</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--script=<VAR>commandfile</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Read link commands from the file <VAR>commandfile</VAR>. These commands 
  replace <CODE>ld</CODE>'s default link script (rather than adding to it), so 
  <VAR>commandfile</VAR> must specify everything necessary to describe the 
  target format. You must use this option if you want to use a command which can 
  only appear once in a linker script, such as the <CODE>SECTIONS</CODE> or 
  <CODE>MEMORY</CODE> command. See section <A 
  href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_3.html#SEC5">Command 
  Language</A>. If <VAR>commandfile</VAR> does not exist, <CODE>ld</CODE> looks 
  for it in the directories specified by any preceding <SAMP>`-L'</SAMP> 
  options. Multiple <SAMP>`-T'</SAMP> options accumulate. <A name=IDX84></A><A 
  name=IDX85></A><A name=IDX86></A>
  <DT><CODE>-u <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--undefined=<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Force <VAR>symbol</VAR> to be entered in the output file as an undefined 
  symbol. Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional modules 
  from standard libraries. <SAMP>`-u'</SAMP> may be repeated with different 
  option arguments to enter additional undefined symbols. <A name=IDX87></A><A

  <DT><CODE>-v</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--version</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>-V</CODE> 
  <DD>Display the version number for <CODE>ld</CODE>. The <CODE>-V</CODE> option 
  also lists the supported emulations. <A name=IDX91></A><A name=IDX92></A><A 
  name=IDX93></A>

  name=IDX96></A><A name=IDX97></A>
  <DT><CODE>-X</CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--discard-locals</CODE> 
  <DD>Delete all temporary local symbols. For most targets, this is all local 
  symbols whose names begin with <SAMP>`L'</SAMP>. <A name=IDX98></A><A

  <DT><CODE>-y <VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>
  <DT><CODE>--trace-symbol=<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>Print the name of each linked file in which <VAR>symbol</VAR> appears. 
  This option may be given any number of times. On many systems it is necessary 
  to prepend an underscore. This option is useful when you have an undefined 
  symbol in your link but don't know where the reference is coming from. <A

  specified on the command line. If a symbol in that archive is needed to 
  resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an object in an archive that 
  appears later on the command line, the linker would not be able to resolve 
  that reference. By grouping the archives, they all be searched repeatedly 
  until all possible references are resolved. Using this option has a

  <DT><CODE>--cref</CODE> 
  <DD>Output a cross reference table. If a linker map file is being generated, 
  the cross reference table is printed to the map file. Otherwise, it is printed 
  on the standard output. The format of the table is intentionally simple, so 
  that it may be easily processed by a script if necessary. The symbols are 
  printed out, sorted by name. For each symbol, a list of file names is given.

  necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line. A limited form of 
  arithmetic is supported for the <VAR>expression</VAR> in this context: you may 
  give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing symbol, or use 
  <CODE>+</CODE> and <CODE>-</CODE> to add or subtract hexadecimal constants or 
  symbols. If you need more elaborate expressions, consider using the linker

  <DT><CODE>--no-keep-memory</CODE> 
  <DD><CODE>ld</CODE> normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching

  while linking a large executable. <A name=IDX133></A>
  <DT><CODE>--no-warn-mismatch</CODE> 
  <DD>Normally <CODE>ld</CODE> will give an error if you try to link together 
  input files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they have 
  been compiled for different processors or for different endiannesses. This 
  option tells <CODE>ld</CODE> that it should silently permit such possible

  whatsoever. <A name=IDX137></A>
  <DT><CODE>--oformat <VAR>output-format</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD><CODE>ld</CODE> may be configured to support more than one kind of object

  object file. Even when <CODE>ld</CODE> is configured to support alternative 
  object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as <CODE>ld</CODE> 
  should be configured to produce as a default output format the most usual 
  format on each machine. <VAR>output-format</VAR> is a text string, the name of 
  a particular format supported by the BFD libraries. (You can list the 
  available binary formats with <SAMP>`objdump -i'</SAMP>.) The script command 
  <CODE>OUTPUT_FORMAT</CODE> can also specify the output format, but this option

  <DD>Retain <EM>only</EM> the symbols listed in the file <VAR>filename</VAR>, 
  discarding all others. <VAR>filename</VAR> is simply a flat file, with one 
  symbol name per line. This option is especially useful in environments (such 
  as VxWorks) where a large global symbol table is accumulated gradually, to 
  conserve run-time memory. <SAMP>`--retain-symbols-file'</SAMP> does 
  <EM>not</EM> discard undefined symbols, or symbols needed for relocations. You 
  may only specify <SAMP>`--retain-symbols-file'</SAMP> once in the command

  <DT><CODE>-rpath <VAR>dir</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD><A name=IDX146></A><A name=IDX147></A>Add a directory to the runtime 
  library search path. This is used when linking an ELF executable with shared 
  objects. All <CODE>-rpath</CODE> arguments are concatenated and passed to the 
  runtime linker, which uses them to locate shared objects at runtime. The 
  <CODE>-rpath</CODE> option is also used when locating shared objects which are 
  needed by shared objects explicitly included in the link; see the description 
  of the <CODE>-rpath-link</CODE> option. If <CODE>-rpath</CODE> is not used 
  when linking an ELF executable, the contents of the environment variable 
  <CODE>LD_RUN_PATH</CODE> will be used if it is defined. The 
  <CODE>-rpath</CODE> option may also be used on SunOS. By default, on SunOS, 
  the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the <CODE>-L</CODE> 
  options it is given. If a <CODE>-rpath</CODE> option is used, the runtime 
  search path will be formed exclusively using the <CODE>-rpath</CODE> options, 
  ignoring the <CODE>-L</CODE> options. This can be useful when using gcc, which 
  adds many <CODE>-L</CODE> options which may be on NFS mounted filesystems. For 
  compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the <CODE>-R</CODE> option is 
  followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as the 
  <CODE>-rpath</CODE> option. <A name=IDX148></A><A name=IDX149></A>
  <DT><CODE>-rpath-link <VAR>DIR</VAR></CODE> 
  <DD>When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another. This 
  happens when an <CODE>ld -shared</CODE> link includes a shared library as one 
  of the input files. When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a 
  non-shared, non-relocateable link, it will automatically try to locate the 
  required shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included 
  explicitly. In such a case, the <CODE>-rpath-link</CODE> option specifies the 
  first set of directories to search. The <CODE>-rpath-link</CODE> option may 
  specify a sequence of directory names either by specifying a list of names 
  separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times. The linker uses the 
  following search paths to locate required shared libraries. 
  <OL>
    <LI>Any directories specified by <CODE>-rpath-link</CODE> options. 
    <LI>Any directories specified by <CODE>-rpath</CODE> options. The difference

    specified by <CODE>-rpath</CODE> options are included in the executable and 
    used at runtime, whereas the <CODE>-rpath-link</CODE> option is only 
    effective at link time. 
    <LI>On an ELF system, if the <CODE>-rpath</CODE> and <CODE>rpath-link</CODE>

  <DT><CODE>--sort-common</CODE> 
  <DD><A name=IDX153></A>This option tells <CODE>ld</CODE> to sort the common

  useful when generating huge relocatable for downloading into certain real time 
  kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF cannot represent more 
  than 65535 relocations in a single section. Note that this will fail to work 
  with object file formats which do not support arbitrary sections. The linker 
  will not split up individual input sections for redistribution, so if a single 
  input section contains more than <VAR>count</VAR> relocations one output

  <DD>Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with a 
  symbol definition. Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice, but 
  linkers on some other operating systems do not. This option allows you to find 
  potential problems from combining global symbols. Unfortunately, some C 
  libraries use this practice, so you may get some warnings about symbols in the 
  libraries as well as in your programs. There are three kinds of global 
  symbols, illustrated here by C examples: 
  <DL compact>
    <DT><SAMP>`int i = 1;'</SAMP> 
    <DD>A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output

    <DD>An undefined reference, which does not allocate space. There must be 
    either a definition or a common symbol for the variable somewhere. 
    <DT><SAMP>`int i;'</SAMP> 
    <DD>A common symbol. If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a 
    variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file. The 
    linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a single 
    symbol. If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest size. The 
    linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is a definition of 
    the same variable. </DD></DL>The <SAMP>`--warn-common'</SAMP> option can 
  produce five kinds of warnings. Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the 
  first describes the symbol just encountered, and the second describes the 
  previous symbol encountered with the same name. One or both of the two symbols 
  will be a common symbol.

  <DT><CODE>--warn-multiple-gp</CODE> 
  <DD>Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file. 
  This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha. 
  Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special section. 
  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle of this 
  section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a base-register 
  relative addressing mode. Since the offset in base-register relative mode is 
  fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits the maximum size of 
  the constant pool. Thus, in large programs, it is often necessary to use 
  multiple global pointer values in order to be able to address all possible 
  constants. This option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case 
  occurs. <A name=IDX175></A><A name=IDX176></A><A name=IDX177></A>

  Any undefined reference to <CODE>__real_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE> will be 
  resolved to <VAR>symbol</VAR>. This can be used to provide a wrapper for a 
  system function. The wrapper function should be called 
  <CODE>__wrap_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>. If it wishes to call the system 
  function, it should call <CODE>__real_<VAR>symbol</VAR></CODE>. Here is a 
  trivial example: <PRE>void *
__wrap_malloc (int c)
{
  printf ("malloc called with %ld\n", c);
  return __real_malloc (c);
}
</PRE>If you link other code with this file using <CODE>--wrap malloc</CODE>, 
  then all calls to <CODE>malloc</CODE> will call the function 
  <CODE>__wrap_malloc</CODE> instead. The call to <CODE>__real_malloc</CODE> in 
  <CODE>__wrap_malloc</CODE> will call the real <CODE>malloc</CODE> function. 
  You may wish to provide a <CODE>__real_malloc</CODE> function as well, so that 
  links without the <CODE>--wrap</CODE> option will succeed. If you do this, you 
  should not put the definition of <CODE>__real_malloc</CODE> in the same file 
  as <CODE>__wrap_malloc</CODE>; if you do, the assembler may resolve the call 
  before the linker has a chance to wrap it to <CODE>malloc</CODE>. </DD></DL>

<P><A name=IDX184></A><A name=IDX185></A><CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> determines the 
input-file object format if you don't use <SAMP>`-b'</SAMP> (or its synonym 
<SAMP>`--format'</SAMP>). Its value should be one of the BFD names for an input 
format (see section <A 
href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/ld-2.9.1/html_chapter/ld_5.html#SEC30">BFD</A>). 
If there is no <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> in the environment, <CODE>ld</CODE> uses 
the natural format of the target. If <CODE>GNUTARGET</CODE> is set to 
<CODE>default</CODE> then BFD attempts to discover the input format by examining 
binary input files; this method often succeeds, but there are potential 
ambiguities, since there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to 
specify object-file formats is unique. However, the configuration procedure for 
BFD on each system places the conventional format for that system first in the 
search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention. </P>
<P><A name=IDX186></A><A name=IDX187></A><A 
name=IDX188></A><CODE>LDEMULATION</CODE> determines the default emulation if you 
don't use the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option. The emulation can affect various aspects 
of linker behaviour, particularly the default linker script. You can list the 
available emulations with the <SAMP>`--verbose'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-V'</SAMP> 
options. If the <SAMP>`-m'</SAMP> option is not used, and the 
<CODE>LDEMULATION</CODE> environment variable is not defined, the default 
emulation depends upon how the linker was configured. </P>
