<CODE>ld</CODE> combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run <CODE>ld</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>ld</CODE> accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of AT&#38;T's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.

</P>
<P>
This version of <CODE>ld</CODE> uses the general purpose BFD libraries
to operate on object files. This allows <CODE>ld</CODE> to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats--for example, COFF or
<CODE>a.out</CODE>.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.  See section <A HREF="ld_5.html#SEC30">BFD</A>, for more information.

</P>
<P>
Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
<CODE>ld</CODE> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
