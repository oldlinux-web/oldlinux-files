<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-ac</CODE>
<DD>
omit false conditionals

<DT><CODE>-ad</CODE>
<DD>
omit debugging directives

<DT><CODE>-ah</CODE>

You may combine these options; for example, use <SAMP>`-aln'</SAMP> for assembly
listing without forms processing.  The <SAMP>`=file'</SAMP> option, if used, must be
the last one.  By itself, <SAMP>`-a'</SAMP> defaults to <SAMP>`-ahls'</SAMP>.

<DT><CODE>-D</CODE>
<DD>
Ignored.  This option is accepted for script compatibility with calls to
other assemblers.

<DT><CODE>--defsym <VAR>sym</VAR>=<VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Define the symbol <VAR>sym</VAR> to be <VAR>value</VAR> before assembling the input file.
<VAR>value</VAR> must be an integer constant.  As in C, a leading <SAMP>`0x'</SAMP>
indicates a hexadecimal value, and a leading <SAMP>`0'</SAMP> indicates an octal value.

<DT><CODE>-f</CODE>
<DD>
"fast"---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume source is
compiler output).

<DT><CODE>--gstabs</CODE>
<DD>
Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.  This
may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can handle it.

<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-l</CODE>
<DD>
Shorten references to undefined symbols, to one word instead of two.

<DT><CODE>-m68000 | -m68008 | -m68010 | -m68020 | -m68030 | -m68040 | -m68060</CODE>

<DT><CODE>| -m68302 | -m68331 | -m68332 | -m68333 | -m68340 | -mcpu32 | -m5200</CODE>
<DD>
Specify what processor in the 68000 family is the target.  The default
is normally the 68020, but this can be changed at configuration time.

<DT><CODE>-m68881 | -m68882 | -mno-68881 | -mno-68882</CODE>
<DD>
The target machine does (or does not) have a floating-point coprocessor.
The default is to assume a coprocessor for 68020, 68030, and cpu32.  Although
the basic 68000 is not compatible with the 68881, a combination of the
two can be specified, since it's possible to do emulation of the
coprocessor instructions with the main processor.

<DT><CODE>-m68851 | -mno-68851</CODE>
<DD>
The target machine does (or does not) have a memory-management
unit coprocessor.  The default is to assume an MMU for 68020 and up.

</DL>

<P>
The following options are available when <CODE>as</CODE> is configured
for the SPARC architecture:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a</CODE>
<DD>
Explicitly select a variant of the SPARC architecture.

<SAMP>`-Av8plus'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Av8plusa'</SAMP> select a 32 bit environment.
<SAMP>`-Av9'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Av9a'</SAMP> select a 64 bit environment.

<SAMP>`-Av8plusa'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`-Av9a'</SAMP> enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
UltraSPARC extensions.

<DT><CODE>-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa</CODE>
<DD>
For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.

<DT><CODE>-bump</CODE>
<DD>
Warn when the assembler switches to another architecture.
</DL>

<P>
The following options are available when as is configured for
a MIPS processor.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-G <VAR>num</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
This option sets the largest size of an object that can be referenced
implicitly with the <CODE>gp</CODE> register.  It is only accepted for targets that
use ECOFF format, such as a DECstation running Ultrix.  The default value is 8.

<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<DT><CODE>-EB</CODE>
<DD>
Generate "big endian" format output.

<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
<DT><CODE>-EL</CODE>
<DD>
Generate "little endian" format output.

<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<DT><CODE>-mips1</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-mips2</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-mips3</CODE>
<DD>
Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture level.
<SAMP>`-mips1'</SAMP> corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
<SAMP>`-mips2'</SAMP> to the R6000 processor, and <SAMP>`-mips3'</SAMP> to the R4000
processor.

<DT><CODE>-m4650</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>-no-m4650</CODE>
<DD>
Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler to accept
the <SAMP>`mad'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`madu'</SAMP> instruction, and to not schedule <SAMP>`nop'</SAMP>
instructions around accesses to the <SAMP>`HI'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`LO'</SAMP> registers.
<SAMP>`-no-m4650'</SAMP> turns off this option.

<DT><CODE>-mcpu=<VAR>CPU</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  This has little effect on the
assembler, but it is passed by <CODE>gcc</CODE>.

<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
<DT><CODE>--emulation=<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
This option causes <CODE>as</CODE> to emulate <CODE>as</CODE> configured
for some other target, in all respects, including output format (choosing
between ELF and ECOFF only), handling of pseudo-opcodes which may generate
debugging information or store symbol table information, and default
endianness.  The available configuration names are: <SAMP>`mipsecoff'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`mipself'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`mipslecoff'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`mipsbecoff'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`mipslelf'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`mipsbelf'</SAMP>.  The first two do not alter the default endianness from that
of the primary target for which the assembler was configured; the others change
the default to little- or big-endian as indicated by the <SAMP>`b'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`l'</SAMP>
in the name.  Using <SAMP>`-EB'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`-EL'</SAMP> will override the endianness
selection in any case.

This option is currently supported only when the primary target
<CODE>as</CODE> is configured for is a MIPS ELF or ECOFF target.
Furthermore, the primary target or others specified with
<SAMP>`--enable-targets=...'</SAMP> at configuration time must include support for
the other format, if both are to be available.  For example, the Irix 5
configuration includes support for both.

Eventually, this option will support more configurations, with more
fine-grained control over the assembler's behavior, and will be supported for
more processors.

<DT><CODE>-nocpp</CODE>
<DD>
<CODE>as</CODE> ignores this option.  It is accepted for compatibility with
the native tools.

<DT><CODE>--trap</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--no-trap</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--break</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--no-break</CODE>
<DD>
Control how to deal with multiplication overflow and division by zero.
<SAMP>`--trap'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--no-break'</SAMP> (which are synonyms) take a trap exception
(and only work for Instruction Set Architecture level 2 and higher);
<SAMP>`--break'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`--no-trap'</SAMP> (also synonyms, and the default) take a
break exception.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC2">Structure of this Manual</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
This manual is intended to describe what you need to know to use
GNU <CODE>as</CODE>.  We cover the syntax expected in source files, including
notation for symbols, constants, and expressions; the directives that
<CODE>as</CODE> understands; and of course how to invoke <CODE>as</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
This manual also describes some of the machine-dependent features of
various flavors of the assembler.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
On the other hand, this manual is <EM>not</EM> intended as an introduction
to programming in assembly language--let alone programming in general!
In a similar vein, we make no attempt to introduce the machine
architecture; we do <EM>not</EM> describe the instruction set, standard
mnemonics, registers or addressing modes that are standard to a
particular architecture.
You may want to consult the manufacturer's
machine architecture manual for this information.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC3">The GNU Assembler</A></H2>

<P>
GNU <CODE>as</CODE> is really a family of assemblers.
If you use (or have used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you
should find a fairly similar environment when you use it on another
architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,
including object file formats, most assembler directives (often called
<EM>pseudo-ops</EM>) and assembler syntax.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<CODE>as</CODE> is primarily intended to assemble the output of the
GNU C compiler <CODE>gcc</CODE> for use by the linker
<CODE>ld</CODE>.  Nevertheless, we've tried to make <CODE>as</CODE>
assemble correctly everything that other assemblers for the same
machine would assemble.
Any exceptions are documented explicitly (see section <A HREF="as_8.html#SEC138">Machine Dependent Features</A>).
This doesn't mean <CODE>as</CODE> always uses the same syntax as another
assembler for the same architecture; for example, we know of several
incompatible versions of 680x0 assembly language syntax.

</P>
<P>
Unlike older assemblers, <CODE>as</CODE> is designed to assemble a source
program in one pass of the source file.  This has a subtle impact on the
<KBD>.org</KBD> directive (see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC112"><CODE>.org <VAR>new-lc</CODE> , <VAR>fill</VAR></VAR></A>).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC4">Object File Formats</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
The GNU assembler can be configured to produce several alternative
object file formats.  For the most part, this does not affect how you
write assembly language programs; but directives for debugging symbols
are typically different in different file formats.  See section <A HREF="as_5.html#SEC50">Symbol Attributes</A>.
On the machine specific, <CODE>as</CODE> can be configured to produce either
<CODE>a.out</CODE> or COFF format object files.
On the machine specific, <CODE>as</CODE> can be configured to produce either
<CODE>b.out</CODE> or COFF format object files.
On the machine specific, <CODE>as</CODE> can be configured to produce either
SOM or ELF format object files.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC5">Command Line</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
After the program name <CODE>as</CODE>, the command line may contain
options and file names.  Options may appear in any order, and may be
before, after, or between file names.  The order of file names is
significant.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<TT>`--'</TT> (two hyphens) by itself names the standard input file
explicitly, as one of the files for <CODE>as</CODE> to assemble.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
Except for <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> any command line argument that begins with a
hyphen (<SAMP>`-'</SAMP>) is an option.  Each option changes the behavior of
<CODE>as</CODE>.  No option changes the way another option works.  An
option is a <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> followed by one or more letters; the case of
the letter is important.   All options are optional.

</P>
<P>
Some options expect exactly one file name to follow them.  The file
name may either immediately follow the option's letter (compatible
with older assemblers) or it may be the next command argument (GNU
standard).  These two command lines are equivalent:

</P>

<PRE>
as -o my-object-file.o mumble.s
as -omy-object-file.o mumble.s
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC6">Input Files</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
We use the phrase <EM>source program</EM>, abbreviated <EM>source</EM>, to
describe the program input to one run of <CODE>as</CODE>.  The program may
be in one or more files; how the source is partitioned into files
doesn't change the meaning of the source.

</P>
<P>
The source program is a concatenation of the text in all the files, in the
order specified.

</P>
<P>
Each time you run <CODE>as</CODE> it assembles exactly one source
program.  The source program is made up of one or more files.
(The standard input is also a file.)

</P>
<P>
You give <CODE>as</CODE> a command line that has zero or more input file
names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).  A
command line argument (in any position) that has no special meaning
is taken to be an input file name.

</P>
<P>
If you give <CODE>as</CODE> no file names it attempts to read one input file
from the <CODE>as</CODE> standard input, which is normally your terminal.  You
may have to type <KBD>ctl-D</KBD> to tell <CODE>as</CODE> there is no more program
to assemble.

</P>
<P>
Use <SAMP>`--'</SAMP> if you need to explicitly name the standard input file
in your command line.

</P>
<P>
If the source is empty, <CODE>as</CODE> produces a small, empty object
file.

</P>

<H3>Filenames and Line-numbers</H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
There are two ways of locating a line in the input file (or files) and
either may be used in reporting error messages.  One way refers to a line
number in a physical file; the other refers to a line number in a
"logical" file.  See section <A HREF="as_1.html#SEC8">Error and Warning Messages</A>.

</P>
<P>
<EM>Physical files</EM> are those files named in the command line given
to <CODE>as</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<EM>Logical files</EM> are simply names declared explicitly by assembler
directives; they bear no relation to physical files.  Logical file names
help error messages reflect the original source file, when <CODE>as</CODE>
source is itself synthesized from other files.
See section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC71"><CODE>.app-file <VAR>string</CODE></VAR></A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC7">Output (Object) File</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
Every time you run <CODE>as</CODE> it produces an output file, which is
your assembly language program translated into numbers.  This file
is the object file.  Its default name is
<CODE>a.out</CODE>, or 
<CODE>b.out</CODE> when <CODE>as</CODE> is configured for the Intel 80960.
You can give it another name by using the <CODE>-o</CODE> option.  Conventionally,
object file names end with <TT>`.o'</TT>.  The default name is used for historical
reasons: older assemblers were capable of assembling self-contained programs
directly into a runnable program.  (For some formats, this isn't currently
possible, but it can be done for the <CODE>a.out</CODE> format.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
The object file is meant for input to the linker <CODE>ld</CODE>.  It contains
assembled program code, information to help <CODE>ld</CODE> integrate
the assembled program into a runnable file, and (optionally) symbolic
information for the debugger.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="as_toc.html#TOC8">Error and Warning Messages</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<CODE>as</CODE> may write warnings and error messages to the standard error
file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a compiler
runs <CODE>as</CODE> automatically.  Warnings report an assumption made so
that <CODE>as</CODE> could keep assembling a flawed program; errors report a
grave problem that stops the assembly.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
Warning messages have the format

</P>

<PRE>
file_name:<B>NNN</B>:Warning Message Text
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
(where <B>NNN</B> is a line number).  If a logical file name has been given
(see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC71"><CODE>.app-file <VAR>string</CODE></VAR></A>) it is used for the filename,
otherwise the name of the current input file is used.  If a logical line
number was given
(see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC103"><CODE>.line <VAR>line-number</CODE></VAR></A>)
(see section <A HREF="as_7.html#SEC105"><CODE>.ln <VAR>line-number</CODE></VAR></A>)
then it is used to calculate the number printed,
otherwise the actual line in the current source file is printed.  The
message text is intended to be self explanatory (in the grand Unix
tradition).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
Error messages have the format

<PRE>
file_name:<B>NNN</B>:FATAL:Error Message Text
</PRE>

<P>
The file name and line number are derived as for warning
messages.  The actual message text may be rather less explanatory
because many of them aren't supposed to happen.
