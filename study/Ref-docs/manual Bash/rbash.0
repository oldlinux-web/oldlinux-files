       rbash - restricted bash, see bbaasshh(1)

       If  bbaasshh  is started with the name rrbbaasshh, or the --rr option
       is supplied at invocation, the shell  becomes  restricted.
       A  restricted  shell is used to set up an environment more
       controlled than the standard shell.   It  behaves  identi-
       cally  to  bbaasshh  with the exception that the following are
       disallowed or not performed:

       +o      changing directories with ccdd

       +o      setting or unsetting the  values  of  SSHHEELLLL,  PPAATTHH,
              EENNVV, or BBAASSHH__EENNVV

       +o      specifying command names containing //

       +o      specifying  a  file name containing a // as an argu-
              ment to the ..  builtin command

       +o      Specifying a filename  containing  a  slash  as  an
              argument  to the --pp option to the hhaasshh builtin com-
              mand

       +o      importing function definitions from the shell envi-
              ronment at startup

       +o      parsing the value of SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS from the shell envi-
              ronment at startup

       +o      redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and
              >> redirection operators

       +o      using the eexxeecc builtin command to replace the shell
              with another command

       +o      adding or deleting builtin commands with the --ff and
              --dd options to the eennaabbllee builtin command

       +o      specifying  the  --pp  option  to the ccoommmmaanndd builtin
              command

       +o      turning off restricted mode with sseett ++rr or  sseett  ++oo
              rreessttrriicctteedd.

       These  restrictions  are  enforced after any startup files
       are read.

       When a command that is found to be a shell script is  exe-
       cuted  (see  CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN above), rrbbaasshh turns off any
       restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
