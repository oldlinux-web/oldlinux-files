<p>Normative references for IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 are defined in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_04"></a>Change History</h3>

<p>Change history is described in the Rationale (Informative) volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, and in the CHANGE HISTORY
section of reference pages.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_05"></a>Terminology</h3>

<p>This section appears in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but is repeated here for convenience:</p>

<p>For the purposes of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the following terminology definitions apply:</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_01"></a>can</h4>

<p>Describes a permissible optional feature or behavior available to the user or application. The feature or behavior is mandatory
for an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application can rely on the existence of the feature or
behavior.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_02"></a>implementation-defined</h4>

<p>Describes a value or behavior that is not defined by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 but is selected by an implementor. The value
or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application should not rely on the
existence of the value or behavior. An application that relies on such a value or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across
conforming implementations.</p>

<p>The implementor shall document such a value or behavior so that it can be used correctly by an application.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_03"></a>legacy</h4>

<p>Describes a feature or behavior that is being retained for compatibility with older applications, but which has limitations
which make it inappropriate for developing portable applications. New applications should use alternative means of obtaining
equivalent functionality.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_04"></a>may</h4>

<p>Describes a feature or behavior that is optional for an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An
application should not rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a feature or behavior
cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<p>To avoid ambiguity, the opposite of <i>may</i> is expressed as <i>need not</i>, instead of <i>may not</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_05"></a>shall</h4>

<p>For an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, describes a feature or behavior that is mandatory. An
application can rely on the existence of the feature or behavior.</p>

<p>For an application or user, describes a behavior that is mandatory.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_06"></a>should</h4>

<p>For an implementation that conforms to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, describes a feature or behavior that is recommended but
not mandatory. An application should not rely on the existence of the feature or behavior. An application that relies on such a
feature or behavior cannot be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<p>For an application, describes a feature or behavior that is recommended programming practice for optimum portability.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_07"></a>undefined</h4>

<p>Describes the nature of a value or behavior not defined by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 which results from use of an invalid
program construct or invalid data input.</p>

<p>The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application should not
rely on the existence or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular value or behavior cannot
be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_08"></a>unspecified</h4>

<p>Describes the nature of a value or behavior not specified by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 which results from use of a valid
program construct or valid data input.</p>

<p>The value or behavior may vary among implementations that conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. An application should not
rely on the existence or validity of the value or behavior. An application that relies on any particular value or behavior cannot
be assured to be portable across conforming implementations.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_06"></a>Definitions</h3>

<p>Concepts and definitions are defined in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_07"></a>Relationship to Other Formal Standards</h3>

<p>Great care has been taken to ensure that this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is fully aligned with the following
standards:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>ISO C (1999)</dt>

<dd><br>
ISO/IEC 9899:1999, Programming Languages - C.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Parts of the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard (hereinafter referred to as the ISO&nbsp;C standard) are referenced to describe
requirements also mandated by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Some functions and headers included within this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 have a version in the ISO&nbsp;C standard; in this case CX markings are added as appropriate to
show where the ISO&nbsp;C standard has been extended (see <a href="#tag_01_08_01">Codes</a> ). Any conflict between this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 also allows, but does not require, mathematics functions to support
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;754-1985 and IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;854-1987.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_01_08"></a>Portability</h3>

<p>Some of the utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and functions in the System Interfaces
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 describe functionality that might not be fully portable to systems meeting the
requirements for POSIX conformance (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href=
"../basedefs/xbd_chap02.html#tag_02">Chapter 2, Conformance</a>).</p>

<p>Where optional, enhanced, or reduced functionality is specified, the text is shaded and a code in the margin identifies the
nature of the option, extension, or warning (see <a href="#tag_01_08_01">Codes</a> ). For maximum portability, an application
should avoid such functionality.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_08_01"></a>Codes</h4>

<h3><a name="tag_01_09"></a>Format of Entries</h3>

<p>The entries in <a href="xsh_chap03.html#tag_03"><i>System Interfaces</i></a> are based on a common format as follows. The only
sections relating to conformance are the SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, RETURN VALUE, and ERRORS sections.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>NAME</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section gives the name or names of the entry and briefly states its purpose.</dd>

<dt><b>SYNOPSIS</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section summarizes the use of the entry being described. If it is necessary to include a header to use this function, the
names of such headers are shown, for example: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</dd>

<dt><b>DESCRIPTION</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section describes the functionality of the function or header.</dd>

<dt><b>RETURN VALUE</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section indicates the possible return values, if any. 

<p>If the implementation can detect errors, &quot;successful completion&quot; means that no error has been detected during execution of the
function. If the implementation does detect an error, the error is indicated.</p>

<p>For functions where no errors are defined, &quot;successful completion&quot; means that if the implementation checks for errors, no
error has been detected. If the implementation can detect errors, and an error is detected, the indicated return value is returned
and <i>errno</i> may be set.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>ERRORS</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section gives the symbolic names of the error values returned by a function or stored into a variable accessed through the
symbol <i>errno</i> if an error occurs. 

<p>``No errors are defined&quot; means that error values returned by a function or stored into a variable accessed through the symbol
<i>errno</i>, if any, depend on the implementation.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>EXAMPLES</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section is informative. 

<p>This section gives examples of usage, where appropriate. In the event of conflict between an example and a normative part of
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the normative material is to be taken as correct.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>APPLICATION USAGE</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section is informative. 

<p>This section gives warnings and advice to application writers about the entry. In the event of conflict between warnings and
advice and a normative part of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the normative material is to be taken as correct.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>RATIONALE</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section is informative. 

<p>This section contains historical information concerning the contents of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 and why
features were included or discarded by the standard developers.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</b></dt>

<dd><br>
This section is informative. 

<p>This section provides comments which should be used as a guide to current thinking; there is not necessarily a commitment to
adopt these future directions.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>SEE ALSO</b></dt>
