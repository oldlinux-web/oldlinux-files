<h3><a name="tag_02_03"></a>Error Numbers</h3>

<p>Most functions can provide an error number. The means by which each function provides its error numbers is specified in its
description.</p>

<p>Some functions provide the error number in a variable accessed through the symbol <i>errno</i>. The symbol <i>errno</i>, defined
by including the <a href="../basedefs/errno.h.html"><i>&lt;errno.h&gt;</i></a> header, expands to a modifiable lvalue of type
<b>int</b>. It is unspecified whether <i>errno</i> is a macro or an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro
definition is suppressed in order to access an actual object, or a program defines an identifier with the name <i>errno</i>, the
behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The value of <i>errno</i> should only be examined when it is indicated to be valid by a function's return value. No function in
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 shall set <i>errno</i> to zero. For each thread of a process, the value of
<i>errno</i> shall not be affected by function calls or assignments to <i>errno</i> by other threads.</p>

<p>Some functions return an error number directly as the function value. These functions return a value of zero to indicate
success.</p>

<p>If more than one error occurs in processing a function call, any one of the possible errors may be returned, as the order of
detection is undefined.</p>

<p>Implementations may support additional errors not included in this list, may generate errors included in this list under
circumstances other than those described here, or may contain extensions or limitations that prevent some errors from occurring.
The ERRORS section on each reference page specifies whether an error shall be returned, or whether it may be returned.
Implementations shall not generate a different error number from the ones described here for error conditions described in this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but may generate additional errors unless explicitly disallowed for a particular
function.</p>

<p>Each implementation shall document, in the conformance document, situations in which each of the optional conditions defined in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is detected. The conformance document may also contain statements that one or more of the optional
error conditions are not detected.</p>

<p>For functions under the Threads option for which [EINTR] is not listed as a possible error condition in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, an implementation shall not return an error code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>The following symbolic names identify the possible error numbers, in the context of the functions specifically defined in this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; these general descriptions are more precisely defined in the ERRORS sections of the
functions that return them. Only these symbolic names should be used in programs, since the actual value of the error number is
unspecified. All values listed in this section shall be unique integer constant expressions with type <b>int</b> suitable for use
in <b>#if</b> preprocessing directives, except as noted below. The values for all these names shall be found in the <a href=
"../basedefs/errno.h.html"><i>&lt;errno.h&gt;</i></a> header defined in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. The actual values are unspecified by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<dt>[EFAULT]</dt>

File too large. The size of a file would exceed the maximum file size of an implementation or offset maximum established in the
corresponding file description.</dd>

<dt>[EIO]</dt>

<dd>
Input/output error. Some physical input or output error has occurred. This error may be reported on a subsequent operation on the
same file descriptor. Any other error-causing operation on the same file descriptor may cause the [EIO] error indication to be

<dd>
Reserved.</dd>

<dt>[ENAMETOOLONG]</dt>

<dd>
Filename too long. The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or a pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}. This error may
also occur when pathname substitution, as a result of encountering a symbolic link during pathname resolution, results in a
pathname string the size of which exceeds {PATH_MAX}.</dd>

inappropriate.</dd>

<dt>[ENXIO]</dt>

capabilities of the device. It may also occur when, for example, a tape drive is not on-line.</dd>

<dt>[EOPNOTSUPP]</dt>

<dd>
Operation not supported on socket. The type of socket (address family or protocol) does not support the requested operation.</dd>

<dt>[EOVERFLOW]</dt>

values that can be represented in the relevant data type or that are allowed for a given data item.</dd>

Operation not permitted. An attempt was made to perform an operation limited to processes with appropriate privileges or to the
owner of a file or other resource.</dd>

<dd>
Broken pipe. A write was attempted on a socket, pipe, or FIFO for which there is no process to read the data.</dd>

"0"><br>
STREAM <a href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> timeout. The timer set for a STREAMS <a href=
"../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> call has expired. The cause of this error is device-specific and could indicate either
a hardware or software failure, or a timeout value that is too short for the specific operation. The status of the <a href=
"../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> operation is unspecified. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border=
"0"></dd>

<dt>[ETIMEDOUT]</dt>

<dd>
Connection timed out. The connection to a remote machine has timed out. If the connection timed out during execution of the
function that reported this error (as opposed to timing out prior to the function being called), it is unspecified whether the
function has completed some or all of the documented behavior associated with a successful completion of the function. 

<p>or:</p>

<p>Operation timed out. The time limit associated with the operation was exceeded before the operation completed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>[ETXTBSY]</dt>

<dd>
Text file busy. An attempt was made to execute a pure-procedure program that is currently open for writing, or an attempt has been
made to open for writing a pure-procedure program that is being executed.</dd>

<dt>[EWOULDBLOCK]</dt>

<dd>
Operation would block. An operation on a socket marked as non-blocking has encountered a situation such as no data available that
otherwise would have caused the function to suspend execution. 

<p>A conforming implementation may assign the same values for [EWOULDBLOCK] and [EAGAIN].</p>
</dd>

<dt>[EXDEV]</dt>

<dd>
Improper link. A link to a file on another file system was attempted.</dd>
