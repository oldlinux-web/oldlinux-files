<blockquote>
<div class="box"><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('CX')">CX</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]"
border="0"> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO&nbsp;C standard. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></div>

<p>The <i>fscanf</i>() function shall read from the named input <i>stream</i>. The <i>scanf</i>() function shall read from the
standard input stream <i>stdin</i>. The <i>sscanf</i>() function shall read from the string <i>s</i>. Each function reads bytes,
interprets them according to a format, and stores the results in its arguments. Each expects, as arguments, a control string
<i>format</i> described below, and a set of <i>pointer</i> arguments indicating where the converted input should be stored. The
result is undefined if there are insufficient arguments for the format. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the
excess arguments shall be evaluated but otherwise ignored.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
Conversions can be applied to the <i>n</i>th argument after the <i>format</i> in the argument list, rather than to the next unused
argument. In this case, the conversion specifier character <tt>%</tt> (see below) is replaced by the sequence
<tt>"%</tt><i>n</i><tt>$"</tt>, where <i>n</i> is a decimal integer in the range [1,{NL_ARGMAX}]. This feature provides for the
definition of format strings that select arguments in an order appropriate to specific languages. In format strings containing the
<tt>"%</tt><i>n</i><tt>$"</tt> form of conversion specifications, it is unspecified whether numbered arguments in the argument list
can be referenced from the format string more than once.</p>

<p>The <i>format</i> can contain either form of a conversion specification-that is, <tt>%</tt> or
<tt>"%</tt><i>n</i><tt>$"</tt>-but the two forms cannot be mixed within a single <i>format</i> string. The only exception to this
is that <tt>%%</tt> or <tt>%*</tt> can be mixed with the <tt>"%</tt><i>n</i><tt>$"</tt> form. When numbered argument specifications
are used, specifying the <i>N</i>th argument requires that all the leading arguments, from the first to the ( <i>N</i>-1)th, are
pointers. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('CX')">CX</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> The
<i>fscanf</i>() function in all its forms shall allow detection of a language-dependent radix character in the input string. The
radix character is defined in the program's locale (category <i>LC_NUMERIC ).</i> In the POSIX locale, or in a locale where the
radix character is not defined, the radix character shall default to a period ( <tt>'.'</tt> ). <img src="../images/opt-end.gif"
alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>The format is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any, composed of zero or more directives.
Each directive is composed of one of the following: one or more white-space characters ( &lt;space&gt;s, &lt;tab&gt;s,
&lt;newline&gt;s, &lt;vertical-tab&gt;s, or &lt;form-feed&gt;s); an ordinary character (neither <tt>'%'</tt> nor a white-space
character); or a conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character <tt>'%'</tt> <sup>[<a href=
"javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;or the
character sequence <tt>"%</tt><i>n</i><tt>$"</tt>, <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"> &nbsp;after
which the following appear in sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An optional assignment-suppressing character <tt>'*'</tt> .</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An optional non-zero decimal integer that specifies the maximum field width.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>An option length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A <i>conversion specifier</i> character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The valid conversion specifiers are
described below.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>fscanf</i>() functions shall execute each directive of the format in turn. If a directive fails, as detailed below, the
function shall return. Failures are described as input failures (due to the unavailability of input bytes) or matching failures
(due to inappropriate input).</p>

<p>A directive composed of one or more white-space characters shall be executed by reading input until no more valid input can be
read, or up to the first byte which is not a white-space character, which remains unread.</p>

<p>A directive that is an ordinary character shall be executed as follows: the next byte shall be read from the input and compared
with the byte that comprises the directive; if the comparison shows that they are not equivalent, the directive shall fail, and the
differing and subsequent bytes shall remain unread. Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a
character from being read, the directive shall fail.</p>

<p>A directive that is a conversion specification defines a set of matching input sequences, as described below for each conversion
character. A conversion specification shall be executed in the following steps.</p>

<p>Input white-space characters (as specified by <a href="isspace.html"><i>isspace</i>()</a> ) shall be skipped, unless the
conversion specification includes a <tt>[</tt> , <tt>c</tt> , <tt>C</tt> , or <tt>n</tt> conversion specifier.</p>

<p>An item shall be read from the input, unless the conversion specification includes an <tt>n</tt> conversion specifier. An input
item shall be defined as the longest sequence of input bytes (up to any specified maximum field width, which may be measured in
characters or bytes dependent on the conversion specifier) which is an initial subsequence of a matching sequence. The first byte,
if any, after the input item shall remain unread. If the length of the input item is 0, the execution of the conversion
specification shall fail; this condition is a matching failure, unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevented
input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.</p>

<p>Except in the case of a <tt>%</tt> conversion specifier, the input item (or, in the case of a <tt>%n</tt> conversion
specification, the count of input bytes) shall be converted to a type appropriate to the conversion character. If the input item is
not a matching sequence, the execution of the conversion specification fails; this condition is a matching failure. Unless
assignment suppression was indicated by a <tt>'*'</tt> , the result of the conversion shall be placed in the object pointed to by
the first argument following the <i>format</i> argument that has not already received a conversion result if the conversion
specification is introduced by <tt>%</tt> , <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;or in the <i>n</i>th argument if introduced by the character
sequence <tt>"%</tt><i>n</i><tt>$"</tt>. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"> If this object does not
have an appropriate type, or if the result of the conversion cannot be represented in the space provided, the behavior is
undefined.</p>

<dt><tt>d</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of <a href=

the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>int</b>.</dd>

<dd>Matches an optionally signed octal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of <a href=
"../functions/strtoul.html"><i>strtoul</i>()</a> with the value 8 for the <i>base</i> argument. In the absence of a size modifier,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.</dd>

<dt><tt>u</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches an optionally signed decimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of <a href=
"../functions/strtoul.html"><i>strtoul</i>()</a> with the value 10 for the <i>base</i> argument. In the absence of a size modifier,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.</dd>

<dt><tt>x</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence of <a href=
"../functions/strtoul.html"><i>strtoul</i>()</a> with the value 16 for the <i>base</i> argument. In the absence of a size modifier,
the application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>unsigned</b>.</dd>

<dt><tt>a</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>e</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>f</tt>,&nbsp;<tt>g</tt></dt>

<dd><br>
Matches an optionally signed floating-point number, infinity, or NaN, whose format is the same as expected for the subject sequence
of <a href="../functions/strtod.html"><i>strtod</i>()</a>. In the absence of a size modifier, the application shall ensure that the
corresponding argument is a pointer to <b>float</b>. 

<p>If the <a href="../functions/fprintf.html"><i>fprintf</i>()</a> family of functions generates character string representations
for infinity and NaN (a symbolic entity encoded in floating-point format) to support IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;754-1985, the
<i>fscanf</i>() family of functions shall recognize them as input.</p>
</dd>

<dt><tt>s</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches a sequence of bytes that are not white-space characters. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument
is a pointer to the initial byte of an array of <b>char</b>, <b>signed char</b>, or <b>unsigned char</b> large enough to accept the
sequence and a terminating null character code, which shall be added automatically. 

<p>If an <tt>l</tt> (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each
character shall be converted to a wide character as if by a call to the <a href="../functions/mbrtowc.html"><i>mbrtowc</i>()</a>
function, with the conversion state described by an <b>mbstate_t</b> object initialized to zero before the first character is
converted. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to an array of <b>wchar_t</b> large enough to
accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which shall be added automatically.</p>
</dd>

<dt><tt>[</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches a non-empty sequence of bytes from a set of expected bytes (the <i>scanset</i>). The normal skip over white-space
characters shall be suppressed in this case. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the
initial byte of an array of <b>char</b>, <b>signed char</b>, or <b>unsigned char</b> large enough to accept the sequence and a
terminating null byte, which shall be added automatically. 

<p>If an <tt>l</tt> (ell) qualifier is present, the input is a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state. Each
character in the sequence shall be converted to a wide character as if by a call to the <a href=
"../functions/mbrtowc.html"><i>mbrtowc</i>()</a> function, with the conversion state described by an <b>mbstate_t</b> object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a
pointer to an array of <b>wchar_t</b> large enough to accept the sequence and the terminating null wide character, which shall be
added automatically.</p>

<p>The conversion specification includes all subsequent bytes in the <i>format</i> string up to and including the matching right
square bracket ( <tt>']'</tt> ). The bytes between the square brackets (the <i>scanlist</i>) comprise the scanset, unless the byte
after the left square bracket is a circumflex ( <tt>'^'</tt> ), in which case the scanset contains all bytes that do not appear in
the scanlist between the circumflex and the right square bracket. If the conversion specification begins with <tt>"[]"</tt> or
<tt>"[^]"</tt> , the right square bracket is included in the scanlist and the next right square bracket is the matching right
square bracket that ends the conversion specification; otherwise, the first right square bracket is the one that ends the
conversion specification. If a <tt>'-'</tt> is in the scanlist and is not the first character, nor the second where the first
character is a <tt>'^'</tt> , nor the last character, the behavior is implementation-defined.</p>
</dd>

<dt><tt>c</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches a sequence of bytes of the number specified by the field width (1 if no field width is present in the conversion
specification). The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the initial byte of an array of
<b>char</b>, <b>signed char</b>, or <b>unsigned char</b> large enough to accept the sequence. No null byte is added. The normal
skip over white-space characters shall be suppressed in this case. 

<p>If an <tt>l</tt> (ell) qualifier is present, the input shall be a sequence of characters that begins in the initial shift state.
Each character in the sequence is converted to a wide character as if by a call to the <a href=
"../functions/mbrtowc.html"><i>mbrtowc</i>()</a> function, with the conversion state described by an <b>mbstate_t</b> object
initialized to zero before the first character is converted. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a
pointer to an array of <b>wchar_t</b> large enough to accept the resulting sequence of wide characters. No null wide character is
added.</p>
</dd>

<dt><tt>p</tt></dt>

<dd>Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which shall be the same as the set of sequences that is produced by the
<tt>%p</tt> conversion specification of the corresponding <a href="../functions/fprintf.html"><i>fprintf</i>()</a> functions. The
application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to a pointer to <b>void</b>. The interpretation of the input
item is implementation-defined. If the input item is a value converted earlier during the same program execution, the pointer that
results shall compare equal to that value; otherwise, the behavior of the <tt>%p</tt> conversion specification is undefined.</dd>

<dt><tt>n</tt></dt>

<dd>No input is consumed. The application shall ensure that the corresponding argument is a pointer to the integer into which shall
be written the number of bytes read from the input so far by this call to the <i>fscanf</i>() functions. Execution of a <tt>%n</tt>
conversion specification shall not increment the assignment count returned at the completion of execution of the function. No
argument shall be converted, but one shall be consumed. If the conversion specification includes an assignment-suppressing
character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.</dd>

<p>If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>The conversion specifiers <tt>A</tt> , <tt>E</tt> , <tt>F</tt> , <tt>G</tt> , and <tt>X</tt> are also valid and shall be
equivalent to <tt>a</tt> , <tt>e</tt> , <tt>f</tt> , <tt>g</tt> , and <tt>x</tt> , respectively.</p>

<p>If end-of-file is encountered during input, conversion shall be terminated. If end-of-file occurs before any bytes matching the
current conversion specification (except for <tt>%n</tt> ) have been read (other than leading white-space characters, where
permitted), execution of the current conversion specification shall terminate with an input failure. Otherwise, unless execution of
the current conversion specification is terminated with a matching failure, execution of the following conversion specification (if
any) shall be terminated with an input failure.</p>

<p>Reaching the end of the string in <i>sscanf</i>() shall be equivalent to encountering end-of-file for <i>fscanf</i>().</p>

<p>If conversion terminates on a conflicting input, the offending input is left unread in the input. Any trailing white space
(including &lt;newline&gt;s) shall be left unread unless matched by a conversion specification. The success of literal matches and
suppressed assignments is only directly determinable via the <tt>%n</tt> conversion specification.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_03_190_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This function is aligned with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard, and in doing so a few &quot;obvious&quot; things were not included.
Specifically, the set of characters allowed in a scanset is limited to single-byte characters. In other similar places, multi-byte
characters have been permitted, but for alignment with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard, it has not been done here. Applications
needing this could use the corresponding wide-character functions to achieve the desired results.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_03_190_11"></a>CHANGE HISTORY</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_190_12"></a>Issue 5</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Aligned with ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1990/Amendment 1:1995 (E). Specifically, the <tt>l</tt> (ell) qualifier is now defined for the
<tt>c</tt> , <tt>s</tt> , and <tt>[</tt> conversion specifiers.</p>

<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to indicate that if infinity and NaN can be generated by the <a href=
"../functions/fprintf.html"><i>fprintf</i>()</a> family of functions, then they are recognized by the <i>fscanf</i>() family.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_190_13"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The Open Group Corrigenda U021/7 and U028/10 are applied. These correct several occurrences of &quot;characters&quot; in the text which
have been replaced with the term &quot;bytes&quot;.</p>

<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to avoid use of the term &quot;must&quot; for application requirements.</p>

<p>The following changes are made for alignment with the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The prototypes for <i>fscanf</i>(), <i>scanf</i>(), and <i>sscanf</i>() are updated.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <tt>hh</tt> , <tt>ll</tt> , <tt>j</tt> , <tt>t</tt> , and <tt>z</tt> length modifiers are added.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <tt>a</tt> , <tt>A</tt> , and <tt>F</tt> conversion characters are added.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated to use the terms &quot;conversion specifier&quot; and &quot;conversion specification&quot; consistently.</p>
