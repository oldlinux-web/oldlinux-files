This section describes extensions to support tracing of user applications. This functionality is dependent on support of the Trace
option (and the rest of this section is not further marked for this option). <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]"

</div>

<p>The tracing facilities defined in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 allow a process to select a set of trace event types, to
activate a trace stream of the selected trace events as they occur in the flow of execution, and to retrieve the recorded trace
events.</p>

<p>The tracing operation relies on three logically different components: the traced process, the controller process, and the
analyzer process. During the execution of the traced process, when a trace point is reached, a trace event is recorded into the
trace streams created for that process in which the associated trace event type identifier is not being filtered out. The
controller process controls the operation of recording the trace events into the trace stream. It shall be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Initialize the attributes of a trace stream</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create the trace stream (for a specified traced process) using those attributes</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Start and stop tracing for the trace stream</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Filter the type of trace events to be recorded, if the Trace Event Filter option is supported</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Shut a trace stream down</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These operations can be done for an active trace stream. The analyzer process retrieves the traced events either at runtime,
when the trace stream has not yet been shut down, but is still recording trace events; or after opening a trace log that had been
previously recorded and shut down. These three logically different operations can be performed by the same process, or can be
distributed into different processes.</p>

<p>A trace stream identifier can be created by a call to <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_create.html"><i>posix_trace_create</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_create_withlog.html"><i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_open.html"><i>posix_trace_open</i>()</a>. The <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_create.html"><i>posix_trace_create</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_create_withlog.html"><i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>()</a> functions should be used by a controller
process. The <a href="../functions/posix_trace_open.html"><i>posix_trace_open</i>()</a> should be used by an analyzer process.</p>

<p>The tracing functions can serve different purposes. One purpose is debugging the possibly pre-instrumented code, while another
is post-mortem fault analysis. These two potential uses differ in that the first requires pre-filtering capabilities to avoid
overwhelming the trace stream and permits focusing on expected information; while the second needs comprehensive trace capabilities
in order to be able to record all types of information.</p>

<p>The events to be traced belong to two classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>User trace events (generated by the application instrumentation)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>System trace events (generated by the operating system)</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The trace interface defines several system trace event types associated with control of and operation of the trace stream. This
small set of system trace events includes the minimum required to interpret correctly the trace event information present in the
stream. Other desirable system trace events for some particular application profile may be implemented and are encouraged; for
example, process and thread scheduling, signal occurrence, and so on.</p>

<p>Each traced process shall have a mapping of the trace event names to trace event type identifiers that have been defined for
that process. Each active trace stream shall have a mapping that incorporates all the trace event type identifiers predefined by
the trace system plus all the mappings of trace event names to trace event type identifiers of the processes that are being traced
into that trace stream. These mappings are defined from the instrumented application by calling the <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_eventid_open.html"><i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>()</a> function and from the controller process by
calling the <a href="../functions/posix_trace_trid_eventid_open.html"><i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>()</a> function. For a
pre-recorded trace stream, the list of trace event types is obtained from the pre-recorded trace log.</p>

<p>The <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> fields of a file associated with an active trace stream shall be marked for update every
time any of the tracing operations modifies that file.</p>

<p>The <i>st_atime</i> field of a file associated with a trace stream shall be marked for update every time any of the tracing
operations causes data to be read from that file.</p>

<p>Results are undefined if the application performs any operation on a file descriptor associated with an active or pre-recorded
trace stream until <a href="../functions/posix_trace_shutdown.html"><i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>()</a> or <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_close.html"><i>posix_trace_close</i>()</a> is called for that trace stream.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this option is to define a complete set of functions and concepts that allow a conforming application to be
traced from creation to termination, whatever its realtime constraints and properties.</p>

<p>The <i>clock-resolution</i> attribute defines the clock resolution of the clock used to generate timestamps.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <i>stream-min-size</i> attribute defines the minimum size in bytes of the trace stream strictly reserved for the trace
events.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <i>stream-full-policy</i> attribute defines the policy followed when the trace stream is full; its value is
POSIX_TRACE_LOOP, POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL, or POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH.</p>

</li>

<li>
<p>The <i>log-full-policy</i> attribute defines the policy of a trace log associated with an active trace stream to be
POSIX_TRACE_LOOP, POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL, or POSIX_TRACE_APPEND.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="tag_02_11_02"></a>Trace Event Type Definitions</h4>

<h5><a name="tag_02_11_02_01"></a>System Trace Event Type Definitions</h5>

<p>The following system trace event types, defined in the <a href="../basedefs/trace.h.html"><i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i></a> header,
track the invocation of the trace operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>POSIX_TRACE_START shall be associated with a trace start operation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>POSIX_TRACE_STOP shall be associated with a trace stop operation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Trace Event Filter option is supported, POSIX_TRACE_FILTER shall be associated with a trace event type filter change
operation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following system trace event types, defined in the <a href="../basedefs/trace.h.html"><i>&lt;trace.h&gt;</i></a> header,
report operational trace events:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>POSIX_TRACE_OVERFLOW shall mark the beginning of a trace overflow condition.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>POSIX_TRACE_RESUME shall mark the end of a trace overflow condition.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Trace Log option is supported, POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH_START shall mark the beginning of a flush operation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Trace Log option is supported, POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH_STOP shall mark the end of a flush operation.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If an implementation-defined trace error condition is reported, it shall be marked POSIX_TRACE_ERROR.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The interpretation of a trace stream or a trace log by a trace analyzer process relies on the information recorded for each
trace event, and also on system trace events that indicate the invocation of trace control operations and trace system operational
trace events.</p>

<p>The POSIX_TRACE_START and POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace events specify the time windows during which the trace stream is running.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event with an associated data that is equal to zero indicates a call of the function <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_stop.html"><i>posix_trace_stop</i>()</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event with an associated data that is different from zero indicates an automatic stop of the trace
stream (see <a href="posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy.html"><i>posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy</i>()</a> ).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The POSIX_TRACE_FILTER trace event indicates that a trace event type filter value changed while the trace stream was
running.</p>

<p>The POSIX_TRACE_ERROR serves to inform the analyzer process that an implementation-defined internal error of the trace system
occurred.</p>

<p>The POSIX_TRACE_OVERFLOW trace event shall be reported with a timestamp equal to the timestamp of the first trace event
overwritten. This is an indication that some generated trace events have been lost.</p>

<p>The POSIX_TRACE_RESUME trace event shall be reported with a timestamp equal to the timestamp of the first valid trace event
reported after the overflow condition ends and shall be reported before this first valid trace event. This is an indication that
the trace system is reliably recording trace events after an overflow condition.</p>

<p>Each of these trace event types shall be defined by a constant trace event name and a <b>trace_event_id_t</b> constant; trace
event data is associated with some of these trace events.</p>

<p>If the Trace option is supported and the Trace Event Filter option and the Trace Log option are not supported, the following
predefined system trace events in <a href="#tagtcjh_3">Trace Option: System Trace Events</a> shall be defined:<br>

<h4><a name="tag_02_11_03"></a>Trace Functions</h4>

<p>The trace interface is built and structured to improve portability through use of trace data of opaque type. The object-oriented
approach for the manipulation of trace attributes and trace event type identifiers requires definition of many constructor and
selector functions which operate on these opaque types. Also, the trace interface must support several different tracing roles. To
facilitate reading the trace interface, the trace functions are grouped into small functional sets supporting the three different
roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A trace controller process requires functions to set up and customize all the resources needed to run a trace stream,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Attribute initialization and destruction ( <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_attr_init.html"><i>posix_trace_attr_init</i>()</a>)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Identification information manipulation ( <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_attr_getgenversion.html"><i>posix_trace_attr_getgenversion</i>()</a>)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Trace system behavior modification ( <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_attr_getinherited.html"><i>posix_trace_attr_getinherited</i>()</a>)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Trace stream and trace log size set ( <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_attr_getmaxusereventsize.html"><i>posix_trace_attr_getmaxusereventsize</i>()</a>)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Trace stream creation, flush, and shutdown ( <a href="../functions/posix_trace_create.html"><i>posix_trace_create</i>()</a>)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Trace stream and trace log clear ( <a href="../functions/posix_trace_clear.html"><i>posix_trace_clear</i>()</a>)</p>

<li>
<p>Trace event type identifier manipulation ( <a href=
