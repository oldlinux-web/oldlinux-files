<h3><a name="tag_02_06"></a>STREAMS</h3>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSR')">XSR</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
STREAMS functionality is provided on implementations supporting the XSI STREAMS Option Group. This functionality is dependent on
support of the XSI STREAMS option (and the rest of this section is not further marked for this option). <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>STREAMS provides a uniform mechanism for implementing networking services and other character-based I/O. The STREAMS function
provides direct access to protocol modules. STREAMS modules are unspecified objects. Access to STREAMS modules is provided by
interfaces in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Creation of STREAMS modules is outside the scope of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>A STREAM is typically a full-duplex connection between a process and an open device or pseudo-device. However, since pipes may
be STREAMS-based, a STREAM can be a full-duplex connection between two processes. The STREAM itself exists entirely within the
implementation and provides a general character I/O function for processes. It optionally includes one or more intermediate
processing modules that are interposed between the process end of the STREAM (STREAM head) and a device driver at the end of the
STREAM (STREAM end).</p>

<p>STREAMS I/O is based on messages. There are three types of message:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Data messages</i> containing actual data for input or output</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><i>Control data</i> containing instructions for the STREAMS modules and underlying implementation</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Other messages, which include file descriptors</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The interface between the STREAM and the rest of the implementation is provided by a set of functions at the STREAM head. When a
process calls <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/writev.html"><i>writev</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/putmsg.html"><i>putmsg</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/putpmsg.html"><i>putpmsg</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a>, messages are sent down the STREAM, and <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/readv.html"><i>readv</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getmsg.html"><i>getmsg</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/getpmsg.html"><i>getpmsg</i>()</a> accepts data from the
STREAM and passes it to a process. Data intended for the device at the downstream end of the STREAM is packaged into messages and
sent downstream, while data and signals from the device are composed into messages by the device driver and sent upstream to the
STREAM head.</p>

<p>When a STREAMS-based device is opened, a STREAM shall be created that contains the STREAM head and the STREAM end (driver). If
pipes are STREAMS-based in an implementation, when a pipe is created, two STREAMS shall be created, each containing a STREAM head.
Other modules are added to the STREAM using <a href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a>. New modules are &quot;pushed&quot; onto
the STREAM one at a time in last-in, first-out (LIFO) style, as though the STREAM was a push-down stack.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_02_06_00_01"></a>Priority</h5>

<p>Message types are classified according to their queuing priority and may be <i>normal</i> (non-priority), <i>priority</i>, or
<i>high-priority</i> messages. A message belongs to a particular priority band that determines its ordering when placed on a queue.
Normal messages have a priority band of 0 and shall always be placed at the end of the queue following all other messages in the
queue. High-priority messages are always placed at the head of a queue, but shall be discarded if there is already a high-priority
message in the queue. Their priority band shall be ignored; they are high-priority by virtue of their type. Priority messages have
a priority band greater than 0. Priority messages are always placed after any messages of the same or higher priority.
High-priority and priority messages are used to send control and data information outside the normal flow of control. By
convention, high-priority messages shall not be affected by flow control. Normal and priority messages have separate flow
controls.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_02_06_00_02"></a>Message Parts</h5>

<p>A process may access STREAMS messages that contain a data part, control part, or both. The data part is that information which
is transmitted over the communication medium and the control information is used by the local STREAMS modules. The other types of
messages are used between modules and are not accessible to processes. Messages containing only a data part are accessible via <a
href="../functions/putmsg.html"><i>putmsg</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/putpmsg.html"><i>putpmsg</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getmsg.html"><i>getmsg</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getpmsg.html"><i>getpmsg</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/readv.html"><i>readv</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/writev.html"><i>writev</i>()</a>. Messages containing a
control part with or without a data part are accessible via calls to <a href="../functions/putmsg.html"><i>putmsg</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/putpmsg.html"><i>putpmsg</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getmsg.html"><i>getmsg</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/getpmsg.html"><i>getpmsg</i>()</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_02_06_01"></a>Accessing STREAMS</h4>

<p>A process accesses STREAMS-based files using the standard functions <a href="../functions/close.html"><i>close</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getmsg.html"><i>getmsg</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/getpmsg.html"><i>getpmsg</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/pipe.html"><i>pipe</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/poll.html"><i>poll</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/putmsg.html"><i>putmsg</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/putpmsg.html"><i>putpmsg</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>. Refer to the applicable
function definitions for general properties and errors.</p>

<p>Calls to <a href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> shall perform control functions on the STREAM associated with the
file descriptor <i>fildes</i>. The control functions may be performed by the STREAM head, a STREAMS module, or the STREAMS driver
for the STREAM.</p>

<p>STREAMS modules and drivers can detect errors, sending an error message to the STREAM head, thus causing subsequent functions to
fail and set <i>errno</i> to the value specified in the message. In addition, STREAMS modules and drivers can elect to fail a
particular <a href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> request alone by sending a negative acknowledgement message to the
STREAM head. This shall cause just the pending <a href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> request to fail and set
<i>errno</i> to the value specified in the message.</p>
