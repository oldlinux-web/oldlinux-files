<h4><a name="tag_03_594_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>read</i>() function shall attempt to read <i>nbyte</i> bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor,
<i>fildes</i>, into the buffer pointed to by <i>buf</i>. The behavior of multiple concurrent reads on the same pipe, FIFO, or
terminal device is unspecified.</p>

<p>Before any action described below is taken, and if <i>nbyte</i> is zero, the <i>read</i>() function may detect and return errors
as described below. In the absence of errors, or if error detection is not performed, the <i>read</i>() function shall return zero
and have no other results.</p>

<p>On files that support seeking (for example, a regular file), the <i>read</i>() shall start at a position in the file given by
the file offset associated with <i>fildes</i>. The file offset shall be incremented by the number of bytes actually read.</p>

<p>Files that do not support seeking-for example, terminals-always read from the current position. The value of a file offset
associated with such a file is undefined.</p>

<p>No data transfer shall occur past the current end-of-file. If the starting position is at or after the end-of-file, 0 shall be
returned. If the file refers to a device special file, the result of subsequent <i>read</i>() requests is
implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If the value of <i>nbyte</i> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>When attempting to read from an empty pipe or FIFO:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If no process has the pipe open for writing, <i>read</i>() shall return 0 to indicate end-of-file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is set, <i>read</i>() shall return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to
[EAGAIN].</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If some process has the pipe open for writing and O_NONBLOCK is clear, <i>read</i>() shall block the calling thread until some
data is written or the pipe is closed by all processes that had the pipe open for writing.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When attempting to read a file (other than a pipe or FIFO) that supports non-blocking reads and has no data currently
available:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is set, <i>read</i>() shall return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to [EAGAIN].</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If O_NONBLOCK is clear, <i>read</i>() shall block the calling thread until some data becomes available.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The use of the O_NONBLOCK flag has no effect if there is some data available.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>read</i>() function reads data previously written to a file. If any portion of a regular file prior to the end-of-file
has not been written, <i>read</i>() shall return bytes with value 0. For example, <a href=
"../functions/lseek.html"><i>lseek</i>()</a> allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of existing data in the file. If data
is later written at this point, subsequent reads in the gap between the previous end of data and the newly written data shall
return bytes with value 0 until data is written into the gap.</p>

<p>Upon successful completion, where <i>nbyte</i> is greater than 0, <i>read</i>() shall mark for update the <i>st_atime</i> field
of the file, and shall return the number of bytes read. This number shall never be greater than <i>nbyte</i>. The value returned
may be less than <i>nbyte</i> if the number of bytes left in the file is less than <i>nbyte</i>, if the <i>read</i>() request was
interrupted by a signal, or if the file is a pipe or FIFO or special file and has fewer than <i>nbyte</i> bytes immediately
available for reading. For example, a <i>read</i>() from a file associated with a terminal may return one typed line of data.</p>

<p>If a <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal before it reads any data, it shall return -1 with <i>errno</i> set to [EINTR].</p>

<p>If a <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read some data, it shall return the number of bytes
read.</p>

<p>For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset maximum established in the open file description associated with
<i>fildes</i>.</p>

<p>If <i>fildes</i> refers to a socket, <i>read</i>() shall be equivalent to <a href="../functions/recv.html"><i>recv</i>()</a>
with no flags set.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSR')">XSR</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> A
<i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file can read data in three different modes: <i>byte-stream</i> mode, <i>message-nondiscard</i> mode,
and <i>message-discard</i> mode. The default shall be byte-stream mode. This can be changed using the I_SRDOPT <a href=
"../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> request, and can be tested with I_GRDOPT <a href=
"../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a>. In byte-stream mode, <i>read</i>() shall retrieve data from the STREAM until as many
bytes as were requested are transferred, or until there is no more data to be retrieved. Byte-stream mode ignores message
boundaries.</p>

<p>In STREAMS message-nondiscard mode, <i>read</i>() shall retrieve data until as many bytes as were requested are transferred, or
until a message boundary is reached. If <i>read</i>() does not retrieve all the data in a message, the remaining data shall be left
on the STREAM, and can be retrieved by the next <i>read</i>() call. Message-discard mode also retrieves data until as many bytes as
were requested are transferred, or a message boundary is reached. However, unread data remaining in a message after the
<i>read</i>() returns shall be discarded, and shall not be available for a subsequent <i>read</i>(), <a href=
"../functions/getmsg.html"><i>getmsg</i>()</a>, or <a href="../functions/getpmsg.html"><i>getpmsg</i>()</a> call.</p>

<p>How <i>read</i>() handles zero-byte STREAMS messages is determined by the current read mode setting. In byte-stream mode,
<i>read</i>() shall accept data until it has read <i>nbyte</i> bytes, or until there is no more data to read, or until a zero-byte
message block is encountered. The <i>read</i>() function shall then return the number of bytes read, and place the zero-byte
message back on the STREAM to be retrieved by the next <i>read</i>(), <a href="../functions/getmsg.html"><i>getmsg</i>()</a>, or <a
href="../functions/getpmsg.html"><i>getpmsg</i>()</a>. In message-nondiscard mode or message-discard mode, a zero-byte message
shall return 0 and the message shall be removed from the STREAM. When a zero-byte message is read as the first message on a STREAM,
the message shall be removed from the STREAM and 0 shall be returned, regardless of the read mode.</p>

<p>A <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file shall return the data in the message at the front of the STREAM head read queue, regardless
of the priority band of the message.</p>

<p>By default, STREAMs are in control-normal mode, in which a <i>read</i>() from a STREAMS file can only process messages that
contain a data part but do not contain a control part. The <i>read</i>() shall fail if a message containing a control part is
encountered at the STREAM head. This default action can be changed by placing the STREAM in either control-data mode or
control-discard mode with the I_SRDOPT <a href="../functions/ioctl.html"><i>ioctl</i>()</a> command. In control-data mode,
<i>read</i>() shall convert any control part to data and pass it to the application before passing any data part originally present
in the same message. In control-discard mode, <i>read</i>() shall discard message control parts but return to the process any data
part in the message.</p>

<p>In addition, <i>read</i>() shall fail if the STREAM head had processed an asynchronous error before the call. In this case, the
value of <i>errno</i> shall not reflect the result of <i>read</i>(), but reflect the prior error. If a hangup occurs on the STREAM
being read, <i>read</i>() shall continue to operate normally until the STREAM head read queue is empty. Thereafter, it shall return
0. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
The <i>pread</i>() function shall be equivalent to <i>read</i>(), except that it shall read from a given position in the file
without changing the file pointer. The first three arguments to <i>pread</i>() are the same as <i>read</i>() with the addition of a
fourth argument <i>offset</i> for the desired position inside the file. An attempt to perform a <i>pread</i>() on a file that is
incapable of seeking shall result in an error. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h4><a name="tag_03_594_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_594_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify the value of the file offset after an error is returned; there
are too many cases. For programming errors, such as [EBADF], the concept is meaningless since no file is involved. For errors that
are detected immediately, such as [EAGAIN], clearly the pointer should not change. After an interrupt or hardware error, however,
an updated value would be very useful and is the behavior of many implementations.</p>

<p>Note that a <i>read</i>() of zero bytes does not modify <i>st_atime</i>. A <i>read</i>() that requests more than zero bytes, but
returns zero, shall modify <i>st_atime</i>.</p>

<p>Implementations are allowed, but not required, to perform error checking for <i>read</i>() requests of zero bytes.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_03_594_08_01"></a>Input and Output</h5>

<p>The use of I/O with large byte counts has always presented problems. Ideas such as <i>lread</i>() and <i>lwrite</i>() (using and
returning <b>long</b>s) were considered at one time. The current solution is to use abstract types on the ISO&nbsp;C standard
function to <i>read</i>() and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>. The abstract types can be declared so that
existing functions work, but can also be declared so that larger types can be represented in future implementations. It is presumed
that whatever constraints limit the maximum range of <b>size_t</b> also limit portable I/O requests to the same range. This volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 also limits the range further by requiring that the byte count be limited so that a signed return
value remains meaningful. Since the return type is also a (signed) abstract type, the byte count can be defined by the
implementation to be larger than an <b>int</b> can hold.</p>

<p>The standard developers considered adding atomicity requirements to a pipe or FIFO, but recognized that due to the nature of
pipes and FIFOs there could be no guarantee of atomicity of reads of {PIPE_BUF} or any other size that would be an aid to
applications portability.</p>

<p>This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that no action be taken for <i>read</i>() or <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> when <i>nbyte</i> is zero. This is not intended to take precedence over detection of
errors (such as invalid buffer pointers or file descriptors). This is consistent with the rest of this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, but the phrasing here could be misread to require detection of the zero case before any other
errors. A value of zero is to be considered a correct value, for which the semantics are a no-op.</p>

<p>I/O is intended to be atomic to ordinary files and pipes and FIFOs. Atomic means that all the bytes from a single operation that
started out together end up together, without interleaving from other I/O operations. It is a known attribute of terminals that
this is not honored, and terminals are explicitly (and implicitly permanently) excepted, making the behavior unspecified. The
behavior for other device types is also left unspecified, but the wording is intended to imply that future standards might choose
to specify atomicity (or not).</p>

<p>There were recommendations to add format parameters to <i>read</i>() and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> in
order to handle networked transfers among heterogeneous file system and base hardware types. Such a facility may be required for
support by the OSI presentation of layer services. However, it was determined that this should correspond with similar C-language
facilities, and that is beyond the scope of this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. The concept was suggested to the
developers of the ISO&nbsp;C standard for their consideration as a possible area for future work.</p>

<p>In 4.3 BSD, a <i>read</i>() or <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> that is interrupted by a signal before
transferring any data does not by default return an [EINTR] error, but is restarted. In 4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and the Eighth Edition,
there is an additional function, <a href="../functions/select.html"><i>select</i>()</a>, whose purpose is to pause until specified
activity (data to read, space to write, and so on) is detected on specified file descriptors. It is common in applications written
for those systems for <a href="../functions/select.html"><i>select</i>()</a> to be used before <i>read</i>() in situations (such as
keyboard input) where interruption of I/O due to a signal is desired.</p>

<p>The issue of which files or file types are interruptible is considered an implementation design issue. This is often affected
primarily by hardware and reliability issues.</p>

<p>There are no references to actions taken following an &quot;unrecoverable error&quot;. It is considered beyond the scope of this volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to describe what happens in the case of hardware errors.</p>

<p>Previous versions of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 allowed two very different behaviors with regard to the handling of
interrupts. In order to minimize the resulting confusion, it was decided that IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 should support only
one of these behaviors. Historical practice on AT&amp;T-derived systems was to have <i>read</i>() and <a href=
"../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to [EINTR] when interrupted after some, but not all, of
the data requested had been transferred. However, the U.S. Department of Commerce FIPS 151-1 and FIPS 151-2 require the historical
BSD behavior, in which <i>read</i>() and <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> return the number of bytes actually
transferred before the interrupt. If -1 is returned when any data is transferred, it is difficult to recover from the error on a
seekable device and impossible on a non-seekable device. Most new implementations support this behavior. The behavior required by
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is to return the number of bytes transferred.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify when an implementation that buffers <i>read</i>()ss actually moves the data into
the user-supplied buffer, so an implementation may chose to do this at the latest possible moment. Therefore, an interrupt arriving
earlier may not cause <i>read</i>() to return a partial byte count, but rather to return -1 and set <i>errno</i> to [EINTR].</p>

<p>Consideration was also given to combining the two previous options, and setting <i>errno</i> to [EINTR] while returning a short
count. However, not only is there no existing practice that implements this, it is also contradictory to the idea that when
<i>errno</i> is set, the function responsible shall return -1.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_03_594_13"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The DESCRIPTION and ERRORS sections are updated so that references to STREAMS are marked as part of the XSI STREAMS Option
Group.</p>

<p>The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The DESCRIPTION now states that if <i>read</i>() is interrupted by a signal after it has successfully read some data, it returns
the number of bytes read. In Issue 3, it was optional whether <i>read</i>() returned the number of bytes read, or whether it
returned -1 with <i>errno</i> set to [EINTR]. This is a FIPS requirement.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In the DESCRIPTION, text is added to indicate that for regular files, no data transfer occurs past the offset maximum
established in the open file description associated with <i>fildes</i>. This change is to support large files.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The [EOVERFLOW] mandatory error condition is added.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The [ENXIO] optional error condition is added.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Text referring to sockets is added to the DESCRIPTION.</p>

<p>The following changes were made to align with the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.1a draft standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The effect of reading zero bytes is clarified.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1j-2000 by specifying that <i>read</i>() results are
unspecified for typed memory objects.</p>

<p>New RATIONALE is added to explain the atomicity requirements for input and output operations.</p>

<p>The following error conditions are added for operations on sockets: [EAGAIN], [ECONNRESET], [ENOTCONN], and [ETIMEDOUT].</p>

<p>The [EIO] error is changed to &quot;may fail&quot;.</p>

<p>The following error conditions are added for operations on sockets: [ENOBUFS] and [ENOMEM].</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/readv.html"><i>readv</i>()</a> function is split out into a separate reference page.</p>
