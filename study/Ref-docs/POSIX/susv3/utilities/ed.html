<blockquote>
<p>The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_42_12"></a>OUTPUT FILES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent on the editing commands given.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_42_13"></a>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>ed</i> utility shall operate on a copy of the file it is editing; changes made to the copy shall have no effect on the
file until a <b>w</b> (write) command is given. The copy of the text is called the <i>buffer</i>.</p>

<p>Commands to <i>ed</i> have a simple and regular structure: zero, one, or two <i>addresses</i> followed by a single-character
<i>command</i>, possibly followed by parameters to that command. These addresses specify one or more lines in the buffer. Every
command that requires addresses has default addresses, so that the addresses very often can be omitted. If the <b>-p</b> option is
specified, the prompt string shall be written to standard output before each command is read.</p>

<p>In general, only one command can appear on a line. Certain commands allow text to be input. This text is placed in the
appropriate place in the buffer. While <i>ed</i> is accepting text, it is said to be in <i>input mode</i>. In this mode, no
commands shall be recognized; all input is merely collected. Input mode is terminated by entering a line consisting of two
characters: a period ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) followed by a &lt;newline&gt;. This line is not considered part of the input text.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_42_13_01"></a>Regular Expressions in ed</h5>

<p>The <i>ed</i> utility shall support basic regular expressions, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap09.html#tag_09_03">Section 9.3, Basic Regular Expressions</a>. Since
regular expressions in <i>ed</i> are always matched against single lines (excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;s), never
against any larger section of text, there is no way for a regular expression to match a &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>A null RE shall be equivalent to the last RE encountered.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are used in addresses to specify lines, and in some commands (for example, the <b>s</b> substitute command)
to specify portions of a line to be substituted.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_42_13_02"></a>Addresses in ed</h5>

<p>Addressing in <i>ed</i> relates to the current line. Generally, the current line is the last line affected by a command. The
current line number is the address of the current line. If the edit buffer is not empty, the initial value for the current line
shall be the last line in the edit buffer; otherwise, zero.</p>

<p>Addresses shall be constructed as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The period character ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) shall address the current line.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The dollar sign character ( <tt>'$'</tt> ) shall address the last line of the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The positive decimal number <i>n</i> shall address the <i>n</i>th line of the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The apostrophe-x character pair ( <tt>"'x"</tt> ) shall address the line marked with the mark name character <i>x</i>, which
shall be a lowercase letter from the portable character set. It shall be an error if the character has not been set to mark a line
or if the line that was marked is not currently present in the edit buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A BRE enclosed by slash characters ( <tt>'/'</tt> ) shall address the first line found by searching forwards from the line
following the current line toward the end of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line for which the line excluding the
terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a pair of slash characters shall address
the next line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE encountered. In addition, the
second slash can be omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a backslash-slash pair ( <tt>"\/"</tt> ) shall represent
a literal slash instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary, the search shall wrap around to the beginning of the buffer and
continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer is searched.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A BRE enclosed by question-mark characters ( <tt>'?'</tt> ) shall address the first line found by searching backwards from the
line preceding the current line toward the beginning of the edit buffer and stopping at the first line for which the line excluding
the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the BRE. The BRE consisting of a null BRE delimited by a pair of question-mark characters (
<tt>"??"</tt> ) shall address the previous line for which the line excluding the terminating &lt;newline&gt; matches the last BRE
encountered. In addition, the second question-mark can be omitted at the end of a command line. Within the BRE, a
backslash-question-mark pair ( <tt>"\?"</tt> ) shall represent a literal question mark instead of the BRE delimiter. If necessary,
the search shall wrap around to the end of the buffer and continue up to and including the current line, so that the entire buffer
is searched.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A plus-sign ( <tt>'+'</tt> ) or hyphen character ( <tt>'-'</tt> ) followed by a decimal number shall address the current line
plus or minus the number. A plus-sign or hyphen character not followed by a decimal number shall address the current line plus or
minus 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Addresses can be followed by zero or more address offsets, optionally &lt;blank&gt;-separated. Address offsets are constructed
as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A plus-sign or hyphen character followed by a decimal number shall add or subtract, respectively, the indicated number of lines
to or from the address. A plus-sign or hyphen character not followed by a decimal number shall add or subtract 1 to or from the
address.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A decimal number shall add the indicated number of lines to the address.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It shall not be an error for an intermediate address value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit
buffer. It shall be an error for the final address value to be less than zero or greater than the last line in the edit buffer. It
shall be an error if a search for a BRE fails to find a matching line.</p>

<p>Commands accept zero, one, or two addresses. If more than the required number of addresses are provided to a command that
requires zero addresses, it shall be an error. Otherwise, if more than the required number of addresses are provided to a command,
the addresses specified first shall be evaluated and then discarded until the maximum number of valid addresses remain, for the
specified command.</p>

<p>Addresses shall be separated from each other by a comma ( <tt>','</tt> ) or semicolon character ( <tt>';'</tt> ). In the case of
a semicolon separator, the current line ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) shall be set to the first address, and only then will the second address
be calculated. This feature can be used to determine the starting line for forwards and backwards searches; see rules 5. and 6.</p>

<p>Addresses can be omitted on either side of the comma or semicolon separator, in which case the resulting address pairs shall be
as follows:</p>

<p>Any &lt;blank&gt;s included between addresses, address separators, or address offsets shall be ignored.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_42_13_03"></a>Commands in ed</h5>

<p>In the following list of <i>ed</i> commands, the default addresses are shown in parentheses. The number of addresses shown in
the default shall be the number expected by the command. The parentheses are not part of the address; they show that the given
addresses are the default.</p>

<p>It is generally invalid for more than one command to appear on a line. However, any command (except <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>,
<b>f</b>, <b>q</b>, <b>Q</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>w</b>, and <b>!</b>) can be suffixed by the letter <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>; in
which case, except for the <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, and <b>p</b> commands, the command shall be executed and then the new current line
shall be written as described below under the <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, and <b>p</b> commands. When an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>
suffix is used with an <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b> command, the command shall write to standard output as described below, but
it is unspecified whether the suffix writes the current line again in the requested format or whether the suffix has no effect. For
example, the <b>pl</b> command (base <b>p</b> command with an <b>l</b> suffix) shall either write just the current line or write it
twice-once as specified for <b>p</b> and once as specified for <b>l</b>. Also, the <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>V</b>
commands shall take a command as a parameter.</p>

<p>Each address component can be preceded by zero or more &lt;blank&gt;s. The command letter can be preceded by zero or more
&lt;blank&gt;s. If a suffix letter ( <b>l</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>p</b>) is given, the application shall ensure that it immediately
follows the command.</p>

<p>The <b>e</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>r</b>, and <b>w</b> commands shall take an optional <i>file</i> parameter, separated from
the command letter by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>If changes have been made in the buffer since the last <b>w</b> command that wrote the entire buffer, <i>ed</i> shall warn the
user if an attempt is made to destroy the editor buffer via the <b>e</b> or <b>q</b> commands. The <i>ed</i> utility shall write
the string:</p>

<pre>
<tt>"?\n"
</tt>
</pre>

<p>(followed by an explanatory message if <i>help mode</i> has been enabled via the <b>H</b> command) to standard output and shall
continue in command mode with the current line number unchanged. If the <b>e</b> or <b>q</b> command is repeated with no
intervening command, it shall take effect.</p>

<p>If a terminal disconnect is detected:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the buffer is not empty and has changed since the last write, the <i>ed</i> utility shall attempt to write a copy of the
buffer to a file named <b>ed.hup</b> in the current directory. If this write fails, <i>ed</i> shall attempt to write a copy of the
buffer to a filename <b>ed.hup</b> in the directory named by the <i>HOME</i> environment variable. If both these attempts fail,
<i>ed</i> shall exit without saving the buffer.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <i>ed</i> utility shall not write the file to the currently remembered pathname or return to command mode, and shall
terminate with a non-zero exit status.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If an end-of-file is detected on standard input:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the <i>ed</i> utility is in input mode, <i>ed</i> shall terminate input mode and return to command mode. It is unspecified if
any partially entered lines (that is, input text without a terminating &lt;newline&gt;) are discarded from the input text.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the <i>ed</i> utility is in command mode, it shall act as if a <b>q</b> command had been entered.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the closing delimiter of an RE or of a replacement string (for example, <tt>'/'</tt> ) in a <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>s</b>,
<b>v</b>, or <b>V</b> command would be the last character before a &lt;newline&gt;, that delimiter can be omitted, in which case
the addressed line shall be written. For example, the following pairs of commands are equivalent:</p>

<pre>
<tt>s/s1/s2   s/s1/s2/p
g/s1      g/s1/p
?s1       ?s1?
</tt>
</pre>

<p>If an invalid command is entered, <i>ed</i> shall write the string:</p>

<pre>
<tt>"?\n"
</tt>
</pre>

<p>(followed by an explanatory message if <i>help mode</i> has been enabled via the <b>H</b> command) to standard output and shall
continue in command mode with the current line number unchanged.</p>

The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line of the buffer. If no pathname is given, the currently
remembered pathname, if any, shall be used (see the <b>f</b> command). The number of bytes read shall be written to standard

whose output is to be read. Such a shell command line shall not be remembered as the current <i>file</i>. All marks shall be
discarded upon the completion of a successful <b>e</b> command. If the buffer has changed since the last time the entire buffer was

shall be executed for each marked line, with the current line number set to the address of that line. Any line modified by the
<i>command list</i> shall be unmarked. When the <b>g</b> command completes, the current line number shall have the value assigned
by the last command in the <i>command list</i>. If there were no matching lines, the current line number shall not be changed. A
single command or the first of a list of commands shall appear on the same line as the global command. All lines of a multi-line
list except the last line shall be ended with a backslash preceding the terminating &lt;newline&gt;; the <b>a</b>, <b>i</b>, and
<b>c</b> commands and associated input are permitted. The <tt>'.'</tt> terminating input mode can be omitted if it would be the
last line of the <i>command list</i>. An empty <i>command list</i> shall be equivalent to the <b>p</b> command. The use of the

other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a slash to delimit the RE. Within the RE, the RE delimiter
itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash.</p>

that line, and any one command (other than one of the <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>i</b>, <b>g</b>, <b>G</b>, <b>v</b>, and <b>V</b>
commands) shall be read and executed. A &lt;newline&gt; shall act as a null command (causing no action to be taken on the current
line); an <tt>'&amp;'</tt> shall cause the re-execution of the most recent non-null command executed within the current invocation
of <b>G</b>. Note that the commands input as part of the execution of the <b>G</b> command can address and affect any lines in the
buffer. The final value of the current line number shall be the value set by the last command successfully executed. (Note that the
last command successfully executed shall be the <b>G</b> command itself if a command fails or the null command is specified.) If
there were no matching lines, the current line number shall not be changed. The <b>G</b> command can be terminated by a SIGINT
signal. Any character other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of a slash to delimit the RE and the
replacement. Within the RE, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by a backslash.</p>

The currently remembered pathname shall not be changed unless there is no remembered pathname. Address 0 shall be valid for

<pre>
<tt>(.,.)s/</tt><i>RE</i><tt>/</tt><i>replacement</i><tt>/</tt><i>flags</i>
</pre>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <b>s</b> command shall search each addressed line for an occurrence of the specified RE and replace either the first or all
(non-overlapped) matched strings with the <i>replacement</i>; see the following description of the <b>g</b> suffix. It is an error
if the substitution fails on every addressed line. Any character other than &lt;space&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; can be used instead of
a slash to delimit the RE and the replacement. Within the RE, the RE delimiter itself can be used as a literal character if it is
preceded by a backslash. The current line shall be set to the address of the last line on which a substitution occurred.</p>

<p>An ampersand ( <tt>'&amp;'</tt> ) appearing in the <i>replacement</i> shall be replaced by the string matching the RE on the
current line. The special meaning of <tt>'&amp;'</tt> in this context can be suppressed by preceding it by backslash. As a more
general feature, the characters <tt>'\n'</tt> , where <i>n</i> is a digit, shall be replaced by the text matched by the
corresponding back-reference expression. When the character <tt>'%'</tt> is the only character in the <i>replacement</i>, the
<i>replacement</i> used in the most recent substitute command shall be used as the <i>replacement</i> in the current substitute
command; if there was no previous substitute command, the use of <tt>'%'</tt> in this manner shall be an error. The <tt>'%'</tt>
shall lose its special meaning when it is in a replacement string of more than one character or is preceded by a backslash. For
each backslash ( <tt>'\'</tt> ) encountered in scanning <i>replacement</i> from beginning to end, the following character shall
lose its special meaning (if any). It is unspecified what special meaning is given to any character other than <tt>'&amp;'</tt> ,
<tt>'\'</tt> , <tt>'%'</tt> , or digits.</p>

<p>A line can be split by substituting a &lt;newline&gt; into it. The application shall ensure it escapes the &lt;newline&gt; in
the <i>replacement</i> by preceding it by backslash. Such substitution cannot be done as part of a <b>g</b> or <b>v</b> <i>command
list</i>. The current line number shall be set to the address of the last line on which a substitution is performed. If no
substitution is performed, the current line number shall be unchanged. If a line is split, a substitution shall be considered to
have been performed on each of the new lines for the purpose of determining the new current line number. A substitution shall be
considered to have been performed even if the replacement string is identical to the string that it replaces.</p>

<p>The application shall ensure that the value of <i>flags</i> is zero or more of:</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_42_16"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<p>Because of the extremely terse nature of the default error messages, the prudent script writer begins the <i>ed</i> input

<p>In previous versions, an obsolescent <b>-</b> option was described. This is no longer specified. Applications should use the
<b>-s</b> option. Using <b>-</b> as a <i>file</i> operand now produces unspecified results. This allows implementations to continue
to support the former required behavior.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_42_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The initial description of this utility was adapted from the SVID. It contains some features not found in Version 7 or
BSD-derived systems. Some of the differences between the POSIX and BSD <i>ed</i> utilities include, but need not be limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The BSD <b>-</b> option does not suppress the <tt>'!'</tt> prompt after a <b>!</b> command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not support the special meanings of the <tt>'%'</tt> and <tt>'!'</tt> characters within a <b>!</b> command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not support the <i>addresses</i> <tt>';'</tt> and <tt>','</tt> .</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD allows the command/suffix pairs <b>pp</b>, <b>ll</b>, and so on, which are unspecified in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not support the <tt>'!'</tt> character part of the <b>e</b>, <b>r</b>, or <b>w</b> commands.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A failed <b>g</b> command in BSD sets the line number to the last line searched if there are no matches.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not default the <i>command list</i> to the <b>p</b> command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not support the <b>G</b>, <b>h</b>, <b>H</b>, <b>n</b>, or <b>V</b> commands.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On BSD, if there is no inserted text, the insert command changes the current line to the referenced line -1; that is, the line
before the specified line.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On BSD, the <a href="../utilities/join.html"><i>join</i></a> command with only a single address changes the current line to that
address.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not support the <b>P</b> command; moreover, in BSD it is synonymous with the <b>p</b> command.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>BSD does not support the <i>undo</i> of the commands <b>j</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>r</b>, <b>s</b>, or <b>t</b>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The Version 7 <i>ed</i> command <b>W</b>, and the BSD <i>ed</i> commands <b>W</b>, <b>wq</b>, and <b>z</b> are not present in
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>-s</b> option was added to allow the functionality of the now withdrawn <b>-</b> option in a manner compatible with the
Utility Syntax Guidelines.</p>

<p>In early proposals there was a limit, {ED_FILE_MAX}, that described the historical limitations of some <i>ed</i> utilities in
their handling of large files; some of these have had problems with files larger than 100000 bytes. It was this limitation that
prompted much of the desire to include a <a href="../utilities/split.html"><i>split</i></a> command in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Since this limit was removed, this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that
implementations document the file size limits imposed by <i>ed</i> in the conformance document. The limit {ED_LINE_MAX} was also
removed; therefore, the global limit {LINE_MAX} is used for input and output lines.</p>

<p>The manner in which the <b>l</b> command writes non-printable characters was changed to avoid the historical
backspace-overstrike method. On video display terminals, the overstrike is ambiguous because most terminals simply replace
overstruck characters, making the <b>l</b> format not useful for its intended purpose of unambiguously understanding the content of
the line. The historical backslash escapes were also ambiguous. (The string <tt>"a\0011"</tt> could represent a line containing
those six characters or a line containing the three characters <tt>'a'</tt> , a byte with a binary value of 1, and a 1.) In the
format required here, a backslash appearing in the line is written as <tt>"\\"</tt> so that the output is truly unambiguous. The
method of marking the ends of lines was adopted from the <a href="../utilities/ex.html"><i>ex</i></a> editor and is required for
any line ending in &lt;space&gt;s; the <tt>'$'</tt> is placed on all lines so that a real <tt>'$'</tt> at the end of a line cannot
be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>Systems with bytes too large to fit into three octal digits must devise other means of displaying non-printable characters.
Consideration was given to requiring that the number of octal digits be large enough to hold a byte, but this seemed to be too
confusing for applications on the vast majority of systems where three digits are adequate. It would be theoretically possible for
the application to use the <a href="../utilities/getconf.html"><i>getconf</i></a> utility to find out the CHAR_BIT value and deal
with such an algorithm; however, there is really no portable way that an application can use the octal values of the bytes across
various coded character sets, so the additional specification was not worthwhile.</p>

<p>The description of how a NUL is written was removed. The NUL character cannot be in text files, and this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 should not dictate behavior in the case of undefined, erroneous input.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the other editing utilities, the filenames accepted by the <b>E</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>r</b> commands
are not patterns.</p>

<p>Early proposals stated that the <b>-p</b> option worked only when standard input was associated with a terminal device. This has
been changed to conform to historical implementations, thereby allowing applications to interpose themselves between a user and the
<i>ed</i> utility.</p>

<p>The form of the substitute command that uses the <b>n</b> suffix was limited in some historical documentation (where this was
described incorrectly as &quot;backreferencing&quot;). This limit has been omitted because there is no reason why an editor processing
lines of {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The command <b>s/x/X/2047</b> should be able to substitute the 2047th
occurrence of <tt>'x'</tt> on a line.</p>

<p>The use of printing commands with printing suffixes (such as <b>pn</b>, <b>lp</b>, and so on) was made unspecified because
BSD-based systems allow this, whereas System V does not.</p>

<p>Some BSD-based systems exit immediately upon receipt of end-of-file if all of the lines in the file have been deleted. Since
this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 refers to the <b>q</b> command in this instance, such behavior is not allowed.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations returned exit status zero even if command errors had occurred; this is not allowed by this
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Some historical implementations contained a bug that allowed a single period to be entered in input mode as &lt;backslash&gt;
&lt;period&gt; &lt;newline&gt;. This is not allowed by <i>ed</i> because there is no description of escaping any of the characters
in input mode; backslashes are entered into the buffer exactly as typed. The typical method of entering a single period has been to
precede it with another character and then use the substitute command to delete that character.</p>

<p>It is difficult under some modes of some versions of historical operating system terminal drivers to distinguish between an
end-of-file condition and terminal disconnect. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not require implementations to distinguish
between the two situations, which permits historical implementations of the <i>ed</i> utility on historical platforms to conform.
Implementations are encouraged to distinguish between the two, if possible, and take appropriate action on terminal disconnect.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ed</i> accepted a zero address for the <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands in order to insert text at the start of
the edit buffer. When the buffer was empty the command <b>.=</b> returned zero. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires conformance
to historical practice.</p>

<p>For consistency with the <b>a</b> and <b>r</b> commands and better user functionality, the <b>i</b> and <b>c</b> commands must
also accept an address of 0, in which case 0<i>i</i> is treated as 1<i>i</i> and likewise for the <b>c</b> command.</p>

<p>All of the following are valid addresses:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><tt>+++</tt></dt>

<dd>Three lines after the current line.</dd>

<dt><tt>-2</tt></dt>

<dd>Two lines before the current line.</dd>

<dt><tt>3&nbsp;----&nbsp;2</tt></dt>

<p>Any number of addresses can be provided to commands taking addresses; for example, <tt>"1,2,3,4,5p"</tt> prints lines 4 and 5,
because two is the greatest valid number of addresses accepted by the <b>print</b> command. This, in combination with the semicolon
delimiter, permits users to create commands based on ordered patterns in the file. For example, the command <tt>"3;/foo/;+2p"</tt>
will display the first line after line 3 that contains the pattern <i>foo</i>, plus the next two lines. Note that the address
<tt>"3;"</tt> must still be evaluated before being discarded, because the search origin for the <tt>"/foo/"</tt> command depends on
this.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ed</i> disallowed address chains, as discussed above, consisting solely of comma or semicolon separators; for
example, <tt>",,,"</tt> or <tt>";;;"</tt> were considered an error. For consistency of address specification, this restriction is
removed. The following table lists some of the address forms now possible:</p>

<p>Historically, values could be added to addresses by including them after one or more &lt;blank&gt;s; for example,
<tt>"3&nbsp;-&nbsp;5p"</tt> wrote the seventh line of the file, and <tt>"/foo/&nbsp;5"</tt> was the same as <tt>"5&nbsp;/foo/"</tt>
. However, only absolute values could be added; for example, <tt>"5&nbsp;/foo/"</tt> was an error. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001
requires conformance to historical practice.</p>

<p>Historically, <i>ed</i> accepted the <tt>'^'</tt> character as an address, in which case it was identical to the hyphen
character. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not require or prohibit this behavior.</p>

<p>The Open Group Corrigendum U025/2 is applied, correcting the description of the Edit section.</p>

<p>The <i>ed</i> utility is updated to align with the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.2b draft standard. This includes addition of the treatment of
the SIGQUIT signal, changes to <i>ed</i> addressing, and changes to processing when end-of-file is detected and when terminal
disconnect is detected.</p>

<p>The normative text is reworded to avoid use of the term &quot;must&quot; for application requirements.</p>
