<h4><a name="tag_04_91_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall create a new shell execution environment with a new real and effective group identification. Of
the attributes listed in <a href="xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_12"><i>Shell Execution Environment</i></a> , the new shell execution
environment shall retain the working directory, file creation mask, and exported variables from the previous environment (that is,
open files, traps, unexported variables, alias definitions, shell functions, and <a href=
"../utilities/set.html"><i>set</i></a> options may be lost). All other aspects of the process environment that are
preserved by the <i>exec</i> family of functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 shall
also be preserved by <i>newgrp</i>; whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.</p>

<p>A failure to assign the new group identifications (for example, for security or password-related reasons) shall not prevent the
new shell execution environment from being created.</p>

<p>The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall affect the supplemental groups for the process as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>On systems where the effective group ID is normally in the supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective group ID
actually is in the supplementary group list):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the new effective group ID is also in the supplementary group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall change the effective group ID.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the new effective group ID is not in the supplementary group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall add the new effective group ID to the
list, if there is room to add it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>On systems where the effective group ID is not normally in the supplementary group list (or whenever the old effective group ID
is not in the supplementary group list):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary group list, <i>newgrp</i> shall delete it.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary list, <i>newgrp</i> shall add it if there is room.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<basefont size="2"> 

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>The System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not specify whether the effective group ID of a process is
included in its supplementary group list.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<p>With no operands, <i>newgrp</i> shall change the effective group back to the groups identified in the user's user entry, and
shall set the list of supplementary groups to that set in the user's group database entries.</p>

<p>If a password is required for the specified group, and the user is not listed as a member of that group in the group database,
the user shall be prompted to enter the correct password for that group. If the user is listed as a member of that group, no
password shall be requested. If no password is required for the specified group, it is implementation-defined whether users not
listed as members of that group can change to that group. Whether or not a password is required, implementation-defined system
accounting or security mechanisms may impose additional authorization restrictions that may cause <i>newgrp</i> to write a
diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group identification.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_91_04"></a>OPTIONS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>newgrp</i> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href=
"../basedefs/xbd_chap12.html#tag_12_02">Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines</a>.</p>

error.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>The invoking shell may terminate.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<div class="box"><em>The following sections are informative.</em></div>

<h4><a name="tag_04_91_16"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no convenient way to enter a password into the group database. Use of group passwords is not encouraged, because by
their very nature they encourage poor security practices. Group passwords may disappear in the future.</p>

<p>A common implementation of <i>newgrp</i> is that the current shell uses <i>exec</i> to overlay itself with <i>newgrp</i>, which
in turn overlays itself with a new shell after changing group. On some implementations, however, this may not occur and
<i>newgrp</i> may be invoked as a subprocess.</p>

<p>The <i>newgrp</i> command is intended only for use from an interactive terminal. It does not offer a useful interface for the
support of applications.</p>

<p>The exit status of <i>newgrp</i> is generally inapplicable. If <i>newgrp</i> is used in a script, in most cases it successfully
invokes a new shell and the rest of the original shell script is bypassed when the new shell exits. Used interactively,
<i>newgrp</i> displays diagnostic messages to indicate problems. But usage such as:</p>

<pre>
<tt>newgrp foo
echo $?
</tt>
</pre>

<p>is not useful because the new shell might not have access to any status <i>newgrp</i> may have generated (and most historical
systems do not provide this status). A zero status echoed here does not necessarily indicate that the user has changed to the new
group successfully. Following <i>newgrp</i> with the <a href="../utilities/id.html"><i>id</i></a> command provides a portable means
of determining whether the group change was successful or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_91_17"></a>EXAMPLES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_91_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Most historical implementations use one of the <i>exec</i> functions to implement the behavior of <i>newgrp</i>. Errors detected
before the <i>exec</i> leave the environment unchanged, while errors detected after the <i>exec</i> leave the user in a changed
environment. While it would be useful to have <i>newgrp</i> issue a diagnostic message to tell the user that the environment
changed, it would be inappropriate to require this change to some historical implementations.</p>

<p>The password mechanism is allowed in the group database, but how this would be implemented is not specified.</p>

<p>The <i>newgrp</i> utility was retained in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, even given the existence of the
multiple group permissions feature in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, for several reasons. First,
in some implementations, the group ownership of a newly created file is determined by the group of the directory in which the file
is created, as allowed by the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; on other implementations, the group
ownership of a newly created file is determined by the effective group ID. On implementations of the latter type, <i>newgrp</i>
allows files to be created with a specific group ownership. Finally, many implementations use the real group ID in accounting, and
on such systems, <i>newgrp</i> allows the accounting identity of the user to be changed.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_91_21"></a>CHANGE HISTORY</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 2.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_91_22"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>This utility is marked as part of the User Portability Utilities option.</p>

<p>The obsolescent SYNOPSIS is removed.</p>

<p>The text describing supplemental groups is no longer conditional on {NGROUPS_MAX} being greater than 1. This is because
{NGROUPS_MAX} now has a minimum value of 8. This is a FIPS requirement.</p>
