<h3><a name="tag_01_03"></a>Definitions</h3>

<p>The definitions in this section are stated so that they can be used as exact substitutes for the terms in text. They should not
contain requirements or cross-references to sections within IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; that is accomplished by using an
informative note. In addition, the term should not be included in its own definition. Where requirements or descriptions need to be
addressed but cannot be included in the definitions, due to not meeting the above criteria, these occur in the General Concepts
chapter.</p>

<p>In this revision, the definitions have been reworked extensively to meet style requirements and to include terms from the base
documents (see the Scope).</p>

<p>Many of these definitions are necessarily circular, and some of the terms (such as &quot;process&quot;) are variants of basic computing
science terms that are inherently hard to define. Where some definitions are more conceptual and contain requirements, these appear
in the General Concepts chapter. Those listed in this section appear in an alphabetical glossary format of terms.</p>

<p>Some definitions must allow extension to cover terms or facilities that are not explicitly mentioned in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. For example, the definition of &quot;Extended Security Controls&quot; permits implementations beyond those
defined in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Some terms in the following list of notes do not appear in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001; these are marked prefixed with an
asterisk (*). Many of them have been specifically excluded from IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because they concern system
administration, implementation, or other issues that are not specific to the programming interface. Those are marked with a reason,
such as &quot;implementation-defined&quot;.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_01"></a>Appropriate Privileges</h5>

<p>One of the fundamental security problems with many historical UNIX systems has been that the privilege mechanism is monolithic-a
user has either no privileges or <i>all</i> privileges. Thus, a successful &quot;trojan horse&quot; attack on a privileged process defeats
all security provisions. Therefore, POSIX.1 allows more granular privilege mechanisms to be defined. For many historical
implementations of the UNIX system, the presence of the term &quot;appropriate privileges&quot; in POSIX.1 may be understood as a synonym
for &quot;superuser&quot; (UID 0). However, other systems have emerged where this is not the case and each discrete controllable action has
<i>appropriate privileges</i> associated with it. Because this mechanism is implementation-defined, it must be described in the
conformance document. Although that description affects several parts of POSIX.1 where the term &quot;appropriate privilege&quot; is used,
because the term &quot;implementation-defined&quot; only appears here, the description of the entire mechanism and its effects on these
other sections belongs in this equivalent section of the conformance document. This is especially convenient for implementations
with a single mechanism that applies in all areas, since it only needs to be described once.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_02"></a>Byte</h5>

<p>The restriction that a byte is now exactly eight bits was a conscious decision by the standard developers. It came about due to
a combination of factors, primarily the use of the type <b>int8_t</b> within the networking functions and the alignment with the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard, where the <b>intN_t</b> types are now defined.</p>

<p>According to the ISO/IEC&nbsp;9899:1999 standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <b>[u]intN_t</b> types must be two's complement with no padding bits and no illegal values.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All types (apart from bit fields, which are not relevant here) must occupy an integral number of bytes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If a type with width <i>W</i> occupies <i>B</i> bytes with <i>C</i> bits per byte ( <i>C</i> is the value of {CHAR_BIT}), then
it has <i>P</i> padding bits where <i>P</i>+ <i>W</i>= <i>B</i>* <i>C</i>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Therefore, for <b>int8_t</b> <i>P</i>=0, <i>W</i>=8. Since <i>B</i>&gt;=1, <i>C</i>&gt;=8, the only solution is <i>B</i>=1,
<i>C</i>=8.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The standard developers also felt that this was not an undue restriction for the current state-of-the-art for this version of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1, but recognize that if industry trends continue, a wider character type may be required in the
future.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_03"></a>Character</h5>

<p>The term &quot;character&quot; is used to mean a sequence of one or more bytes representing a single graphic symbol. The deviation in
the exact text of the ISO&nbsp;C standard definition for &quot;byte&quot; meets the intent of the rationale of the ISO&nbsp;C standard also
clears up the ambiguity raised by the term &quot;basic execution character set&quot;. The octet-minimum requirement is a reflection of the
{CHAR_BIT} value.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_04"></a>Clock Tick</h5>

<p>The ISO&nbsp;C standard defines a similar interval for use by the <a href="../functions/clock.html"><i>clock</i>()</a> function.
There is no requirement that these intervals be the same. In historical implementations these intervals are different.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_05"></a>Command</h5>

<p>The terms &quot;command&quot; and &quot;utility&quot; are related but have distinct meanings. Command is defined as &quot;a directive to a shell to
perform a specific task&quot;. The directive can be in the form of a single utility name (for example, <a href=
"../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a>), or the directive can take the form of a compound command (for example, <tt>"ls | grep name |
pr"</tt> ). A utility is a program that can be called by name from a shell. Issuing only the name of the utility to a shell is the
equivalent of a one-word command. A utility may be invoked as a separate program that executes in a different process than the
command language interpreter, or it may be implemented as a part of the command language interpreter. For example, the <a href=
"../utilities/echo.html"><i>echo</i></a> command (the directive to perform a specific task) may be implemented such that the <a
href="../utilities/echo.html"><i>echo</i></a> utility (the logic that performs the task of echoing) is in a separate program;
therefore, it is executed in a process that is different from the command language interpreter. Conversely, the logic that performs
the <a href="../utilities/echo.html"><i>echo</i></a> utility could be built into the command language interpreter; therefore, it
could execute in the same process as the command language interpreter.</p>

<p>The terms &quot;tool&quot; and &quot;application&quot; can be thought of as being synonymous with &quot;utility&quot; from the perspective of the
operating system kernel. Tools, applications, and utilities historically have run, typically, in processes above the kernel level.
Tools and utilities historically have been a part of the operating system non-kernel code and have performed system-related
functions, such as listing directory contents, checking file systems, repairing file systems, or extracting system status
information. Applications have not generally been a part of the operating system, and they perform non-system-related functions,
such as word processing, architectural design, mechanical design, workstation publishing, or financial analysis. Utilities have
most frequently been provided by the operating system distributor, applications by third-party software distributors, or by the
users themselves. Nevertheless, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not differentiate between tools, utilities, and applications
when it comes to receiving services from the system, a shell, or the standard utilities. (For example, the <a href=
"../utilities/xargs.html"><i>xargs</i></a> utility invokes another utility; it would be of fairly limited usefulness if the users
could not run their own applications in place of the standard utilities.) Utilities are not applications in the sense that they are
not themselves subject to the restrictions of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 or any other standard-there is no requirement for <a
href="../utilities/grep.html"><i>grep</i></a>, <a href="../utilities/stty.html"><i>stty</i></a>, or any of the utilities defined
here to be any of the classes of conforming applications.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_06"></a>Column Positions</h5>

<p>In most 1-byte character sets, such as ASCII, the concept of column positions is identical to character positions and to bytes.
Therefore, it has been historically acceptable for some implementations to describe line folding or tab stops or table column
alignment in terms of bytes or character positions. Other character sets pose complications, as they can have internal
representations longer than one octet and they can have display characters that have different widths on the terminal screen or
printer.</p>

<p>In IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 the term &quot;column positions&quot; has been defined to mean character-not byte-positions in input
files (such as &quot;column position 7 of the FORTRAN input&quot;). Output files describe the column position in terms of the display width
of the narrowest printable character in the character set, adjusted to fit the characteristics of the output device. It is very
possible that <i>n</i> column positions will not be able to hold <i>n</i> characters in some character sets, unless all of those
characters are of the narrowest width. It is assumed that the implementation is aware of the width of the various characters,
deriving this information from the value of <i>LC_CTYPE ,</i> and thus can determine how many column positions to allot for each
character in those utilities where it is important.</p>

<p>The term &quot;column position&quot; was used instead of the more natural &quot;column&quot; because the latter is frequently used in the
different contexts of columns of figures, columns of table values, and so on. Wherever confusion might result, these latter types
of columns are referred to as &quot;text columns&quot;.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_07"></a>Controlling Terminal</h5>

<p>The question of which of possibly several special files referring to the terminal is meant is not addressed in POSIX.1. The
filename <b>/dev/tty</b> is a synonym for the controlling terminal associated with a process.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_08"></a>Device Number*</h5>

<p>The concept is handled in <a href="../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a> as <i>ID of device</i>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_09"></a>Direct I/O</h5>

<p>Historically, direct I/O refers to the system bypassing intermediate buffering, but may be extended to cover
implementation-defined optimizations.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_10"></a>Directory</h5>

<p>The format of the directory file is implementation-defined and differs radically between System&nbsp;V and 4.3 BSD. However,
routines (derived from 4.3 BSD) for accessing directories and certain constraints on the format of the information returned by
those routines are described in the <a href="../basedefs/dirent.h.html"><i>&lt;dirent.h&gt;</i></a> header.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_11"></a>Directory Entry</h5>

<p>Throughout IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the term &quot;link&quot; is used (about the <a href=
"../functions/link.html"><i>link</i>()</a> function, for example) in describing the objects that point to files from
directories.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_12"></a>Display</h5>

<p>The Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 assigns precise requirements for the terms &quot;display&quot; and
&quot;write&quot;. Some historical systems have chosen to implement certain utilities without using the traditional file descriptor model.
For example, the <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a> editor might employ direct screen memory updates on a personal
computer, rather than a <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> system call. An instance of user prompting might
appear in a dialog box, rather than with standard error. When the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 uses
the term &quot;display&quot;, the method of outputting to the terminal is unspecified; many historical implementations use <i>termcap</i>
or <i>terminfo</i>, but this is not a requirement. The term &quot;write&quot; is used when the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 mandates that a file descriptor be used and that the output can be redirected. However, it is
assumed that when the writing is directly to the terminal (it has not been redirected elsewhere), there is no practical way for a
user or test suite to determine whether a file descriptor is being used. Therefore, the use of a file descriptor is mandated only
for the redirection case and the implementation is free to use any method when the output is not redirected. The verb <i>write</i>
is used almost exclusively, with the very few exceptions of those utilities where output redirection need not be supported: <a
href="../utilities/tabs.html"><i>tabs</i></a>, <a href="../utilities/talk.html"><i>talk</i></a>, <a href=
"../utilities/tput.html"><i>tput</i></a>, and <a href="../utilities/vi.html"><i>vi</i></a>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_13"></a>Dot</h5>

<p>The symbolic name <i>dot</i> is carefully used in POSIX.1 to distinguish the working directory filename from a period or a
decimal point.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_14"></a>Dot-Dot</h5>

<p>Historical implementations permit the use of these filenames without their special meanings. Such use precludes any meaningful
use of these filenames by a Conforming POSIX.1 Application. Therefore, such use is considered an extension, the use of which makes
an implementation non-conforming; see also <a href="xbd_chap04.html#tag_01_04_11"><i>Pathname Resolution</i></a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_15"></a>Epoch</h5>

<p>Historically, the origin of UNIX system time was referred to as &quot;00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970&quot;. Greenwich Mean Time is
actually not a term acknowledged by the international standards community; therefore, this term, &quot;Epoch&quot;, is used to abbreviate
the reference to the actual standard, Coordinated Universal Time.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_16"></a>FIFO Special File</h5>

<p>See <a href="#tag_01_03_00_45">Pipe</a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_17"></a>File</h5>

<p>It is permissible for an implementation-defined file type to be non-readable or non-writable.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_18"></a>File Classes</h5>

<p>These classes correspond to the historical sets of permission bits. The classes are general to allow implementations flexibility
in expanding the access mechanism for more stringent security environments. Note that a process is in one and only one class, so
there is no ambiguity.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_19"></a>Filename</h5>

<p>At the present time, the primary responsibility for truncating filenames containing multi-byte characters must reside with the
application. Some industry groups involved in internationalization believe that in the future the responsibility must reside with
the kernel. For the moment, a clearer understanding of the implications of making the kernel responsible for truncation of
multi-byte filenames is needed.</p>

<p>Character-level truncation was not adopted because there is no support in POSIX.1 that advises how the kernel distinguishes
between single and multi-byte characters. Until that time, it must be incumbent upon application writers to determine where
multi-byte characters must be truncated.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_20"></a>File System</h5>

<p>Historically, the meaning of this term has been overloaded with two meanings: that of the complete file hierarchy, and that of a
mountable subset of that hierarchy; that is, a mounted file system. POSIX.1 uses the term &quot;file system&quot; in the second sense,
except that it is limited to the scope of a process (and a process' root directory). This usage also clarifies the domain in which
a file serial number is unique.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_21"></a>Graphic Character</h5>

<p>This definition is made available for those definitions (in particular, <i>TZ )</i> which must exclude control characters.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_22"></a>Group Database</h5>

<p>See <a href="#tag_01_03_00_63">User Database</a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_23"></a>Group File*</h5>

<p>Implementation-defined; see <a href="#tag_01_03_00_63">User Database</a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_24"></a>Historical Implementations*</h5>

<p>This refers to previously existing implementations of programming interfaces and operating systems that are related to the
interface specified by POSIX.1.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_25"></a>Hosted Implementation*</h5>

<p>This refers to a POSIX.1 implementation that is accomplished through interfaces from the POSIX.1 services to some alternate form
of operating system kernel services. Note that the line between a hosted implementation and a native implementation is blurred,
since most implementations will provide some services directly from the kernel and others through some indirect path. (For example,
<a href="../functions/fopen.html"><i>fopen</i>()</a> might use <a href="../functions/open.html"><i>open</i>()</a>; or <a href=
"../functions/mkfifo.html"><i>mkfifo</i>()</a> might use <a href="../functions/mknod.html"><i>mknod</i>()</a>.) There is no
necessary relationship between the type of implementation and its correctness, performance, and/or reliability.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_26"></a>Implementation*</h5>

<p>This term is generally used instead of its synonym, &quot;system&quot;, to emphasize the consequences of decisions to be made by system
implementors. Perhaps if no options or extensions to POSIX.1 were allowed, this usage would not have occurred.</p>

<p>The term &quot;specific implementation&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;implementation&quot;. This should not be interpreted too
narrowly; both terms can represent a relatively broad group of systems. For example, a hardware vendor could market a very wide
selection of systems that all used the same instruction set, with some systems desktop models and others large multi-user
minicomputers. This wide range would probably share a common POSIX.1 operating system, allowing an application compiled for one to
be used on any of the others; this is a [ <i>specific</i>] <i>implementation</i>. However, such a wide range of machines probably
has some differences between the models. Some may have different clock rates, different file systems, different resource limits,
different network connections, and so on, depending on their sizes or intended usages. Even on two identical machines, the system
administrators may configure them differently. Each of these different systems is known by the term &quot;a specific instance of a
specific implementation&quot;. This term is only used in the portions of POSIX.1 dealing with runtime queries: <a href=
"../functions/sysconf.html"><i>sysconf</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/pathconf.html"><i>pathconf</i>()</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_27"></a>Incomplete Pathname*</h5>

<p>Absolute pathname has been adequately defined.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_28"></a>Job Control</h5>

<p>In order to understand the job control facilities in POSIX.1 it is useful to understand how they are used by a job
control-cognizant shell to create the user interface effect of job control.</p>

<p>While the job control facilities supplied by POSIX.1 can, in theory, support different types of interactive job control
interfaces supplied by different types of shells, there was historically one particular interface that was most common when the
standard was originally developed (provided by BSD C&nbsp;Shell). This discussion describes that interface as a means of
illustrating how the POSIX.1 job control facilities can be used.</p>

<p>Job control allows users to selectively stop (suspend) the execution of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a
later point. The user typically employs this facility via the interactive interface jointly supplied by the terminal I/O driver and
a command interpreter (shell).</p>

<p>The user can launch jobs (command pipelines) in either the foreground or background. When launched in the foreground, the shell
waits for the job to complete before prompting for additional commands. When launched in the background, the shell does not wait,
but immediately prompts for new commands.</p>

<p>If the user launches a job in the foreground and subsequently regrets this, the user can type the suspend character (typically
set to &lt;control&gt;-Z), which causes the foreground job to stop and the shell to begin prompting for new commands. The stopped
job can be continued by the user (via special shell commands) either as a foreground job or as a background job. Background jobs
can also be moved into the foreground via shell commands.</p>

<p>If a background job attempts to access the login terminal (controlling terminal), it is stopped by the terminal driver and the
shell is notified, which, in turn, notifies the user. (Terminal access includes <a href="../functions/read.html"><i>read</i>()</a>
and certain terminal control functions, and conditionally includes <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a>.) The user
can continue the stopped job in the foreground, thus allowing the terminal access to succeed in an orderly fashion. After the
terminal access succeeds, the user can optionally move the job into the background via the suspend character and shell
commands.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Implementing Job Control Shells</i></p>

<p>The interactive interface described previously can be accomplished using the POSIX.1 job control facilities in the following
way.</p>

<p>The key feature necessary to provide job control is a way to group processes into jobs. This grouping is necessary in order to
direct signals to a single job and also to identify which job is in the foreground. (There is at most one job that is in the
foreground on any controlling terminal at a time.)</p>

<p>The concept of process groups is used to provide this grouping. The shell places each job in a separate process group via the <a
href="../functions/setpgid.html"><i>setpgid</i>()</a> function. To do this, the <a href=
"../functions/setpgid.html"><i>setpgid</i>()</a> function is invoked by the shell for each process in the job. It is actually
useful to invoke <a href="../functions/setpgid.html"><i>setpgid</i>()</a> twice for each process: once in the child process, after
calling <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> to create the process, but before calling one of the <i>exec</i> family
of functions to begin execution of the program, and once in the parent shell process, after calling <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> to create the child. The redundant invocation avoids a race condition by ensuring that
the child process is placed into the new process group before either the parent or the child relies on this being the case. The
process group ID for the job is selected by the shell to be equal to the process ID of one of the processes in the job. Some shells
choose to make one process in the job be the parent of the other processes in the job (if any). Other shells (for example, the
C&nbsp;Shell) choose to make themselves the parent of all processes in the pipeline (job). In order to support this latter case,
the <a href="../functions/setpgid.html"><i>setpgid</i>()</a> function accepts a process group ID parameter since the correct
process group ID cannot be inherited from the shell. The shell itself is considered to be a job and is the sole process in its own
process group.</p>

<p>The shell also controls which job is currently in the foreground. A foreground and background job differ in two ways: the shell
waits for a foreground command to complete (or stop) before continuing to read new commands, and the terminal I/O driver inhibits
terminal access by background jobs (causing the processes to stop). Thus, the shell must work cooperatively with the terminal I/O
driver and have a common understanding of which job is currently in the foreground. It is the user who decides which command should
be currently in the foreground, and the user informs the shell via shell commands. The shell, in turn, informs the terminal I/O
driver via the <a href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a> function. This indicates to the terminal I/O driver the
process group ID of the foreground process group (job). When the current foreground job either stops or terminates, the shell
places itself in the foreground via <a href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a> before prompting for additional
commands. Note that when a job is created the new process group begins as a background process group. It requires an explicit act
of the shell via <a href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a> to move a process group (job) into the
foreground.</p>

<p>When a process in a job stops or terminates, its parent (for example, the shell) receives synchronous notification by calling
the <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> function with the WUNTRACED flag set. Asynchronous notification is
also provided when the parent establishes a signal handler for SIGCHLD and does not specify the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag. Usually all
processes in a job stop as a unit since the terminal I/O driver always sends job control stop signals to all processes in the
process group.</p>

<p>To continue a stopped job, the shell sends the SIGCONT signal to the process group of the job. In addition, if the job is being
continued in the foreground, the shell invokes <a href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a> to place the job in the
foreground before sending SIGCONT. Otherwise, the shell leaves itself in the foreground and reads additional commands.</p>

<p>There is additional flexibility in the POSIX.1 job control facilities that allows deviations from the typical interface.
Clearing the TOSTOP terminal flag allows background jobs to perform <a href="../functions/write.html"><i>write</i>()</a> functions
without stopping. The same effect can be achieved on a per-process basis by having a process set the signal action for SIGTTOU to
SIG_IGN.</p>

<p>Note that the terms &quot;job&quot; and &quot;process group&quot; can be used interchangeably. A login session that is not using the job control
facilities can be thought of as a large collection of processes that are all in the same job (process group). Such a login session
may have a partial distinction between foreground and background processes; that is, the shell may choose to wait for some
processes before continuing to read new commands and may not wait for other processes. However, the terminal I/O driver will
consider all these processes to be in the foreground since they are all members of the same process group.</p>

<p>In addition to the basic job control operations already mentioned, a job control-cognizant shell needs to perform the following
actions.</p>

<p>When a foreground (not background) job stops, the shell must sample and remember the current terminal settings so that it can
restore them later when it continues the stopped job in the foreground (via the <a href=
"../functions/tcgetattr.html"><i>tcgetattr</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/tcsetattr.html"><i>tcsetattr</i>()</a>
functions).</p>

<p>Because a shell itself can be spawned from a shell, it must take special action to ensure that subshells interact well with
their parent shells.</p>

<p>A subshell can be spawned to perform an interactive function (prompting the terminal for commands) or a non-interactive function
(reading commands from a file). When operating non-interactively, the job control shell will refrain from performing the job
control-specific actions described above. It will behave as a shell that does not support job control. For example, all jobs will
be left in the same process group as the shell, which itself remains in the process group established for it by its parent. This
allows the shell and its children to be treated as a single job by a parent shell, and they can be affected as a unit by terminal
keyboard signals.</p>

<p>An interactive subshell can be spawned from another job control-cognizant shell in either the foreground or background. (For
example, from the C&nbsp;Shell, the user can execute the command, CONVERSION ERROR (.Cm) csh &nbsp;&amp; .) Before the subshell
activates job control by calling <a href="../functions/setpgid.html"><i>setpgid</i>()</a> to place itself in its own process group
and <a href="../functions/tcsetpgrp.html"><i>tcsetpgrp</i>()</a> to place its new process group in the foreground, it needs to
ensure that it has already been placed in the foreground by its parent. (Otherwise, there could be multiple job control shells that
simultaneously attempt to control mediation of the terminal.) To determine this, the shell retrieves its own process group via <a
href="../functions/getpgrp.html"><i>getpgrp</i>()</a> and the process group of the current foreground job via <a href=
"../functions/tcgetpgrp.html"><i>tcgetpgrp</i>()</a>. If these are not equal, the shell sends SIGTTIN to its own process group,
causing itself to stop. When continued later by its parent, the shell repeats the process group check. When the process groups
finally match, the shell is in the foreground and it can proceed to take control. After this point, the shell ignores all the job
control stop signals so that it does not inadvertently stop itself.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Implementing Job Control Applications</i></p>

<p>Most applications do not need to be aware of job control signals and operations; the intuitively correct behavior happens by
default. However, sometimes an application can inadvertently interfere with normal job control processing, or an application may
choose to overtly effect job control in cooperation with normal shell procedures.</p>

<p>An application can inadvertently subvert job control processing by &quot;blindly&quot; altering the handling of signals. A common
application error is to learn how many signals the system supports and to ignore or catch them all. Such an application makes the
assumption that it does not know what this signal is, but knows the right handling action for it. The system may initialize the
handling of job control stop signals so that they are being ignored. This allows shells that do not support job control to inherit
and propagate these settings and hence to be immune to stop signals. A job control shell will set the handling to the default
action and propagate this, allowing processes to stop. In doing so, the job control shell is taking responsibility for restarting
the stopped applications. If an application wishes to catch the stop signals itself, it should first determine their inherited
handling states. If a stop signal is being ignored, the application should continue to ignore it. This is directly analogous to the
recommended handling of SIGINT described in the referenced UNIX Programmer's Manual.</p>

<p>If an application is reading the terminal and has disabled the interpretation of special characters (by clearing the ISIG flag),
the terminal I/O driver will not send SIGTSTP when the suspend character is typed. Such an application can simulate the effect of
the suspend character by recognizing it and sending SIGTSTP to its process group as the terminal driver would have done. Note that
the signal is sent to the process group, not just to the application itself; this ensures that other processes in the job also
stop. (Note also that other processes in the job could be children, siblings, or even ancestors.) Applications should not assume
that the suspend character is &lt;control&gt;-Z (or any particular value); they should retrieve the current setting at startup.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Implementing Job Control Systems</i></p>

<p>The intent in adding 4.2 BSD-style job control functionality was to adopt the necessary 4.2 BSD programmatic interface with only
minimal changes to resolve syntactic or semantic conflicts with System&nbsp;V or to close recognized security holes. The goal was
to maximize the ease of providing both conforming implementations and Conforming POSIX.1 Applications.</p>

<p>It is only useful for a process to be affected by job control signals if it is the descendant of a job control shell. Otherwise,
there will be nothing that continues the stopped process.</p>

<p>POSIX.1 does not specify how controlling terminal access is affected by a user logging out (that is, by a controlling process
terminating). 4.2 BSD uses the <i>vhangup</i>() function to prevent any access to the controlling terminal through file descriptors
opened prior to logout. System&nbsp;V does not prevent controlling terminal access through file descriptors opened prior to logout
(except for the case of the special file, <b>/dev/tty</b>). Some implementations choose to make processes immune from job control
after logout (that is, such processes are always treated as if in the foreground); other implementations continue to enforce
foreground/background checks after logout. Therefore, a Conforming POSIX.1 Application should not attempt to access the controlling
terminal after logout since such access is unreliable. If an implementation chooses to deny access to a controlling terminal after
its controlling process exits, POSIX.1 requires a certain type of behavior (see <a href="#tag_01_03_00_07">Controlling Terminal</a>
).</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_32"></a>Map</h5>

<p>The definition of map is included to clarify the usage of mapped pages in the description of the behavior of process memory
locking.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_33"></a>Memory-Resident</h5>

<p>The term &quot;memory-resident&quot; is historically understood to mean that the so-called resident pages are actually present in the
physical memory of the computer system and are immune from swapping, paging, copy-on-write faults, and so on. This is the actual
intent of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 in the process memory locking section for implementations where this is logical. But for
some implementations-primarily mainframes-actually locking pages into primary storage is not advantageous to other system
objectives, such as maximizing throughput. For such implementations, memory locking is a &quot;hint&quot; to the implementation that the
application wishes to avoid situations that would cause long latencies in accessing memory. Furthermore, there are other
implementation-defined issues with minimizing memory access latencies that &quot;memory residency&quot; does not address-such as MMU reload
faults. The definition attempts to accommodate various implementations while allowing conforming applications to specify to the
implementation that they want or need the best memory access times that the implementation can provide.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_34"></a>Memory Object*</h5>

<p>The term &quot;memory object&quot; usually implies shared memory. If the object is the same as a filename in the file system name space
of the implementation, it is expected that the data written into the memory object be preserved on disk. A memory object may also
apply to a physical device on an implementation. In this case, writes to the memory object are sent to the controller for the
device and reads result in control registers being returned.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_35"></a>Mount Point*</h5>

<p>The directory on which a &quot;mounted file system&quot; is mounted. This term, like <i>mount</i>() and <i>umount</i>(), was not
included because it was implementation-defined.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_36"></a>Mounted File System*</h5>

<p>See <a href="#tag_01_03_00_20">File System</a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_37"></a>Name</h5>

<p>There are no explicit limits in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 on the sizes of names, words (see the definition of word in the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001), lines, or other objects. However, other implicit limits do apply: shell
script lines produced by many of the standard utilities cannot exceed {LINE_MAX} and the sum of exported variables comes under the
{ARG_MAX} limit. Historical shells dynamically allocate memory for names and words and parse incoming lines a character at a time.
Lines cannot have an arbitrary {LINE_MAX} limit because of historical practice, such as makefiles, where <a href=
"../utilities/make.html"><i>make</i></a> removes the &lt;newline&gt;s associated with the commands for a target and presents the
shell with one very long line. The text on INPUT FILES in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a
href="../utilities/xcu_chap01.html#tag_01_11">Section 1.11, Utility Description Defaults</a> does allow a shell to run out of
memory, but it cannot have arbitrary programming limits.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_38"></a>Native Implementation*</h5>

<p>This refers to an implementation of POSIX.1 that interfaces directly to an operating system kernel; see also <i>hosted
implementation</i> and <i>cooperating implementation</i>. A similar concept is a native UNIX system, which would be a kernel
derived from one of the original UNIX system products.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_39"></a>Nice Value</h5>

<p>This definition is not intended to suggest that all processes in a system have priorities that are comparable. Scheduling policy
extensions, such as adding realtime priorities, make the notion of a single underlying priority for all scheduling policies
problematic. Some implementations may implement the features related to <a href="../utilities/nice.html"><i>nice</i></a> to affect
all processes on the system, others to affect just the general time-sharing activities implied by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001,
and others may have no effect at all. Because of the use of &quot;implementation-defined&quot; in <a href=
"../utilities/nice.html"><i>nice</i></a> and <a href="../utilities/renice.html"><i>renice</i></a>, a wide range of implementation
strategies is possible.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_40"></a>Open File Description</h5>

<p>An &quot;open file description&quot;, as it is currently named, describes how a file is being accessed. What is currently called a
&quot;file descriptor&quot; is actually just an identifier or &quot;handle''; it does not actually describe anything.</p>

<p>The following alternate names were discussed:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For &quot;open file description'':<br>
&quot;open instance&quot;, &quot;file access description&quot;, &quot;open file information&quot;, and &quot;file access information&quot;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For &quot;file descriptor'':<br>
&quot;file handle&quot;, &quot;file number&quot; (cf., <a href="../functions/fileno.html"><i>fileno</i>()</a>). Some historical implementations use
the term &quot;file table entry&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_41"></a>Orphaned Process Group</h5>

<p>Historical implementations have a concept of an orphaned process, which is a process whose parent process has exited. When job
control is in use, it is necessary to prevent processes from being stopped in response to interactions with the terminal after they
no longer are controlled by a job control-cognizant program. Because signals generated by the terminal are sent to a process group
and not to individual processes, and because a signal may be provoked by a process that is not orphaned, but sent to another
process that is orphaned, it is necessary to define an orphaned process group. The definition assumes that a process group will be
manipulated as a group and that the job control-cognizant process controlling the group is outside of the group and is the parent
of at least one process in the group (so that state changes may be reported via <a href=
"../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>). Therefore, a group is considered to be controlled as long as at least one
process in the group has a parent that is outside of the process group, but within the session.</p>

<p>This definition of orphaned process groups ensures that a session leader's process group is always considered to be orphaned,
and thus it is prevented from stopping in response to terminal signals.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_42"></a>Page</h5>

<p>The term &quot;page&quot; is defined to support the description of the behavior of memory mapping for shared memory and memory mapped
files, and the description of the behavior of process memory locking. It is not intended to imply that shared memory/file mapping
and memory locking are applicable only to &quot;paged&quot; architectures. For the purposes of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, whatever the
granularity on which an architecture supports mapping or locking, this is considered to be a &quot;page&quot; . If an architecture cannot
support the memory mapping or locking functions specified by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 on any granularity, then these options
will not be implemented on the architecture.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_43"></a>Passwd File*</h5>

<p>Implementation-defined; see <a href="#tag_01_03_00_63">User Database</a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_44"></a>Parent Directory</h5>

<p>There may be more than one directory entry pointing to a given directory in some implementations. The wording here identifies
that exactly one of those is the parent directory. In pathname resolution, dot-dot is identified as the way that the unique
directory is identified. (That is, the parent directory is the one to which dot-dot points.) In the case of a remote file system,
if the same file system is mounted several times, it would appear as if they were distinct file systems (with interesting
synchronization properties).</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_45"></a>Pipe</h5>

<p>It proved convenient to define a pipe as a special case of a FIFO, even though historically the latter was not introduced until
System&nbsp;III and does not exist at all in 4.3 BSD.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_46"></a>Portable Filename Character Set</h5>

<p>The encoding of this character set is not specified-specifically, ASCII is not required. But the implementation must provide a
unique character code for each of the printable graphics specified by POSIX.1; see also <a href=
"xbd_chap04.html#tag_01_04_06"><i>Filenames</i></a> .</p>

<p>Situations where characters beyond the portable filename character set (or historically ASCII or the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991
standard) would be used (in a context where the portable filename character set or the ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard is required
by POSIX.1) are expected to be common. Although such a situation renders the use technically non-compliant, mutual agreement among
the users of an extended character set will make such use portable between those users. Such a mutual agreement could be formalized
as an optional extension to POSIX.1. (Making it required would eliminate too many possible systems, as even those systems using the
ISO/IEC&nbsp;646:1991 standard as a base character set extend their character sets for Western Europe and the rest of the world in
different ways.)</p>

<p>Nothing in POSIX.1 is intended to preclude the use of extended characters where interchange is not required or where mutual
agreement is obtained. It has been suggested that in several places &quot;should&quot; be used instead of &quot;shall&quot;. Because (in the worst
case) use of any character beyond the portable filename character set would render the program or data not portable to all possible
systems, no extensions are permitted in this context.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_47"></a>Regular File</h5>

<p>POSIX.1 does not intend to preclude the addition of structuring data (for example, record lengths) in the file, as long as such
data is not visible to an application that uses the features described in POSIX.1.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_48"></a>Root Directory</h5>

<p>This definition permits the operation of <i>chroot</i>(), even though that function is not in POSIX.1; see also <a href=
"xbd_chap04.html#tag_01_04_05"><i>File Hierarchy</i></a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_49"></a>Root File System*</h5>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_50"></a>Root of a File System*</h5>

<p>Implementation-defined; see <a href="#tag_01_03_00_35">Mount Point*</a> .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_51"></a>Signal</h5>

<p>The definition implies a double meaning for the term. Although a signal is an event, common usage implies that a signal is an
identifier of the class of event.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_52"></a>Superuser*</h5>

<p>This concept, with great historical significance to UNIX system users, has been replaced with the notion of appropriate
privileges.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_53"></a>Supplementary Group ID</h5>

<p>The POSIX.1-1990 standard is inconsistent in its treatment of supplementary groups. The definition of supplementary group ID
explicitly permits the effective group ID to be included in the set, but wording in the description of the <a href=
"../functions/setuid.html"><i>setuid</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/setgid.html"><i>setgid</i>()</a> functions states: &quot;Any
supplementary group IDs of the calling process remain unchanged by these function calls&quot;. In the case of <a href=
"../functions/setgid.html"><i>setgid</i>()</a> this contradicts that definition. In addition, some felt that the unspecified
behavior in the definition of supplementary group IDs adds unnecessary portability problems. The standard developers considered
several solutions to this problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Reword the description of <a href="../functions/setgid.html"><i>setgid</i>()</a> to permit it to change the supplementary group
IDs to reflect the new effective group ID. A problem with this is that it adds more &quot;may''s to the wording and does not address
the portability problems of this optional behavior.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Mandate the inclusion of the effective group ID in the supplementary set (giving {NGROUPS_MAX} a minimum value of 1). This is
the behavior of 4.4 BSD. In that system, the effective group ID is the first element of the array of supplementary group IDs (there
is no separate copy stored, and changes to the effective group ID are made only in the supplementary group set). By convention, the
initial value of the effective group ID is duplicated elsewhere in the array so that the initial value is not lost when executing a
set-group-ID program.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Change the definition of supplementary group ID to exclude the effective group ID and specify that the effective group ID does
not change the set of supplementary group IDs. This is the behavior of 4.2 BSD, 4.3 BSD, and System&nbsp;V Release 4.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Change the definition of supplementary group ID to exclude the effective group ID, and require that <a href=
"../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a> return the union of the effective group ID and the supplementary group
IDs.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Change the definition of {NGROUPS_MAX} to be one more than the number of supplementary group IDs, so it continues to be the
number of values returned by <a href="../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a> and existing applications continue to
work. This alternative is effectively the same as the second (and might actually have the same implementation).</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The standard developers decided to permit either 2 or 3. The effective group ID is orthogonal to the set of supplementary group
IDs, and it is implementation-defined whether <a href="../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a> returns this. If the
effective group ID is returned with the set of supplementary group IDs, then all changes to the effective group ID affect the
supplementary group set returned by <a href="../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a>. It is permissible to eliminate
duplicates from the list returned by <a href="../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a>. However, if a group ID is
contained in the set of supplementary group IDs, setting the group ID to that value and then to a different value should not remove
that value from the supplementary group IDs.</p>

<p>The definition of supplementary group IDs has been changed to not include the effective group ID. This simplifies permanent
rationale and makes the relevant functions easier to understand. The <a href="../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a>
function has been modified so that it can, on an implementation-defined basis, return the effective group ID. By making this
change, functions that modify the effective group ID do not need to discuss adding to the supplementary group list; the only view
into the supplementary group list that the application writer has is through the <a href=
"../functions/getgroups.html"><i>getgroups</i>()</a> function.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_54"></a>Symbolic Link</h5>

<p>Many implementations associate no attributes, including ownership with symbolic links. Security experts encouraged consideration
for defining these attributes as optional. Consideration was given to changing <a href="../functions/utime.html"><i>utime</i>()</a>
to allow modification of the times for a symbolic link, or as an alternative adding an <i>lutime</i>() interface. Modifications to
<a href="../functions/chown.html"><i>chown</i>()</a> were also considered: allow changing symbolic link ownership or alternatively
adding <a href="../functions/lchown.html"><i>lchown</i>()</a>. As a result of alignment with the Single UNIX Specification, the <a
href="../functions/lchown.html"><i>lchown</i>()</a> function is included as part of the XSI extension and XSI-conformant systems
may support an owner and a group associated with a symbolic link. There was no consensus to define further attributes for symbolic
links, and for systems not supporting the XSI extension only the file type bits in the <i>st_mode</i> member and the <i>st_size</i>
member of the <b>stat</b> structure are required to be applicable to symbolic links.</p>

<p>Historical implementations were followed when determining which interfaces should apply to symbolic links. Interfaces that
historically followed symbolic links include <a href="../functions/chmod.html"><i>chmod</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/link.html"><i>link</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/utime.html"><i>utime</i>()</a>. Interfaces that historically
do not follow symbolic links include <a href="../functions/chown.html"><i>chown</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/lstat.html"><i>lstat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/readlink.html"><i>readlink</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/rename.html"><i>rename</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/remove.html"><i>remove</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/rmdir.html"><i>rmdir</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a>.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 deviates from historical practice only in the case of <a href=
"../functions/chown.html"><i>chown</i>()</a>. Because there is no requirement for systems not supporting the XSI extension that
there is an association of ownership with symbolic links, there was no interface in the base standard to change ownership. In
addition, other implementations of symbolic links have modified <a href="../functions/chown.html"><i>chown</i>()</a> to follow
symbolic links.</p>

<p>In the case of symbolic links, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 states that a trailing slash is considered to be the final
component of a pathname rather than the pathname component that preceded it. This is the behavior of historical implementations.
For example, for <b>/a/b</b> and <b>/a/b/</b>, if <b>/a/b</b> is a symbolic link to a directory, then <b>/a/b</b> refers to the
symbolic link, and <b>/a/b/</b> is the same as <b>/a/b/.</b>, which is the directory to which the symbolic link points.</p>

<p>For multi-level security purposes, it is possible to have the link read mode govern permission for the <a href=
"../functions/readlink.html"><i>readlink</i>()</a> function. It is also possible that the read permissions of the directory
containing the link be used for this purpose. Implementations may choose to use either of these methods; however, this is not
current practice and neither method is specified.</p>

<p>Several reasons were advanced for requiring that when a symbolic link is used as the source argument to the <a href=
"../functions/link.html"><i>link</i>()</a> function, the resulting link will apply to the file named by the contents of the
symbolic link rather than to the symbolic link itself. This is the case in historical implementations. This action was preferred,
as it supported the traditional idea of persistence with respect to the target of a hard link. This decision is appropriate in
light of a previous decision not to require association of attributes with symbolic links, thereby allowing implementations which
do not use inodes. Opposition centered on the lack of symmetry on the part of the <a href=
"../functions/link.html"><i>link</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/unlink.html"><i>unlink</i>()</a> function pair with respect to
symbolic links.</p>

<p>Because a symbolic link and its referenced object coexist in the file system name space, confusion can arise in distinguishing
between the link itself and the referenced object. Historically, utilities and system calls have adopted their own link following
conventions in a somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> fashion. Rules for a uniform approach are outlined here, although historical practice has
been adhered to as much as was possible. To promote consistent system use, user-written utilities are encouraged to follow these
same rules.</p>

<p>Symbolic links are handled either by operating on the link itself, or by operating on the object referenced by the link. In the
latter case, an application or system call is said to &quot;follow&quot; the link. Symbolic links may reference other symbolic links, in
which case links are dereferenced until an object that is not a symbolic link is found, a symbolic link that references a file that
does not exist is found, or a loop is detected. (Current implementations do not detect loops, but have a limit on the number of
symbolic links that they will dereference before declaring it an error.)</p>

<p>There are four domains for which default symbolic link policy is established in a system. In almost all cases, there are utility
options that override this default behavior. The four domains are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Symbolic links specified to system calls that take filename arguments</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Symbolic links specified as command line filename arguments to utilities that are not performing a traversal of a file
hierarchy</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Symbolic links referencing files not of type directory, specified to utilities that are performing a traversal of a file
hierarchy</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Symbolic links referencing files of type directory, specified to utilities that are performing a traversal of a file
hierarchy</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br>
<p><i>First Domain</i></p>

<p>The first domain is considered in earlier rationale.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Second Domain</i></p>

<p>The reason this category is restricted to utilities that are not traversing the file hierarchy is that some standard utilities
take an option that specifies a hierarchical traversal, but by default operate on the arguments themselves. Generally, users
specifying the option for a file hierarchy traversal wish to operate on a single, physical hierarchy, and therefore symbolic links,
which may reference files outside of the hierarchy, are ignored. For example, <a href="../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a>
<i>owner file</i> is a different operation from the same command with the <b>-R</b> option specified. In this example, the behavior
of the command <a href="../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a> <i>owner file</i> is described here, while the behavior of the
command <a href="../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a> <b>-R</b> <i>owner file</i> is described in the third and fourth
domains.</p>

<p>The general rule is that the utilities in this category follow symbolic links named as arguments.</p>

<p>Exceptions in the second domain are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="../utilities/mv.html"><i>mv</i></a> and <a href="../utilities/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> utilities do not follow
symbolic links named as arguments, but respectively attempt to rename or delete them.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> utility is also an exception to this rule. For compatibility with historical
systems, when the <b>-R</b> option is not specified, the <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> utility follows symbolic
links named as arguments if the <b>-L</b> option is specified or if the <b>-F</b>, <b>-d</b>, or <b>-l</b> options are not
specified. (If the <b>-L</b> option is specified, <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> always follows symbolic links; it is
the only utility where the <b>-L</b> option affects its behavior even though a tree walk is not being performed.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>All other standard utilities, when not traversing a file hierarchy, always follow symbolic links named as arguments.</p>

<p>Historical practice is that the <b>-h</b> option is specified if standard utilities are to act upon symbolic links instead of
upon their targets. Examples of commands that have historically had a <b>-h</b> option for this purpose are the <a href=
"../utilities/chgrp.html"><i>chgrp</i></a>, <a href="../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a>, <a href=
"../utilities/file.html"><i>file</i></a>, and <a href="../utilities/test.html"><i>test</i></a> utilities.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Third Domain</i></p>

<p>The third domain is symbolic links, referencing files not of type directory, specified to utilities that are performing a
traversal of a file hierarchy. (This includes symbolic links specified as command line filename arguments or encountered during the
traversal.)</p>

<p>The intention of the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is that the operation that the utility is
performing is applied to the symbolic link itself, if that operation is applicable to symbolic links. The reason that the operation
is not required is that symbolic links in some implementations do not have such attributes as a file owner, and therefore the <a
href="../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a> operation would be meaningless. If symbolic links on the system have an owner, it
is the intention that the utility <a href="../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a> cause the owner of the symbolic link to
change. If symbolic links do not have an owner, the symbolic link should be ignored. Specifically, by default, no change should be
made to the file referenced by the symbolic link.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Fourth Domain</i></p>

<p>The fourth domain is symbolic links referencing files of type directory, specified to utilities that are performing a traversal
of a file hierarchy. (This includes symbolic links specified as command line filename arguments or encountered during the
traversal.)</p>

<p>Most standard utilities do not, by default, indirect into the file hierarchy referenced by the symbolic link. (The Shell and
Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 uses the informal term &quot;physical walk&quot; to describe this case. The case where
the utility does indirect through the symbolic link is termed a &quot;logical walk&quot;.)</p>

<p>There are three reasons for the default to be a physical walk:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>With very few exceptions, a physical walk has been the historical default on UNIX systems supporting symbolic links. Because
some utilities (that is, <a href="../utilities/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a>) must default to a physical walk, regardless, changing
historical practice in this regard would be confusing to users and needlessly incompatible.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For systems where symbolic links have the historical file attributes (that is, <i>owner</i>, <i>group</i>, <i>mode</i>),
defaulting to a logical traversal would require the addition of a new option to the commands to modify the attributes of the link
itself. This is painful and more complex than the alternatives.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There is a security issue with defaulting to a logical walk. Historically, the command <a href=
"../utilities/chown.html"><i>chown</i></a> <b>-R</b> <i>user file</i> has been safe for the superuser because <i>setuid</i> and
<i>setgid</i> bits were lost when the ownership of the file was changed. If the walk were logical, changing ownership would no
longer be safe because a user might have inserted a symbolic link pointing to any file in the tree. Again, this would necessitate
the addition of an option to the commands doing hierarchy traversal to not indirect through the symbolic links, and historical
scripts doing recursive walks would instantly become security problems. While this is mostly an issue for system administrators, it
is preferable to not have different defaults for different classes of users.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>However, the standard developers agreed to leave it unspecified to achieve consensus.</p>

<p>As consistently as possible, users may cause standard utilities performing a file hierarchy traversal to follow any symbolic
links named on the command line, regardless of the type of file they reference, by specifying the <b>-H</b> (for half logical)
option. This option is intended to make the command line name space look like the logical name space.</p>

<p>As consistently as possible, users may cause standard utilities performing a file hierarchy traversal to follow any symbolic
links named on the command line as well as any symbolic links encountered during the traversal, regardless of the type of file they
reference, by specifying the <b>-L</b> (for logical) option. This option is intended to make the entire name space look like the
logical name space.</p>

<p>For consistency, implementors are encouraged to use the <b>-P</b> (for &quot;physical&quot;) flag to specify the physical walk in
utilities that do logical walks by default for whatever reason. The only standard utilities that require the <b>-P</b> option are
<a href="../utilities/cd.html"><i>cd</i></a> and <a href="../utilities/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a>; see the note below.</p>

<p>When one or more of the <b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, and <b>-P</b> flags can be specified, the last one specified determines the
behavior of the utility. This permits users to alias commands so that the default behavior is a logical walk and then override that
behavior on the command line.</p>

<p><i>Exceptions in the Third and Fourth Domains</i></p>

<p>The <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> and <a href="../utilities/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> utilities are exceptions to
these rules. The <a href="../utilities/rm.html"><i>rm</i></a> utility never follows symbolic links and does not support the
<b>-H</b>, <b>-L</b>, or <b>-P</b> options. Some historical versions of <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> always
followed symbolic links given on the command line whether the <b>-L</b> option was specified or not. Historical versions of <a
href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> did not support the <b>-H</b> option. In IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, unless one of
the <b>-H</b> or <b>-L</b> options is specified, the <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> utility only follows symbolic
links to directories that are given as operands. The <a href="../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> utility does not support the
<b>-P</b> option.</p>

<p>The Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires that the standard utilities <a href=
"../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a>, <a href="../utilities/find.html"><i>find</i></a>, and <a href=
"../utilities/pax.html"><i>pax</i></a> detect infinite loops when doing logical walks; that is, a directory, or more commonly a
symbolic link, that refers to an ancestor in the current file hierarchy. If the file system itself is corrupted, causing the
infinite loop, it may be impossible to recover. Because <a href="../utilities/find.html"><i>find</i></a> and <a href=
"../utilities/ls.html"><i>ls</i></a> are often used in system administration and security applications, they should attempt to
recover and continue as best as they can. The <a href="../utilities/pax.html"><i>pax</i></a> utility should terminate because the
archive it was creating is by definition corrupted. Other, less vital, utilities should probably simply terminate as well.
Implementations are strongly encouraged to detect infinite loops in all utilities.</p>

<p>Historical practice is shown in <a href="#tagtcjh_1">Historical Practice for Symbolic Links</a> . The heading <b>SVID3</b>
stands for the Third Edition of the System&nbsp;V Interface Definition.</p>

<p>Historically, several shells have had built-in versions of the <a href="../utilities/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a> utility. In some
of these shells, <a href="../utilities/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a> reported the physical path, and in others, the logical path.
Implementations of the shell corresponding to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 must report the logical path by default. Earlier
versions of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 did not require the <a href="../utilities/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a> utility to be a
built-in utility. Now that <a href="../utilities/pwd.html"><i>pwd</i></a> is required to set an environment variable in the current
shell execution environment, it must be a built-in utility.</p>

<p>The <a href="../utilities/cd.html"><i>cd</i></a> command is required, by default, to treat the filename dot-dot logically.
Implementors are required to support the <b>-P</b> flag in <a href="../utilities/cd.html"><i>cd</i></a> so that users can have
their current environment handled physically. In 4.3 BSD, <a href="../utilities/chgrp.html"><i>chgrp</i></a> during tree traversal
changed the group of the symbolic link, not the target. Symbolic links in 4.4 BSD do not have <i>owner</i>, <i>group</i>,
<i>mode</i>, or other standard UNIX system file attributes.<br>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_55"></a>Synchronously-Generated Signal</h5>

<p>Those signals that may be generated synchronously include SIGABRT, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE, SIGPIPE, and SIGSEGV.</p>

<p>Any signal sent via the <a href="../functions/raise.html"><i>raise</i>()</a> function or a <a href=
"../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> function targeting the current process is also considered synchronous.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_56"></a>System Call*</h5>

<p>The distinction between a &quot;system call&quot; and a &quot;library routine&quot; is an implementation detail that may differ between
implementations and has thus been excluded from POSIX.1.</p>

<p>See &quot;Interface, Not Implementation&quot; in .</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_57"></a>System Reboot</h5>

<p>A &quot;system reboot&quot; is an event initiated by an unspecified circumstance that causes all processes (other than special system
processes) to be terminated in an implementation-defined manner, after which any changes to the state and contents of files created
or written to by a Conforming POSIX.1 Application prior to the event are implementation-defined.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_58"></a>Synchronized I/O Data (and File) Integrity Completion</h5>

<p>These terms specify that for synchronized read operations, pending writes must be successfully completed before the read
operation can complete. This is motivated by two circumstances. Firstly, when synchronizing processes can access the same file, but
not share common buffers (such as for a remote file system), this requirement permits the reading process to guarantee that it can
read data written remotely. Secondly, having data written synchronously is insufficient to guarantee the order with respect to a
subsequent write by a reading process, and thus this extra read semantic is necessary.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_59"></a>Text File</h5>

<p>The term &quot;text file&quot; does not prevent the inclusion of control or other non-printable characters (other than NUL). Therefore,
standard utilities that list text files as inputs or outputs are either able to process the special characters or they explicitly
describe their limitations within their individual descriptions. The definition of &quot;text file&quot; has caused controversy. The only
difference between text and binary files is that text files have lines of less than {LINE_MAX} bytes, with no NUL characters, each
terminated by a &lt;newline&gt;. The definition allows a file with a single &lt;newline&gt;, but not a totally empty file, to be
called a text file. If a file ends with an incomplete line it is not strictly a text file by this definition. The &lt;newline&gt;
referred to in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is not some generic line separator, but a single character; files created on systems
where they use multiple characters for ends of lines are not portable to all conforming systems without some translation process
unspecified by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_60"></a>Thread</h5>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defines a thread to be a flow of control within a process. Each thread has a minimal amount of
private state; most of the state associated with a process is shared among all of the threads in the process. While most
multi-thread extensions to POSIX have taken this approach, others have made different decisions. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>The choice to put threads within a process does not constrain implementations to implement threads in that manner. However, all
functions have to behave as though threads share the indicated state information with the process from which they were
created.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Threads need to share resources in order to cooperate. Memory has to be widely shared between threads in order for the threads
to cooperate at a fine level of granularity. Threads keep data structures and the locks protecting those data structures in shared
memory. For a data structure to be usefully shared between threads, such structures should not refer to any data that can only be
interpreted meaningfully by a single thread. Thus, any system resources that might be referred to in data structures need to be
shared between all threads. File descriptors, pathnames, and pointers to stack variables are all things that programmers want to
share between their threads. Thus, the file descriptor table, the root directory, the current working directory, and the address
space have to be shared.</p>

<p>Library implementations are possible as long as the effective behavior is as if system services invoked by one thread do not
suspend other threads. This may be difficult for some library implementations on systems that do not provide asynchronous
facilities.</p>

<p>See <a href="xsh_chap02.html#tag_03_02_09"><i>Threads</i></a> for additional rationale.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_61"></a>Thread ID</h5>

<p>See <a href="xsh_chap02.html#tag_03_02_09_09"><i>Thread IDs</i></a> for additional rationale.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_62"></a>Thread-Safe Function</h5>

<p>All functions required by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 need to be thread-safe; see <a href=
"xbd_chap04.html#tag_01_04_16"><i>Thread-Safety</i></a> and <a href="xsh_chap02.html#tag_03_02_09_08"><i>Thread-Safety</i></a> for
additional rationale.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_63"></a>User Database</h5>

<p>There are no references in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to a &quot;passwd file&quot; or a &quot;group file&quot;, and there is no requirement
that the <i>group</i> or <i>passwd</i> databases be kept in files containing editable text. Many large timesharing systems use
<i>passwd</i> databases that are hashed for speed. Certain security classifications prohibit certain information in the
<i>passwd</i> database from being publicly readable.</p>

<p>The term &quot;encoded&quot; is used instead of &quot;encrypted&quot; in order to avoid the implementation connotations (such as reversibility
or use of a particular algorithm) of the latter term.</p>

<p>The <a href="../functions/getgrent.html"><i>getgrent</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/setgrent.html"><i>setgrent</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/endgrent.html"><i>endgrent</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getpwent.html"><i>getpwent</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/setpwent.html"><i>setpwent</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/endpwent.html"><i>endpwent</i>()</a> functions are
not included as part of the base standard because they provide a linear database search capability that is not generally useful
(the <a href="../functions/getpwuid.html"><i>getpwuid</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/getpwnam.html"><i>getpwnam</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/getgrgid.html"><i>getgrgid</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/getgrnam.html"><i>getgrnam</i>()</a> functions
are provided for keyed lookup) and because in certain distributed systems, especially those with different authentication domains,
it may not be possible or desirable to provide an application with the ability to browse the system databases indiscriminately.
They are provided on XSI-conformant systems due to their historical usage by many existing applications.</p>

<p>A change from historical implementations is that the structures used by these functions have fields of the types <b>gid_t</b>
and <b>uid_t</b>, which are required to be defined in the <a href="../basedefs/sys/types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a>
header. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires implementations to ensure that these types are defined by inclusion of <a href=
"../basedefs/grp.h.html"><i>&lt;grp.h&gt;</i></a> and <a href="../basedefs/pwd.h.html"><i>&lt;pwd.h&gt;</i></a>, respectively,
without imposing any name space pollution or errors from redefinition of types.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is silent about the content of the strings containing user or group names. These could be digit
strings. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 is also silent as to whether such digit strings bear any relationship to the corresponding
(numeric) user or group ID.<br>
</p>

<p><i>Database Access</i></p>

<p>The thread-safe versions of the user and group database access functions return values in user-supplied buffers instead of
possibly using static data areas that may be overwritten by each call.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_64"></a>Virtual Processor*</h5>

<p>The term &quot;virtual processor&quot; was chosen as a neutral term describing all kernel-level schedulable entities, such as processes,
Mach tasks, or lightweight processes. Implementing threads using multiple processes as virtual processors, or implementing
multiplexed threads above a virtual processor layer, should be possible, provided some mechanism has also been implemented for
sharing state between processes or virtual processors. Many systems may also wish to provide implementations of threads on systems
providing &quot;shared processes&quot; or &quot;variable-weight processes&quot;. It was felt that exposing such implementation details would
severely limit the type of systems upon which the threads interface could be supported and prevent certain types of valid
implementations. It was also determined that a virtual processor interface was out of the scope of the Rationale (Informative)
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_03_00_65"></a>XSI</h5>

<p>This is introduced to allow IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 to be adopted as an IEEE standard and an Open Group Technical
Standard, serving both the POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification in a core set of volumes.</p>

<p>The term &quot;XSI&quot; has been used for 10 years in connection with the XPG series and the first and second versions of the base
volumes of the Single UNIX Specification. The XSI margin code was introduced to denote the extended or more restrictive semantics
beyond POSIX that are applicable to UNIX systems.</p>
