<h2><a name="tag_13"></a>Headers</h2>

<p>This chapter describes the contents of headers.</p>

<p>Headers contain function prototypes, the definition of symbolic constants, common structures, preprocessor macros, and defined
types. Each function in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 specifies the headers that an application
shall include in order to use that function. In most cases, only one header is required. These headers are present on an
application development system; they need not be present on the target execution system.</p>
