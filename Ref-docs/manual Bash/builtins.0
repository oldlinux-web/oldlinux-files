       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in
       this section as accepting options preceded by -- accepts ----
       to signify the end of the options.
       :: [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond  expand-
              ing _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s and performing any specified redirec-
              tions.  A zero exit code is returned.

        ..  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]

              Read and execute commands from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in the cur-
              rent  shell  environment and return the exit status
              of the last command  executed  from  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.   If
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  does  not  contain a slash, file names in
              PPAATTHH are used  to  find  the  directory  containing
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.   The  file searched for in PPAATTHH need not
              be executable.  When bbaasshh is not in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, the
              current  directory  is searched if no file is found
              in PPAATTHH.  If the ssoouurrcceeppaatthh  option  to  the  sshhoopptt
              builtin  command  is  turned  off,  the PPAATTHH is not
              searched.  If  any  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s  are  supplied,  they
              become  the  positional parameters when _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is
              executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters  are
              unchanged.   The return status is the status of the
              last command exited within the script (0 if no com-
              mands  are  executed), and false if _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is not
              found or cannot be read.

       aalliiaass [--pp] [_n_a_m_e[=_v_a_l_u_e] ...]
              AAlliiaass with no  arguments  or  with  the  --pp  option
              prints  the  list  of  aliases  in  the  form aalliiaass
              _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e on standard output.  When arguments  are
              supplied,  an  alias is defined for each _n_a_m_e whose
              _v_a_l_u_e is given.  A trailing space in  _v_a_l_u_e  causes
              the  next word to be checked for alias substitution
              when the alias is expanded.  For each _n_a_m_e  in  the
              argument  list  for which no _v_a_l_u_e is supplied, the
              name and value of  the  alias  is  printed.   AAlliiaass
              returns  true  unless  a _n_a_m_e is given for which no
              alias has been defined.

              not present, the shell's notion of the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t  _j_o_b
              is  used.  bbgg _j_o_b_s_p_e_c returns 0 unless run when job
              control is disabled or, when run with  job  control
              enabled,  if _j_o_b_s_p_e_c was not found or started with-
              out job control.

              that  of  _._i_n_p_u_t_r_c, but each binding must be passed
              as  a   separate   argument;   e.g.,   '"\C-x\C-r":

              loop.   If  _n is specified, break _n levels.  _n must
              be >= 1.  If  _n  is  greater  than  the  number  of
              enclosing  loops,  all  enclosing loops are exited.
              The return value is 0 unless the shell is not  exe-
              cuting a loop when bbrreeaakk is executed.

              Execute  the  specified  shell  builtin, passing it
              _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, and return its  exit  status.   This  is
              useful  when  defining a function whose name is the
              same as a shell builtin, retaining the  functional-
              ity  of  the  builtin  within the function.  The ccdd
              builtin is commonly redefined this way.  The return
              status  is  false  if  _s_h_e_l_l_-_b_u_i_l_t_i_n is not a shell
              builtin command.

       ccdd [--LLPP] [_d_i_r]
              Change the current directory to _d_i_r.  The  variable
              HHOOMMEE  is  the  default  _d_i_r.   The  variable CCDDPPAATTHH
              defines the search path for the directory  contain-
              ing _d_i_r.  Alternative directory names in CCDDPPAATTHH are
              separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in
              CCDDPPAATTHH  is the same as the current directory, i.e.,
              ``..''.  If _d_i_r begins with a slash (/), then CCDDPPAATTHH
              is not used. The --PP option says to use the physical
              directory structure instead of  following  symbolic
              links  (see  also  the --PP option to the sseett builtin
              command); the --LL option forces symbolic links to be
              followed.   An argument of -- is equivalent to $$OOLLDD--
              PPWWDD.  The return value is true if the directory was
              successfully changed; false otherwise.

       ccoommmmaanndd [--ppVVvv] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g ...]
              Run  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with _a_r_g_s suppressing the normal shell
              function lookup. Only builtin commands or  commands
              found  in  the PPAATTHH are executed.  If the --pp option
              is given, the search for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is performed using
              a default value for PPAATTHH that is guaranteed to find
              all of the standard utilities.  If either the --VV or
              --vv  option is supplied, a description of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
              printed.  The --vv option causes a single word  indi-
              cating the command or file name used to invoke _c_o_m_-
              _m_a_n_d to be displayed; the --VV option produces a more
              verbose  description.   If  the  --VV or --vv option is
              supplied, the exit  status  is  0  if  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  was
              found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied
              and an error occurred or _c_o_m_m_a_n_d cannot  be  found,
              the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status
              of the ccoommmmaanndd builtin is the exit status  of  _c_o_m_-
              _m_a_n_d.

                              also be specified as --vv.
              --GG _g_l_o_b_p_a_t
                      The  filename  expansion pattern _g_l_o_b_p_a_t is
                      expanded to generate the  possible  comple-
                      tions.
              --WW _w_o_r_d_l_i_s_t
                      The  _w_o_r_d_l_i_s_t is split using the characters
                      in the IIFFSS special variable as  delimiters,
                      and  each  resultant word is expanded.  The
                      possible completions are the members of the
                      resultant  list  which match the word being
                      completed.
              --CC _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                      _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed in a subshell  environ-
                      ment,  and its output is used as the possi-
                      ble completions.
              --FF _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
                      The shell function _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n is executed  in
                      the  current  shell  environment.   When it
                      finishes,  the  possible  completions   are
                      retrieved  from  the value of the CCOOMMPPRREEPPLLYY
                      array variable.
              --XX _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t
                      _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is a pattern as used for filename
                      expansion.   It  is  applied to the list of
                      possible completions generated by the  pre-
                      ceding options and arguments, and each com-
                      pletion matching _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is removed  from
                      the list.  A leading !! in _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t negates
                      the pattern; in this case,  any  completion
                      not matching _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is removed.
              --PP _p_r_e_f_i_x
                      _p_r_e_f_i_x  is  added  at the beginning of each
                      possible completion after all other options
                      have been applied.
              --SS _s_u_f_f_i_x
                      _s_u_f_f_i_x is appended to each possible comple-
                      tion after  all  other  options  have  been
                      applied.

              The  return  value is true unless an invalid option
              is supplied, an option other than --pp or --rr is  sup-
              plied  without  a _n_a_m_e argument, an attempt is made
              to remove a completion specification for a _n_a_m_e for

              Declare variables and/or give them attributes.   If
              no _n_a_m_es are given then display the values of vari-
              ables.  The --pp option will display  the  attributes
              and  values  of  each _n_a_m_e.  When --pp is used, addi-
              tional options are ignored.  The --FF option inhibits
              the display of function definitions; only the func-
              tion name  and  attributes  are  printed.   The  --FF
              option  implies  --ff.   The following options can be
              used to restrict output to variables with the spec-
              ified attribute or to give variables attributes:
              --aa     Each  _n_a_m_e  is an array variable (see AArrrraayyss
                     above).
              --ff     Use function names only.
              --ii     The  variable  is  treated  as  an  integer;
                     arithmetic evaluation (see AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUU--
                     AATTIIOONN )) is performed when  the  variable  is
                     assigned a value.
              --rr     Make  _n_a_m_es  readonly.   These  names cannot
                     then  be  assigned  values   by   subsequent
                     assignment statements or unset.
              --xx     Mark _n_a_m_es for export to subsequent commands
                     via the environment.

              Using `+' instead of `-' turns  off  the  attribute
              instead, with the exception that ++aa may not be used
              to destroy an array variable.  When used in a func-
              tion, makes each _n_a_m_e local, as with the llooccaall com-
              mand.  The return value  is  0  unless  an  invalid
              option is encountered, an attempt is made to define
              a function using ``-f foo=bar'', an attempt is made
              to  assign  a  value  to  a  readonly  variable, an
              attempt is made to assign a value to an array vari-
              able  without  using the compound assignment syntax
              (see AArrrraayyss above), one of the _n_a_m_e_s is not a valid
              shell variable name, an attempt is made to turn off
              readonly status for a readonly variable, an attempt
              is made to turn off array status for an array vari-

                     without options, starting with zero.
              --cc     Clears the directory stack by  deleting  all
                     of the entries.
              --ll     Produces a longer listing; the default list-
                     ing format uses a tilde to denote  the  home
                     directory.
              --pp     Print the directory stack with one entry per

              --vv     Print the directory stack with one entry per
                     line, prefixing each entry with its index in
                     the stack.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid  option  is

              shell receives a SSIIGGHHUUPP.  If no _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is present,
              and  neither  the --aa nor the --rr option is supplied,
              the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b is used.  If  no  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  is  sup-
              plied,  the  --aa  option means to remove or mark all
              jobs; the --rr  option  without  a  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  argument
              restricts  operation  to  running jobs.  The return
              value is 0 unless a  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  does  not  specify  a
              valid job.

              Output the _a_r_gs, separated by spaces, followed by a
              newline.  The return status is always 0.  If --nn  is
              specified,  the trailing newline is suppressed.  If
              the --ee option is given, interpretation of the  fol-
              lowing  backslash-escaped  characters  is  enabled.
              The --EE option disables the interpretation of  these
              escape  characters,  even on systems where they are
              interpreted by default.  The xxppgg__eecchhoo shell  option
              may be used to dynamically determine whether or not
              eecchhoo expands these escape  characters  by  default.
              eecchhoo  does  not  interpret  ----  to  mean the end of
              options.   eecchhoo  interprets  the  following  escape
              sequences:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\cc     suppress trailing newline

              Enable and disable builtin  shell  commands.   Dis-
              abling  a  builtin  allows a disk command which has
              the same name as a shell  builtin  to  be  executed
              without specifying a full pathname, even though the
              shell normally searches for  builtins  before  disk
              commands.   If  --nn  is used, each _n_a_m_e is disabled;
              otherwise, _n_a_m_e_s are enabled.  For example, to  use
              the  tteesstt  binary found via the PPAATTHH instead of the
              shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.  The
              --ff  option  means  to  load the new builtin command
              _n_a_m_e from shared object _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, on  systems  that
              support dynamic loading.  The --dd option will delete
              a builtin previously loaded with --ff.   If  no  _n_a_m_e
              arguments  are  given,  or if the --pp option is sup-
              plied, a list of shell builtins is  printed.   With
              no other option arguments, the list consists of all
              enabled shell builtins.  If --nn  is  supplied,  only
              disabled  builtins are printed.  If --aa is supplied,
              the list printed includes  all  builtins,  with  an
              indication  of  whether or not each is enabled.  If
              --ss is supplied, the output  is  restricted  to  the
              POSIX  _s_p_e_c_i_a_l  builtins.   The  return  value is 0
              unless a _n_a_m_e is not a shell builtin or there is an
              error loading a new builtin from a shared object.

       eevvaall [_a_r_g ...]
              The  _a_r_gs are read and concatenated together into a
              single command.  This command is then read and exe-
              cuted by the shell, and its exit status is returned
              as the value of eevvaall.  If there  are  no  _a_r_g_s,  or
              only null arguments, eevvaall returns 0.

              If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, it replaces the shell.  No
              new process is created.  The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s  become  the
              arguments  to  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.   If  the --ll option is sup-
              plied, the shell places a dash at the beginning  of
              the  zeroth  arg  passed  to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  This is what
              _l_o_g_i_n(1) does.  The --cc option causes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to  be
              executed  with an empty environment.  If --aa is sup-
              plied, the shell passes _n_a_m_e as the zeroth argument

              cuted for  some  reason,  a  non-interactive  shell
              exits, unless the shell option eexxeeccffaaiill is enabled,
              in which case it returns failure.   An  interactive
              shell  returns  failure  if the file cannot be exe-
              cuted.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is not specified,  any  redirec-
              tions  take  effect  in  the current shell, and the
              return status is 0.   If  there  is  a  redirection
              error, the return status is 1.

       eexxiitt [_n]
              Cause  the  shell to exit with a status of _n.  If _n
              is omitted, the exit status is  that  of  the  last
              command  executed.   A  trap  on  EEXXIITT  is executed
              before the shell terminates.

              The supplied _n_a_m_e_s are marked for automatic  export
              to  the  environment  of subsequently executed com-
              mands.  If the --ff option is given, the _n_a_m_e_s  refer
              to  functions.  If no _n_a_m_e_s are given, or if the --pp
              option is supplied, a list of all  names  that  are
              exported  in  this shell is printed.  The --nn option
              causes the export property to be removed  from  the
              named  variables.  eexxppoorrtt returns an exit status of
              0 unless an invalid option is encountered,  one  of
              the _n_a_m_e_s is not a valid shell variable name, or --ff

              Fix Command.  In the first form, a  range  of  com-
              mands  from _f_i_r_s_t to _l_a_s_t is selected from the his-
              tory list.  _F_i_r_s_t and _l_a_s_t may be  specified  as  a
              string  (to  locate the last command beginning with
              that string) or as a number (an index into the his-
              tory  list,  where  a negative number is used as an
              offset from the current command number).   If  _l_a_s_t
              is  not  specified it is set to the current command
              for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the  last
              10  commands)  and to _f_i_r_s_t otherwise.  If _f_i_r_s_t is
              not specified it is set to the previous command for
              editing and -16 for listing.

              The  --nn  option suppresses the command numbers when
              listing.  The --rr option reverses the order  of  the
              commands.   If the --ll option is given, the commands
              are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the edi-
              tor  given by _e_n_a_m_e is invoked on a file containing
              those commands.  If _e_n_a_m_e is not given,  the  value
              of  the  FFCCEEDDIITT  variable is used, and the value of
              EEDDIITTOORR if FFCCEEDDIITT is not set.  If  neither  variable
              is  set,  is  used.   When editing is complete, the

              edited commands are echoed and executed.

              In the second form, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  is  re-executed  after
              each  instance of _p_a_t is replaced by _r_e_p.  A useful
              alias to use with this is ``r=fc -s'', so that typ-
              ing  ``r  cc'' runs the last command beginning with
              ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the  last  com-
              mand.

              If  the  first  form is used, the return value is 0
              unless an invalid option is encountered or _f_i_r_s_t or
              _l_a_s_t specify history lines out of range.  If the --ee
              option is supplied, the return value is  the  value
              of the last command executed or failure if an error
              occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the
              second  form  is used, the return status is that of
              the command re-executed, unless _c_m_d does not  spec-
              ify  a valid history line, in which case ffcc returns
              failure.

              Resume _j_o_b_s_p_e_c in the foreground, and make  it  the
              current  job.   If  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  is  not  present,  the
              shell's notion of the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t  _j_o_b  is  used.   The
              return value is that of the command placed into the
              foreground, or failure if run when job  control  is
              disabled  or, when run with job control enabled, if
              _j_o_b_s_p_e_c does not specify a  valid  job  or  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c
              specifies  a  job that was started without job con-
              trol.

              ggeettooppttss is used by shell procedures to parse  posi-
              tional  parameters.   _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g contains the option
              characters to be recognized; if a character is fol-
              lowed by a colon, the option is expected to have an
              argument, which should  be  separated  from  it  by
              white  space.   The colon and question mark charac-
              ters may not be used as  option  characters.   Each
              time  it is invoked, ggeettooppttss places the next option
              in the shell variable _n_a_m_e, initializing _n_a_m_e if it
              does  not exist, and the index of the next argument
              to be processed into the variable  OOPPTTIINNDD.   OOPPTTIINNDD
              is  initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell
              script is invoked.   When  an  option  requires  an
              argument,  ggeettooppttss  places  that  argument into the
              variable OOPPTTAARRGG.  The shell does not  reset  OOPPTTIINNDD
              automatically;  it  must  be manually reset between
              multiple calls to ggeettooppttss  within  the  same  shell
              invocation  if  a  new  set  of parameters is to be
              used.

              When the end of  options  is  encountered,  ggeettooppttss
              exits  with  a  return  value  greater  than  zero.

              OOPPTTIINNDD is set to the index of the first  non-option
              argument, and nnaammee is set to ?.

              ggeettooppttss  normally parses the positional parameters,
              but if more arguments are given  in  _a_r_g_s,  ggeettooppttss
              parses those instead.

              ggeettooppttss  can  report  errors  in  two ways.  If the
              first character of _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g  is  a  colon,  _s_i_l_e_n_t
              error reporting is used.  In normal operation diag-
              nostic messages are printed when invalid options or
              missing  option  arguments are encountered.  If the
              variable OOPPTTEERRRR is set to 0, no error messages will
              be  displayed,  even if the first character of _o_p_t_-
              _s_t_r_i_n_g is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, ggeettooppttss places ? into
              _n_a_m_e  and,  if  not silent, prints an error message
              and unsets  OOPPTTAARRGG.   If  ggeettooppttss  is  silent,  the
              option  character  found is placed in OOPPTTAARRGG and no
              diagnostic message is printed.

              If a required argument is not found, and ggeettooppttss is
              not  silent, a question mark (??) is placed in _n_a_m_e,
              OOPPTTAARRGG  is  unset,  and  a  diagnostic  message  is
              printed.  If ggeettooppttss is silent, then a colon (::) is
              placed in _n_a_m_e and OOPPTTAARRGG  is  set  to  the  option
              character found.

              ggeettooppttss  returns  true  if  an option, specified or
              unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the end
              of options is encountered or an error occurs.

              For each _n_a_m_e, the full file name of the command is
              determined by searching the  directories  in  $$PPAATTHH
              and  remembered.   If the --pp option is supplied, no
              path search is performed, and _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is  used  as

              processes  named  by  _p_i_d  or  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c.  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is
              either a signal name such as SSIIGGKKIILLLL  or  a  signal
              number; _s_i_g_n_u_m is a signal number.  If _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is a
              signal name, the name may be given with or  without
              the  SSIIGG  prefix.   If _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is not present, then
              SSIIGGTTEERRMM is assumed.  An argument of  --ll  lists  the
              signal  names.   If any arguments are supplied when
              --ll is given, the names of the signals corresponding
              to  the arguments are listed, and the return status
              is 0.  The _e_x_i_t___s_t_a_t_u_s argument to --ll is  a  number

              For each argument, a local variable named  _n_a_m_e  is
              created, and assigned _v_a_l_u_e.  The _o_p_t_i_o_n can be any

              Removes entries from the directory stack.  With  no
              arguments,  removes  the  top  directory  from  the
              stack, and performs a ccdd to the new top  directory.
              Arguments,  if  supplied,  have the following mean-
              ings:
              ++_n     Removes the _nth entry counting from the left
                     of  the  list  shown  by ddiirrss, starting with
                     zero.  For example: ``popd +0'' removes  the
                     first directory, ``popd +1'' the second.
              --_n     Removes  the  _nth  entry  counting  from the
                     right of the list shown  by  ddiirrss,  starting
                     with zero.  For example: ``popd -0'' removes
                     the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next  to
                     last.
              --nn     Suppresses  the  normal  change of directory
                     when removing directories from the stack, so
                     that only the stack is manipulated.

              If  the  ppooppdd command is successful, a ddiirrss is per-
              formed as well, and the return status is  0.   ppooppdd
              returns  false if an invalid option is encountered,
              the directory stack is empty, a non-existent direc-
              tory  stack  entry  is  specified, or the directory
              change fails.

              put under the control of the _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t is
              a character string which contains  three  types  of
              objects:  plain characters, which are simply copied
              to standard  output,  character  escape  sequences,
              which are converted and copied to the standard out-
              put,  and  format  specifications,  each  of  which
              causes  printing  of  the next successive _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.
              In addition to the standard _p_r_i_n_t_f(1)  formats,  %%bb
              causes  pprriinnttff to expand backslash escape sequences
              in the corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t, and %%qq causes pprriinnttff
              to  output  the  corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t in a format
              that can be reused as shell input.

              The _f_o_r_m_a_t is reused as necessary to consume all of
              the  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s.   If the _f_o_r_m_a_t requires more _a_r_g_u_-
              _m_e_n_t_s than are supplied, the extra format  specifi-
              cations  behave  as if a zero value or null string,
              as appropriate,  had  been  supplied.   The  return
              value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.

              Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack,
              or rotates the stack, making the  new  top  of  the

              ments,  exchanges  the  top  two  directories   and
              returns  0,  unless  the  directory stack is empty.
              Arguments, if supplied, have  the  following  mean-
              ings:

                     (counting from the left of the list shown by
                     ddiirrss, starting with zero) is at the top.

                     by  ddiirrss, starting with zero) is at the top.
              --nn     Suppresses the normal  change  of  directory
                     when  adding  directories  to  the stack, so
                     that only the stack is manipulated.
              _d_i_r    Adds _d_i_r to the directory stack at the  top,
                     making it the new current working directory.

              If the ppuusshhdd command is successful, a ddiirrss is  per-
              formed  as  well.  If the first form is used, ppuusshhdd
              returns 0 unless the cd to  _d_i_r  fails.   With  the
              second  form,  ppuusshhdd returns 0 unless the directory
              stack is empty, a non-existent directory stack ele-
              ment  is  specified, or the directory change to the

              remove  any  special meaning for the next character
              read and for line continuation.  Options,  if  sup-
              plied, have the following meanings:

              --aa _a_n_a_m_e
                     The words are assigned to sequential indices
                     of the array variable _a_n_a_m_e, starting at  0.
                     _a_n_a_m_e  is  unset  before  any new values are
                     assigned.  Other _n_a_m_e arguments are ignored.
              --dd _d_e_l_i_m
                     The first character of _d_e_l_i_m is used to ter-
                     minate the input line, rather than  newline.
              --ee     If  the standard input is coming from a ter-
                     minal, rreeaaddlliinnee (see RREEAADDLLIINNEE above) is used
                     to obtain the line.

                     rreeaadd returns after reading _n_c_h_a_r_s characters
                     rather than waiting for a complete  line  of
                     input.
              --pp _p_r_o_m_p_t
                     Display  _p_r_o_m_p_t on standard error, without a
                     trailing newline, before attempting to  read
                     any  input.  The prompt is displayed only if
                     input is coming from a terminal.
              --rr     Backslash does not act as an escape  charac-
                     ter.  The backslash is considered to be part
                     of the line.  In  particular,  a  backslash-
                     newline  pair may not be used as a line con-
                     tinuation.
              --ss     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a ter-

                     Cause rreeaadd to time out and return failure if
                     a complete line of input is not read  within
                     _t_i_m_e_o_u_t  seconds.  This option has no effect
                     if rreeaadd is not reading input from the termi-
                     nal or a pipe.

              If no _n_a_m_e_s are supplied, the line read is assigned
              to the variable RREEPPLLYY.  The return  code  is  zero,
              unless  end-of-file  is  encountered  or rreeaadd times

       rreeaaddoonnllyy [--aappff] [_n_a_m_e ...]
              The given _n_a_m_e_s are marked readonly; the values  of
              these  _n_a_m_e_s  may  not  be  changed  by  subsequent
              assignment.  If the  --ff  option  is  supplied,  the
              functions corresponding to the _n_a_m_e_s are so marked.
              The --aa option restricts the  variables  to  arrays.
              If no _n_a_m_e arguments are given, or if the --pp option
              is supplied,  a  list  of  all  readonly  names  is
              printed.   The  --pp  option causes output to be dis-
              played in a format that may  be  reused  as  input.
              The  return status is 0 unless an invalid option is
              encountered, one of the _n_a_m_e_s is not a valid  shell
              variable  name,  or --ff is supplied with a _n_a_m_e that

              Without options, the name and value of  each  shell
              variable  are  displayed  in  a  format that can be
              reused as input.  The output is sorted according to
              the  current  locale.   When options are specified,
              they set or unset shell attributes.  Any  arguments
              remaining  after  the  options  are  processed  are
              treated as values for the positional parameters and
              are  assigned,  in  order,  to  $$11,  $$22,  ......   $$_n.

                      only when job control is enabled.

              --HH      Enable !!  style history substitution.  This
                      option is on by default when the  shell  is
                      interactive.
              --PP      If  set, the shell does not follow symbolic
                      links when executing commands  such  as  ccdd
                      that  change the current working directory.
                      It uses the  physical  directory  structure
                      instead.  By default, bbaasshh follows the log-
                      ical chain of directories  when  performing
                      commands  which  change  the current direc-

                      positional  parameters.   The  --xx  and   --vv
                      options  are  turned  off.  If there are no
                      _a_r_gs,  the  positional  parameters   remain
                      unchanged.

              The  options  are  off  by default unless otherwise
              noted.  Using + rather than - causes these  options
              to  be  turned off.  The options can also be speci-
              fied as arguments to an invocation  of  the  shell.
              The current set of options may be found in $$--.  The
              return status is  always  true  unless  an  invalid
              option is encountered.

       sshhiifftt [_n]
              The  positional parameters from _n+1 ... are renamed
              to $$11 ........  Parameters represented by  the  numbers
              $$## down to $$##-_n+1 are unset.  _n must be a non-nega-
              tive number less than or equal to $$##.  If _n  is  0,
              no  parameters  are changed.  If _n is not given, it
              is assumed to be 1.  If _n is greater than  $$##,  the
              positional  parameters are not changed.  The return
              status is greater than zero if _n is greater than $$##
              or less than zero; otherwise 0.

       sshhoopptt [--ppqqssuu] [--oo] [_o_p_t_n_a_m_e ...]
              Toggle the values of variables controlling optional
              shell behavior.  With no options, or  with  the  --pp
              option,  a  list  of  all  settable options is dis-
              played, with an indication of whether or  not  each
              is  set.   The  --pp  option causes output to be dis-
              played in a form  that  may  be  reused  as  input.
              Other options have the following meanings:
              --ss     Enable (set) each _o_p_t_n_a_m_e.
              --uu     Disable (unset) each _o_p_t_n_a_m_e.
              --qq     Suppresses  normal  output (quiet mode); the
                     return status indicates whether the  _o_p_t_n_a_m_e
                     is  set or unset.  If multiple _o_p_t_n_a_m_e argu-
                     ments are given with --qq, the  return  status
                     is  zero  if  all _o_p_t_n_a_m_e_s are enabled; non-
                     zero otherwise.
              --oo     Restricts the values of _o_p_t_n_a_m_e to be  those
                     defined   for  the  --oo  option  to  the  sseett
                     builtin.

              If either --ss or --uu is used with  no  _o_p_t_n_a_m_e  argu-
              ments,  the  display  is  limited  to those options
              which are set or unset, respectively.  Unless  oth-
              erwise   noted,  the  sshhoopptt  options  are  disabled
              (unset) by default.

              The return status when listing options is  zero  if
              all _o_p_t_n_a_m_e_s are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When
              setting or unsetting options, the return status  is
              zero unless an _o_p_t_n_a_m_e is not a valid shell option.

              ccddaabbllee__vvaarrss
                      If set, an argument to the ccdd builtin  com-
                      mand  that is not a directory is assumed to
                      be the name of a variable  whose  value  is
                      the directory to change to.
              ccddssppeellll If  set,  minor errors in the spelling of a
                      directory component in a ccdd command will be
                      corrected.   The  errors  checked  for  are
                      transposed characters, a missing character,
                      and  one  character too many.  If a correc-
                      tion is found, the corrected file  name  is
                      printed,  and  the  command proceeds.  This
                      option is only used by interactive  shells.
              cchheecckkhhaasshh
                      If set, bbaasshh checks that a command found in
                      the hash table exists before trying to exe-
                      cute  it.   If  a  hashed command no longer
                      exists, a normal path search is  performed.
              cchheecckkwwiinnssiizzee
                      If  set,  bbaasshh checks the window size after
                      each command and, if necessary, updates the
                      values of LLIINNEESS and CCOOLLUUMMNNSS.
              ccmmddhhiisstt If  set, bbaasshh attempts to save all lines of
                      a multiple-line command in the same history
                      entry.   This  allows  easy  re-editing  of
                      multi-line commands.
              ddoottgglloobb If set, bbaasshh includes  filenames  beginning
                      with  a  `.'  in  the  results  of pathname
                      expansion.
              eexxeeccffaaiill
                      If set, a non-interactive  shell  will  not
                      exit  if  it cannot execute the file speci-
                      fied as an argument  to  the  eexxeecc  builtin
                      command.   An  interactive  shell  does not
                      exit if eexxeecc fails.
              eexxppaanndd__aalliiaasseess
                      If set, aliases are expanded  as  described
                      above   under   AALLIIAASSEESS.   This  option  is
                      enabled by default for interactive  shells.
              eexxttgglloobb If  set, the extended pattern matching fea-
                      tures described above under PPaatthhnnaammee EExxppaann--
                      ssiioonn are enabled.
              hhiissttaappppeenndd
                      If set, the history list is appended to the
                      file named by the  value  of  the  HHIISSTTFFIILLEE
                      variable  when the shell exits, rather than
                      overwriting the file.
              hhiissttrreeeeddiitt
                      If set, and rreeaaddlliinnee is being used, a  user
                      is  given  the  opportunity  to  re-edit  a

                      If set, and rreeaaddlliinnee  is  being  used,  the
                      results  of  history  substitution  are not
                      immediately passed  to  the  shell  parser.
                      Instead,  the resulting line is loaded into
                      the rreeaaddlliinnee editing buffer, allowing  fur-
                      ther modification.

              iinntteerraaccttiivvee__ccoommmmeennttss
                      If set, allow a word beginning  with  ##  to
                      cause  that  word and all remaining charac-
                      ters on that  line  to  be  ignored  in  an
                      interactive  shell  (see  CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS  above).
                      This option is enabled by default.
              lliitthhiisstt If set, and the ccmmddhhiisstt option is  enabled,
                      multi-line  commands  are saved to the his-
                      tory with  embedded  newlines  rather  than
                      using  semicolon separators where possible.
              llooggiinn__sshheellll
                      The shell sets this option if it is started
                      as  a  login  shell (see IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN above).
                      The value may not be changed.

                      This  is  not  reset when the startup files
                      are executed, allowing the startup files to

              ssoouurrcceeppaatthh
                      If set, the ssoouurrccee  (..)  builtin  uses  the
                      value  of  PPAATTHH  to find the directory con-

              tteesstt and [[ evaluate conditional expressions using a
              set of rules based on the number of arguments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and  only  if  the
                     argument is not null.
              2 arguments
                     If  the  first argument is !!, the expression
                     is true if and only if the  second  argument
                     is  null.   If  the first argument is one of
                     the unary conditional operators listed above
                     under  CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL  EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS, the expres-
                     sion is true if the unary test is true.   If
                     the first argument is not a valid unary con-
                     ditional operator, the expression is  false.
              3 arguments
                     If  the second argument is one of the binary
                     conditional  operators  listed  above  under
                     CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL  EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS,  the result of the
                     expression is the result of the binary  test
                     using  the  first  and  third  arguments  as
                     operands.  If the first argument is  !!,  the
                     value  is  the  negation of the two-argument
                     test using the second and  third  arguments.
                     If  the  first argument is exactly (( and the
                     third argument is exactly )), the  result  is
                     the  one-argument  test  of the second argu-
                     ment.  Otherwise, the expression  is  false.
                     The  --aa  and  --oo  operators  are  considered
                     binary operators in this case.
              4 arguments
                     If the first argument is !!,  the  result  is
                     the  negation  of the three-argument expres-
                     sion composed of  the  remaining  arguments.
                     Otherwise,  the  expression  is  parsed  and
                     evaluated according to precedence using  the
                     rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The   expression  is  parsed  and  evaluated
                     according  to  precedence  using  the  rules
                     listed above.

              The command _a_r_g is to be read and executed when the

              signal specified by each _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is ignored by  the
              shell  and  by  the commands it invokes.  If _a_r_g is
              not present and --pp has been supplied, then the trap
              commands  associated  with  each  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  are dis-
              played.  If no arguments are supplied or if only --pp
              is  given, ttrraapp prints the list of commands associ-
              ated with each  signal  number.   Each  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  is
              either  a  signal  name defined in <_s_i_g_n_a_l_._h>, or a
              signal number.  If a _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is EEXXIITT (0)  the  com-
              mand  _a_r_g is executed on exit from the shell.  If a
              _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is DDEEBBUUGG, the command _a_r_g is executed after
              every _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d (see SSHHEELLLL GGRRAAMMMMAARR above).  If
              a _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is EERRRR, the command _a_r_g is executed when-
              ever  a  simple command has a non-zero exit status.
              The EERRRR trap is not executed if the failed  command
              is  part  of  an _u_n_t_i_l or _w_h_i_l_e loop, part of an _i_f
              statement, part of a &&&& or |||| list, or if the  com-
              mand's  return  value is being inverted via !!.  The
              --ll option causes the shell to print a list of  sig-
              nal names and their corresponding numbers.  Signals
              ignored upon entry to the shell cannot  be  trapped
              or reset.  Trapped signals are reset to their orig-
              inal values in a child process when it is  created.
              The  return  status  is  false  if  any  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is
              invalid; otherwise ttrraapp returns true.

       ttyyppee [--aattpp] _n_a_m_e [_n_a_m_e ...]
              With no options, indicate how each  _n_a_m_e  would  be
              interpreted  if  used as a command name.  If the --tt
              option is used, ttyyppee prints a string which  is  one
              of  _a_l_i_a_s,  _k_e_y_w_o_r_d,  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n, _b_u_i_l_t_i_n, or _f_i_l_e if
              _n_a_m_e is an alias, shell  reserved  word,  function,
              builtin,  or  disk file, respectively.  If the _n_a_m_e
              is not found, then nothing is printed, and an  exit
              status  of  false is returned.  If the --pp option is
              used, ttyyppee either returns the name of the disk file
              that  would be executed if _n_a_m_e were specified as a
              command name, or nothing if ``type -t name''  would
              not return _f_i_l_e.  If a command is hashed, --pp prints
              the hashed value, not  necessarily  the  file  that
              appears  first  in PPAATTHH.  If the --aa option is used,
              ttyyppee prints all of the places that contain an  exe-
              cutable  named  _n_a_m_e.   This  includes  aliases and
              functions, if and only if the --pp option is not also
              used.   The  table  of  hashed commands is not con-
              sulted when using --aa.  ttyyppee returns true if any  of
              the arguments are found, false if none are found.

              increased once it is  set;  a  soft  limit  may  be
              increased  up  to  the value of the hard limit.  If
              neither --HH nor --SS is specified, both the  soft  and
              hard  limits  are set.  The value of _l_i_m_i_t can be a
              number in the unit specified for  the  resource  or
              one of the special values hhaarrdd, ssoofftt, or uunnlliimmiitteedd,
              which stand for the current hard limit, the current
              soft  limit,  and no limit, respectively.  If _l_i_m_i_t
              is omitted, the current value of the soft limit  of
              the  resource  is  printed, unless the --HH option is
              given.  When more than one resource  is  specified,
              the  limit  name  and  unit  are printed before the
              value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
              --aa     All current limits are reported
              --cc     The maximum size of core files created
              --dd     The maximum size of a process's data segment
              --ff     The  maximum  size  of  files created by the

              --mm     The maximum resident set size
              --nn     The  maximum number of open file descriptors
                     (most systems do not allow this value to  be
                     set)
              --pp     The  pipe  size in 512-byte blocks (this may
                     not be set)

              --uu     The maximum number of processes available to
                     a single user

                     able to the shell

              If _l_i_m_i_t is given, it is the new value of the spec-
              ified resource (the --aa option is display only).  If
              no option is given, then --ff is assumed.  Values are
              in 1024-byte increments, except for --tt, which is in
              seconds, --pp, which is in units of 512-byte  blocks,
              and  --nn  and  --uu,  which  are unscaled values.  The
              return status is 0  unless  an  invalid  option  or
              argument is supplied, or an error occurs while set-
              ting a new limit.

       uummaasskk [--pp] [--SS] [_m_o_d_e]
              The user file-creation mask is  set  to  _m_o_d_e.   If
              _m_o_d_e  begins  with a digit, it is interpreted as an
              octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a sym-
              bolic   mode  mask  similar  to  that  accepted  by
              _c_h_m_o_d(1).  If _m_o_d_e is omitted, the current value of
              the mask is printed.  The --SS option causes the mask
              to be printed in symbolic form; the default  output
              is  an octal number.  If the --pp option is supplied,
              and _m_o_d_e is omitted, the output is in a  form  that

              option is given, each _n_a_m_e refers to a shell  vari-

              is specifed, each _n_a_m_e refers to a shell  function,
              and the function definition is removed.  Each unset
