       BBaasshh is an sshh-compatible command language interpreter that
       executes  commands  read from the standard input or from a
       file.  BBaasshh also incorporates  useful  features  from  the
       _K_o_r_n and _C shells (kksshh and ccsshh).

       BBaasshh  is intended to be a conformant implementation of the
       IEEE POSIX Shell and  Tools  specification  (IEEE  Working
       Group 1003.2).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       In  addition  to  the single-character shell options docu-
       mented in the description of the sseett builtin command, bbaasshh
       interprets the following options when it is invoked:

       --cc _s_t_r_i_n_g If  the  --cc option is present, then commands are
                 read from _s_t_r_i_n_g.  If there are arguments  after
                 the  _s_t_r_i_n_g, they are assigned to the positional
                 parameters, starting with $$00.
       --rr        If the --rr option is present, the  shell  becomes
                 _r_e_s_t_r_i_c_t_e_d (see RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL below).
       --ii        If the --ii option is present, the shell is _i_n_t_e_r_-
                 _a_c_t_i_v_e.
       --ss        If the --ss option is present, or if no  arguments
                 remain  after  option  processing, then commands
                 are read from the standard input.   This  option
                 allows  the positional parameters to be set when
                 invoking an interactive shell.
       --DD        A list of all double-quoted strings preceded  by
                 $$  is  printed on the standard ouput.  These are
                 the strings that are subject to language  trans-
                 lation  when  the  current  locale  is  not CC or
                 PPOOSSIIXX.  This implies the --nn option; no  commands
                 will be executed.
       [[--++]]OO [[_s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n]]
                 _s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n   is   one  of  the  shell  options
                 accepted by the sshhoopptt builtin (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN
                 CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  If _s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n is present, --OO
                 sets the value of that option; ++OO unsets it.  If
                 _s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n is not supplied, the names and val-
                 ues of the shell options accepted by  sshhoopptt  are
                 printed  on the standard output.  If the invoca-
                 tion option is ++OO, the output is displayed in  a
                 format that may be reused as input.

       ----        A  ----  signals  the  end of options and disables
                 further option processing.  Any arguments  after
                 the  ----  are treated as filenames and arguments.
                 An argument of -- is equivalent to ----.

       BBaasshh also interprets a number of multi-character  options.
       These  options  must appear on the command line before the
       single-character options in order for them  to  be  recog-
       nized.

       ----dduummpp--ppoo--ssttrriinnggss
              Equivalent to --DD, but the output is in the GNU _g_e_t_-
              _t_e_x_t ppoo (portable object) file format.
       ----dduummpp--ssttrriinnggss

       ----rrccffiillee _f_i_l_e
              Execute  commands from _f_i_l_e instead of the standard
              personal initialization file _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c if the shell
              is interactive (see IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN below).

       ----llooggiinn
              Make  bbaasshh act as if it had been invoked as a login
              shell (see IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN below).

       ----nnooeeddiittiinngg
              Do not use the GNU rreeaaddlliinnee library to read command
              lines when the shell is interactive.

       ----nnoopprrooffiillee
              Do  not  read  either  the system-wide startup file
              _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e or any of the personal  initialization
              files  _~_/_._b_a_s_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e,  _~_/_._b_a_s_h___l_o_g_i_n,  or _~_/_._p_r_o_-
              _f_i_l_e.  By default, bbaasshh reads these files  when  it
              is invoked as a login shell (see IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN below).

       ----nnoorrcc Do not read and execute the personal initialization
              file  _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c  if the shell is interactive.  This
              option is on by default if the shell is invoked  as
              sshh.

       ----ppoossiixx
              Change the behavior of bbaasshh where the default oper-
              ation differs from the  POSIX  1003.2  standard  to
              match the standard (_p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e).

       ----rreessttrriicctteedd
              The  shell becomes restricted (see RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL
              below).

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Show version information for this instance of  bbaasshh

       If  arguments  remain after option processing, and neither
       the --cc nor the --ss option  has  been  supplied,  the  first
       argument  is  assumed  to be the name of a file containing
       shell commands.  If bbaasshh is invoked in this fashion, $$00 is
       set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters
       are set to the remaining arguments.  BBaasshh reads  and  exe-
       cutes  commands  from  this file, then exits.  BBaasshh's exit
       status is the exit status of the last command executed  in
       the  script.  If no commands are executed, the exit status
       is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the  file  in  the
       current  directory,  and,  if  no  file is found, then the
       shell searches the directories in PPAATTHH for the script.

IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN
       A _l_o_g_i_n _s_h_e_l_l is one whose  first  character  of  argument
       zero is a --, or one started with the ----llooggiinn option.

       An  _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e  shell  is  one started without non-option
       arguments and without the --cc option whose  standard  input
       and  output are both connected to terminals (as determined
       by _i_s_a_t_t_y(3)), or one started with the --ii option.  PPSS11  is
       set  and  $$-- includes ii if bbaasshh is interactive, allowing a
       shell script or a startup file to test this state.

       The following paragraphs describe how  bbaasshh  executes  its
       startup  files.   If  any of the files exist but cannot be
       read, bbaasshh reports an error.  Tildes are expanded in  file
       names  as  described  below  under  TTiillddee EExxppaannssiioonn in the
       EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN section.

       When bbaasshh is invoked as an interactive login shell, or  as
       a  non-interactive shell with the ----llooggiinn option, it first
       reads and executes commands from the file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e, if
       that  file  exists.  After reading that file, it looks for
       _~_/_._b_a_s_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e, _~_/_._b_a_s_h___l_o_g_i_n, and  _~_/_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e,  in  that
       order,  and reads and executes commands from the first one
       that exists and is readable.  The ----nnoopprrooffiillee  option  may
       be  used  when the shell is started to inhibit this behav-
       ior.

       When a login shell exits, bbaasshh reads and executes commands
       from the file _~_/_._b_a_s_h___l_o_g_o_u_t, if it exists.

       When  an  interactive  shell  that is not a login shell is
       started, bbaasshh reads and executes commands from  _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c,
       if  that  file exists.  This may be inhibited by using the
       ----nnoorrcc option.  The ----rrccffiillee _f_i_l_e option will  force  bbaasshh
       to   read  and  execute  commands  from  _f_i_l_e  instead  of
       _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c.

BASH(1)                                                   BASH(1)


       When bbaasshh is started non-interactively,  to  run  a  shell
       script, for example, it looks for the variable BBAASSHH__EENNVV in
       the environment, expands its value if  it  appears  there,
       and  uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read
       and execute.  BBaasshh behaves as  if  the  following  command
       were executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but  the  value of the PPAATTHH variable is not used to search
       for the file name.

       If bbaasshh is invoked with the name sshh, it tries to mimic the
       startup  behavior  of historical versions of sshh as closely
       as possible, while conforming to  the  POSIX  standard  as
       well.   When  invoked  as an interactive login shell, or a
       non-interactive shell with the ----llooggiinn  option,  it  first
       attempts  to  read  and execute commands from _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e
       and _~_/_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, in that order.  The ----nnoopprrooffiillee option may
       be  used  to  inhibit  this  behavior.  When invoked as an
       interactive shell with the name sshh,  bbaasshh  looks  for  the
       variable EENNVV, expands its value if it is defined, and uses
       the expanded value as the name of a file to read and  exe-
       cute.   Since  a  shell  invoked as sshh does not attempt to
       read and execute commands from any  other  startup  files,
       the  ----rrccffiillee  option  has  no  effect.  A non-interactive
       shell invoked with the name sshh does not  attempt  to  read
       any  other startup files.  When invoked as sshh, bbaasshh enters
       _p_o_s_i_x mode after the startup files are read.

       When bbaasshh is started in _p_o_s_i_x mode, as  with  the  ----ppoossiixx
       command  line  option,  it  follows the POSIX standard for
       startup files.  In this mode,  interactive  shells  expand
       the  EENNVV  variable and commands are read and executed from
       the file whose name  is  the  expanded  value.   No  other
       startup files are read.

       BBaasshh  attempts  to  determine  when it is being run by the
       remote shell daemon, usually _r_s_h_d.  If bbaasshh determines  it
       is  being run by _r_s_h_d, it reads and executes commands from
       _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c, if that file exists and is readable.   It  will
       not  do  this  if invoked as sshh.  The ----nnoorrcc option may be
       used to inhibit this behavior, and the ----rrccffiillee option may
       be  used  to  force another file to be read, but _r_s_h_d does
       not generally invoke the shell with those options or allow
       them to be specified.

       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id
       not equal to the real user (group) id, and the  --pp  option
       is  not  supplied,  no startup files are read, shell func-
       tions are not inherited from the  environment,  the  SSHHEELL--
       LLOOPPTTSS  variable,  if  it  appears  in  the environment, is
       ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user
       id.   If  the  --pp  option  is  supplied at invocation, the
       startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is
       not reset.

   PPiippeelliinneess
       A _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e is a sequence of one or more commands separated
       by the character ||.  The format for a pipeline is:

              [ttiimmee [--pp]] [ ! ] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [ || _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2 ... ]

       The standard output of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is connected via a pipe  to
       the  standard  input of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2.  This connection is per-
       formed before any redirections specified  by  the  command
       (see RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN below).

       If the reserved word !!  precedes a pipeline, the exit sta-
       tus of that pipeline is the logical NOT of the exit status

       of  the  last  command.   Otherwise,  the  status  of  the
       pipeline is the exit status  of  the  last  command.   The
       shell  waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate
       before returning a value.

       If the ttiimmee reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed
       as  well as user and system time consumed by its execution
       are reported when the pipeline terminates.  The --pp  option
       changes the output format to that specified by POSIX.  The
       TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT variable may be set to  a  format  string  that
       specifies  how the timing information should be displayed;
       see the description of TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT  under  SShheellll  VVaarriiaabblleess
       below.

       Each  command in a pipeline is executed as a separate pro-
       cess (i.e., in a subshell).

   LLiissttss
       A _l_i_s_t is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by
       one  of the operators ;;, &&, &&&&, or ||||, and optionally ter-
       minated by one of ;;, &&, or <<nneewwlliinnee>>.

       Of these list operators, &&&& and |||| have equal  precedence,
       followed by ;; and &&,, which have equal precedence.

       If  a command is terminated by the control operator &&, the
       shell executes the command in the  _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d  in  a  sub-
       shell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish,
       and the return status is 0.  Commands separated by a ;; are
       executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to
       terminate in turn.  The return status is the  exit  status
       of the last command executed.

       The  control  operators  &&&& and |||| denote AND lists and OR
       lists, respectively.  An AND list has the form

              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 &&&& _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2

       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2 is executed if, and only if, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 returns  an
       exit status of zero.

       An OR list has the form

              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 |||| _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2


       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2  is  executed  if  and only if _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 returns a
       non-zero exit status.  The return status  of  AND  and  OR
       lists  is  the exit status of the last command executed in
       the list.

       (_l_i_s_t) _l_i_s_t is executed in a subshell.   Variable  assign-
              ments  and builtin commands that affect the shell's
              environment do not remain in effect after the  com-
              mand completes.  The return status is the exit sta-
              tus of _l_i_s_t.

       { _l_i_s_t; }
              _l_i_s_t is simply executed in the current shell  envi-
              ronment.  _l_i_s_t must be terminated with a newline or
              semicolon.  This is known as a _g_r_o_u_p _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.   The
              return  status  is  the  exit status of _l_i_s_t.  Note
              that unlike the metacharacters (( and , {{ and }}  are
              _r_e_s_e_r_v_e_d _w_o_r_d_s and must occur where a reserved word
              is permitted to be recognized.  Since they  do  not
              cause  a  word  break,  they must be separated from
              _l_i_s_t by whitespace.

       ((_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n))
              The _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is evaluated according to the  rules
              described  below  under  AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN.  If
              the value of the expression is non-zero, the return
              status  is  0;  otherwise  the  return status is 1.
              This is exactly equivalent to lleett ""_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n"".

       [[[[ _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ]]]]
              Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the  evalua-
              tion  of  the  conditional  expression  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.
              Expressions are composed of the primaries described
              below  under  CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS.  Word split-
              ting and pathname expansion are  not  performed  on
              the  words  between the [[[[ and ]]]]; tilde expansion,
              parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expan-
              sion,  command  substitution, process substitution,
              and quote removal are performed.

              When the ==== and !!== operators are used,  the  string
              to  the  right of the operator is considered a pat-
              tern and matched according to the  rules  described
              below  under PPaatttteerrnn MMaattcchhiinngg.  The return value is
              0 if the string matches or does not match the  pat-
              tern,  respectively,  and 1 otherwise.  Any part of
              the pattern may be quoted to force it to be matched
              as a string.

              Expressions  may  be  combined  using the following
              operators, listed in  decreasing  order  of  prece-
              dence:

              (( _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ))
                     Returns  the  value of _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  This may
                     be used to override the normal precedence of
                     operators.
              !! _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
                     True if _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is false.

              The list of words following iinn is expanded,  gener-
              ating a list of items.  The variable _n_a_m_e is set to
              each element of this list in turn, and _l_i_s_t is exe-
              cuted  each  time.   If the iinn _w_o_r_d is omitted, the

              parameter  that is set (see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS below).  The
              return status is the exit status of the  last  com-
              mand  that executes.  If the expansion of the items
              following iinn results in an empty list, no  commands

              First, the arithmetic expression _e_x_p_r_1 is evaluated
              according to the rules described below under AARRIITTHH--
              MMEETTIICC  EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN.  The arithmetic expression _e_x_p_r_2
              is then evaluated repeatedly until it evaluates  to
              zero.   Each  time  _e_x_p_r_2  evaluates  to a non-zero
              value, _l_i_s_t is executed and the arithmetic  expres-
              sion  _e_x_p_r_3  is  evaluated.   If  any expression is
              omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to  1.   The
              return value is the exit status of the last command

              The  list of words following iinn is expanded, gener-
              ating a list of items.  The set of  expanded  words
              is  printed on the standard error, each preceded by
              a number.  If the iinn _w_o_r_d  is  omitted,  the  posi-
              tional   parameters  are  printed  (see  PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS
              below).  The PPSS33 prompt is  then  displayed  and  a
              line  read  from  the  standard input.  If the line
              consists of a number corresponding to  one  of  the
              displayed  words,  then the value of _n_a_m_e is set to
              that word.  If the line is  empty,  the  words  and
              prompt  are  displayed  again.  If EOF is read, the

       allow  comments.  The iinntteerraaccttiivvee__ccoommmmeennttss option is on by
       default in interactive shells.

QQUUOOTTIINNGG
       _Q_u_o_t_i_n_g is used to remove the special meaning  of  certain
       characters  or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to
       disable special treatment for special characters, to  pre-
       vent  reserved words from being recognized as such, and to
       prevent parameter expansion.

       Each of the _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s listed above under  DDEEFFIINNIITTIIOONNSS
       has  special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it
       is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion  facilities  are  being
       used,  the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n character, usually !!, must be
       quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are three quoting mechanisms: the _e_s_c_a_p_e  _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r,
       single quotes, and double quotes.

       A  non-quoted  backslash  (\\) is the _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r.  It
       preserves the literal value of  the  next  character  that
       follows, with the exception of <newline>.  If a \\<newline>
       pair appears, and the backslash is not itself quoted,  the
       \\<newline>  is treated as a line continuation (that is, it
       is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing  characters  in single quotes preserves the lit-
       eral value of each character within the quotes.  A  single
       quote  may not occur between single quotes, even when pre-
       ceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves  the  lit-
       eral  value  of all characters within the quotes, with the
       exception of $$, ``, and \\.  The characters $$ and  ``  retain
       their special meaning within double quotes.  The backslash
       retains its special meaning only when followed by  one  of
       the  following  characters:  $$,  ``, "", \\, or <<nneewwlliinnee>>.  A
       double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preced-
       ing it with a backslash.

       The  special  parameters ** and @@ have special meaning when
       in double quotes (see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS below).

       Words of the form $$'_s_t_r_i_n_g' are  treated  specially.   The
       word  expands to _s_t_r_i_n_g, with backslash-escaped characters
       replaced as specifed by the ANSI  C  standard.   Backslash
       escape sequences, if present, are decoded as follows:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\ee     an escape character
              \\ff     form feed
              \\nn     new line

              \\''     single quote
              \\_n_n_n   the  eight-bit  character whose value is the
                     octal value _n_n_n (one to three digits)
              \\xx_H_H   the eight-bit character whose value  is  the
                     hexadecimal value _H_H (one or two hex digits)

       The expanded result is single-quoted,  as  if  the  dollar
       sign had not been present.

       A  double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign ($$) will
       cause the string to be translated according to the current
       locale.   If  the current locale is CC or PPOOSSIIXX, the dollar
       sign  is  ignored.   If  the  string  is  translated   and
       replaced, the replacement is double-quoted.

PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS
       A  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an entity that stores values.  It can be a
       _n_a_m_e, a number, or one of the  special  characters  listed
       below under SSppeecciiaall PPaarraammeetteerrss.  For the shell's purposes,
       a _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e is a parameter denoted by a _n_a_m_e.   A  variable
       has  a  _v_a_l_u_e and zero or more _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s.  Attributes are
       assigned using the ddeeccllaarree builtin  command  (see  ddeeccllaarree
       below in SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS).

       A  parameter  is set if it has been assigned a value.  The
       null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set,  it
       may  be unset only by using the uunnsseett builtin command (see
       SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       A _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e may be assigned to by a statement of the form

              _n_a_m_e=[_v_a_l_u_e]

       If _v_a_l_u_e is not given, the variable is assigned  the  null
       string.  All _v_a_l_u_e_s undergo tilde expansion, parameter and
       variable  expansion,  command   substitution,   arithmetic
       expansion,  and  quote  removal (see EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN below).  If
       the variable has its iinntteeggeerr attribute set, then _v_a_l_u_e  is
       subject  to  arithmetic  expansion  even  if  the $((...))
       expansion is not used (see  AArriitthhmmeettiicc  EExxppaannssiioonn  below).
       Word  splitting  is  not  performed, with the exception of
       ""$$@@"" as explained below under SSppeecciiaall  PPaarraammeetteerrss.   Path-
       name  expansion  is  not performed.  Assignment statements
       may also appear as  arguments  to  the  ddeeccllaarree,  ttyyppeesseett,
       eexxppoorrtt, rreeaaddoonnllyy, and llooccaall builtin commands.

       more digits, other than the single  digit  0.   Positional
       parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it

       is invoked, and may be reassigned using  the  sseett  builtin
       command.   Positional  parameters  may  not be assigned to
       with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are
       temporarily  replaced  when  a  shell function is executed
       (see FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS below).

       When a positional parameter consisting of more than a sin-
       gle  digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see
       EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN below).

   SSppeecciiaall PPaarraammeetteerrss
       The shell  treats  several  parameters  specially.   These
       parameters  may  only be referenced; assignment to them is
       not allowed.
       **      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from
              one.   When  the  expansion  occurs  within  double
              quotes, it expands to a single word with the  value
              of  each parameter separated by the first character
              of the IIFFSS special  variable.   That  is,  "$$**"  is
              equivalent  to  "$$11_c$$22_c......",  where  _c is the first
              character of the value of the IIFFSS variable.  If IIFFSS
              is  unset,  the parameters are separated by spaces.
              If IIFFSS is null, the parameters are  joined  without
              intervening separators.
       @@      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from
              one.   When  the  expansion  occurs  within  double
              quotes,  each parameter expands to a separate word.
              That is, "$$@@" is equivalent to "$$11" "$$22" ...   When
              there  are  no  positional  parameters, "$$@@" and $$@@
              expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).
       ##      Expands to the number of positional  parameters  in
              decimal.
       ??      Expands to the status of the most recently executed
              foreground pipeline.
       --      Expands to the current option  flags  as  specified
              upon  invocation,  by  the  sseett builtin command, or
              those set by the  shell  itself  (such  as  the  --ii
              option).
       $$      Expands  to  the  process ID of the shell.  In a ()
              subshell, it expands to the process ID of the  cur-
              rent shell, not the subshell.
       !!      Expands to the process ID of the most recently exe-
              cuted background (asynchronous) command.
       00      Expands to the name of the shell or  shell  script.
              This  is  set  at shell initialization.  If bbaasshh is
              invoked with a file of commands, $$00 is set  to  the
              name  of that file.  If bbaasshh is started with the --cc
              option, then $$00 is set to the first argument  after
              the string to be executed, if one is present.  Oth-
              erwise, it is set to the file name used  to  invoke
              bbaasshh, as given by argument zero.
       __      At  shell startup, set to the absolute file name of
              the shell or shell script being executed as  passed
              in the argument list.  Subsequently, expands to the

              last argument to the previous command, after expan-
              sion.   Also set to the full file name of each com-
              mand  executed  and  placed  in   the   environment
              exported to that command.  When checking mail, this
              parameter holds the name of the mail file currently
              being checked.

   SShheellll VVaarriiaabblleess
       The following variables are set by the shell:

       BBAASSHH   Expands  to  the full file name used to invoke this

       BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO
              A readonly array variable whose members  hold  ver-
              sion  information  for  this instance of bbaasshh.  The
              values assigned to the array members  are  as  fol-

              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[1]]        The  minor  version  number
                                      (the _v_e_r_s_i_o_n).
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[2]]        The patch level.
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[3]]        The build version.
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[4]]        The  release  status (e.g.,
                                      _b_e_t_a_1).
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[5]]        The value of MMAACCHHTTYYPPEE.

       BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIIOONN
              Expands to a string describing the version of  this
              instance of bbaasshh.

       CCOOMMPP__CCWWOORRDD
              An  index into $${{CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDSS}} of the word containing
              the current  cursor  position.   This  variable  is
              available  only  in  shell functions invoked by the
              programmable  completion   facilities   (see   PPrroo--

       CCOOMMPP__LLIINNEE
              The  current command line.  This variable is avail-
              able only in shell functions and external  commands
              invoked  by  the programmable completion facilities
              (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).

       CCOOMMPP__PPOOIINNTT
              The index of the current cursor  position  relative
              to  the  beginning  of the current command.  If the
              current cursor position is at the end of  the  cur-
              rent  command,  the value of this variable is equal
              to $${{##CCOOMMPP__LLIINNEE}}.  This variable is available  only
              in shell functions and external commands invoked by

       CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDSS
              An  array variable (see AArrrraayyss below) consisting of
              the individual words in the current  command  line.
              This  variable is available only in shell functions
              invoked by the programmable  completion  facilities
              (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).

       DDIIRRSSTTAACCKK
              An array variable (see AArrrraayyss below) containing the
              current contents of the directory stack.   Directo-
              ries appear in the stack in the order they are dis-
              played by the ddiirrss builtin.  Assigning  to  members
              of this array variable may be used to modify direc-
              tories already in the stack, but the ppuusshhdd and ppooppdd
              builtins  must  be  used to add and remove directo-
              ries.  Assignment to this variable will not  change
              the  current  directory.   If DDIIRRSSTTAACCKK is unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is  subse-
              quently reset.

       EEUUIIDD   Expands  to  the  effective  user ID of the current
              user, initialized at shell startup.  This  variable
              is readonly.

       FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE
              The name of any currently-executing shell function.
              This variable exists only when a shell function  is
              executing.   Assignments to FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE have no effect
              and return an error status.  If FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE is  unset,
              it loses its special properties, even if it is sub-
              sequently reset.

       GGRROOUUPPSS An array variable containing the list of groups  of
              which the current user is a member.  Assignments to
              GGRROOUUPPSS have no effect and return an  error  status.
              If  GGRROOUUPPSS  is  unset, it loses its special proper-
              ties, even if it is subsequently reset.

       HHIISSTTCCMMDD
              The history number, or index in the  history  list,
              of  the  current  command.  If HHIISSTTCCMMDD is unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is  subse-
              quently reset.

       HHOOSSTTNNAAMMEE
              Automatically  set to the name of the current host.

       HHOOSSTTTTYYPPEE
              Automatically  set  to  a  string   that   uniquely
              describes the type of machine on which bbaasshh is exe-

              current sequential line number  (starting  with  1)
              within  a script or function.  When not in a script
              or function, the value substituted is  not  guaran-
              teed  to  be  meaningful.   If  LLIINNEENNOO is unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is  subse-
              quently reset.

       MMAACCHHTTYYPPEE
              Automatically  set to a string that fully describes
              the system type on which bbaasshh is executing, in  the
              standard   GNU   _c_p_u_-_c_o_m_p_a_n_y_-_s_y_s_t_e_m   format.   The
              default is system-dependent.

       OOLLDDPPWWDD The previous working directory as  set  by  the  ccdd
              command.

       OOPPTTAARRGG The  value of the last option argument processed by
              the ggeettooppttss builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMM--
              MMAANNDDSS below).

       OOPPTTIINNDD The  index  of the next argument to be processed by
              the ggeettooppttss builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMM--
              MMAANNDDSS below).

       OOSSTTYYPPEE Automatically  set  to  a string that describes the
              operating system on which bbaasshh is  executing.   The
              default is system-dependent.

       PPIIPPEESSTTAATTUUSS
              An  array  variable (see AArrrraayyss below) containing a
              list of exit status values from  the  processes  in
              the   most-recently-executed   foreground  pipeline
              (which may contain only a single command).

       PPPPIIDD   The process ID of the shell's parent.   This  vari-
              able is readonly.

       PPWWDD    The current working directory as set by the ccdd com-
              mand.

       RRAANNDDOOMM Each time this parameter is  referenced,  a  random
              integer  between  0  and  32767  is generated.  The
              sequence of random numbers may  be  initialized  by
              assigning  a  value to RRAANNDDOOMM.  If RRAANNDDOOMM is unset,
              it loses its special properties, even if it is sub-
              sequently reset.

       RREEPPLLYY  Set  to  the line of input read by the rreeaadd builtin
              command when no arguments are supplied.

       SSEECCOONNDDSS
              Each time this parameter is referenced, the  number
              of  seconds since shell invocation is returned.  If
              a value is assigned to SSEECCOONNDDSS, the value  returned

              upon subsequent references is the number of seconds
              since the assignment plus the value  assigned.   If
              SSEECCOONNDDSS  is unset, it loses its special properties,
              even if it is subsequently reset.

       SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS
              A colon-separated list of  enabled  shell  options.
              Each  word  in the list is a valid argument for the
              --oo option to the sseett  builtin  command  (see  SSHHEELLLL
              BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  The options appearing in
              SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS are those reported as _o_n by sseett  --oo.   If
              this  variable  is  in  the  environment  when bbaasshh
              starts up, each shell option in the  list  will  be
              enabled  before  reading  any  startup files.  This
              variable is read-only.

       SSHHLLVVLL  Incremented by one each time an instance of bbaasshh is
              started.

       UUIIDD    Expands  to  the  user ID of the current user, ini-
              tialized at shell startup.  This variable is  read-
              only.

       The  following  variables  are used by the shell.  In some
       cases, bbaasshh assigns a default value to a  variable;  these
       cases are noted below.

       BBAASSHH__EENNVV
              If  this  parameter is set when bbaasshh is executing a
              shell script, its value is interpreted as  a  file-
              name  containing  commands to initialize the shell,
              as in _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c.  The value  of  BBAASSHH__EENNVV  is  sub-
              jected  to  parameter  expansion, command substitu-
              tion, and arithmetic expansion before being  inter-
              preted  as a file name.  PPAATTHH is not used to search
              for the resultant file name.
       CCDDPPAATTHH The search path for the  ccdd  command.   This  is  a
              colon-separated  list  of  directories in which the
              shell looks for destination  directories  specified
              by the ccdd command.  A sample value is ``.:~:/usr''.
       CCOOLLUUMMNNSS
              Used by the sseelleecctt builtin command to determine the
              terminal   width  when  printing  selection  lists.
              Automatically set upon receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       CCOOMMPPRREEPPLLYY
              An array variable from which bbaasshh reads the  possi-
              ble  completions  generated  by  a  shell  function
              invoked by  the  programmable  completion  facility
              (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).
       FFCCEEDDIITT The default editor for the ffcc builtin command.
       FFIIGGNNOORREE
              A  colon-separated  list of suffixes to ignore when
              performing  filename   completion   (see   RREEAADDLLIINNEE
              below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the

              entries in FFIIGGNNOORREE is excluded  from  the  list  of
              matched filenames.  A sample value is ``.o:~''.
       GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE
              A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set
              of filenames to be ignored by  pathname  expansion.
              If  a filename matched by a pathname expansion pat-
              tern also matches one of the  patterns  in  GGLLOOBBIIGG--
              NNOORREE, it is removed from the list of matches.
       HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL
              If set to a value of _i_g_n_o_r_e_s_p_a_c_e, lines which begin
              with a ssppaaccee character are not entered on the  his-
              tory  list.  If set to a value of _i_g_n_o_r_e_d_u_p_s, lines
              matching the last history line are not entered.   A
              value  of  _i_g_n_o_r_e_b_o_t_h combines the two options.  If
              unset, or if set to  any  other  value  than  those
              above,  all  lines  read by the parser are saved on
              the history list, subject to the value  of  HHIISSTTIIGG--
              NNOORREE.   This  variable's  function is superseded by
              HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE.  The second and subsequent lines  of  a
              multi-line compound command are not tested, and are
              added to the history regardless  of  the  value  of
              HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL.
       HHIISSTTFFIILLEE
              The  name  of  the file in which command history is
              saved (see HHIISSTTOORRYY below).  The  default  value  is
              _~_/_._b_a_s_h___h_i_s_t_o_r_y.   If unset, the command history is
              not saved when an interactive shell exits.
       HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE
              The maximum number of lines contained in  the  his-
              tory file.  When this variable is assigned a value,
              the history file is  truncated,  if  necessary,  to
              contain  no  more  than  that number of lines.  The
              default value is 500.  The  history  file  is  also
              truncated  to  this  size  after writing it when an
              interactive shell exits.
       HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE
              A colon-separated list of patterns used  to  decide
              which  command lines should be saved on the history
              list.  Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of
              the  line  and  must  match  the  complete line (no
              implicit `**' is appended).  Each pattern is  tested
              against  the  line  after  the  checks specified by
              HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL are applied.  In addition to the normal
              shell  pattern matching characters, `&&' matches the
              previous history line.  `&&' may be escaped using  a
              backslash; the backslash is removed before attempt-
              ing a match.  The second and subsequent lines of  a
              multi-line compound command are not tested, and are
              added to the history regardless  of  the  value  of
              HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE.
       HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE
              The  number  of commands to remember in the command
              history (see HHIISSTTOORRYY below).  The default value  is
              500.

BASH(1)                                                   BASH(1)


       HHOOMMEE   The home directory of the current user; the default
              argument for the ccdd builtin command.  The value  of
              this  variable  is  also used when performing tilde
              expansion.
       HHOOSSTTFFIILLEE
              Contains the name of a file in the same  format  as
              _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s that should be read when the shell needs
              to complete a hostname.  The list of possible host-
              name  completions may be changed while the shell is
              running;  the  next  time  hostname  completion  is
              attempted after the value is changed, bbaasshh adds the
              contents of the new file to the existing list.   If
              HHOOSSTTFFIILLEE is set, but has no value, bbaasshh attempts to
              read _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s to  obtain  the  list  of  possible
              hostname  completions.  When HHOOSSTTFFIILLEE is unset, the
              hostname list is cleared.
       IIFFSS    The _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_l _F_i_e_l_d _S_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r that is used for  word
              splitting  after  expansion and to split lines into
              words with the rreeaadd builtin command.   The  default
              value is ``<space><tab><newline>''.
       IIGGNNOORREEEEOOFF
              Controls  the  action  of  an  interactive shell on
              receipt of an EEOOFF character as the sole input.   If
              set,  the  value  is  the number of consecutive EEOOFF
              characters which must be typed as the first charac-
              ters  on  an  input line before bbaasshh exits.  If the
              variable exists but does not have a numeric  value,
              or  has  no  value, the default value is 10.  If it
              does not exist, EEOOFF signifies the end of  input  to
              the shell.
       IINNPPUUTTRRCC
              The  filename  for the rreeaaddlliinnee startup file, over-
              riding the  default  of  _~_/_._i_n_p_u_t_r_c  (see  RREEAADDLLIINNEE
              below).
       LLAANNGG   Used to determine the locale category for any cate-
              gory not  specifically  selected  with  a  variable
              starting with LLCC__.
       LLCC__AALLLL This  variable  overrides the value of LLAANNGG and any
              other LLCC__ variable specifying a locale category.
       LLCC__CCOOLLLLAATTEE
              This variable determines the collation  order  used
              when sorting the results of pathname expansion, and
              determines  the  behavior  of  range   expressions,
              equivalence classes, and collating sequences within
              pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE
              This  variable  determines  the  interpretation  of
              characters  and  the  behavior of character classes
              within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS
              This variable determines the locale used to  trans-

              for number formatting.
       LLIINNEESS  Used by the sseelleecctt builtin command to determine the
              column  length for printing selection lists.  Auto-
              matically set upon receipt of a SIGWINCH.
       MMAAIILL   If this parameter is set to a  file  name  and  the
              MMAAIILLPPAATTHH variable is not set, bbaasshh informs the user
              of the arrival of mail in the specified file.
       MMAAIILLCCHHEECCKK
              Specifies how often (in seconds)  bbaasshh  checks  for
              mail.   The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time
              to check for mail, the shell does  so  before  dis-
              playing  the  primary  prompt.  If this variable is
              unset, or set to a  value  that  is  not  a  number
              greater  than  or equal to zero, the shell disables
              mail checking.
       MMAAIILLPPAATTHH
              A colon-separated list of file names to be  checked
              for  mail.   The  message  to  be printed when mail
              arrives in a particular file may  be  specified  by
              separating  the  file  name from the message with a
              `?'.  When used in the  text  of  the  message,  $$__
              expands to the name of the current mailfile.  Exam-
              ple:
              MMAAIILLPPAATTHH='/var/mail/bfox?"You                  have
              mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has mail!"'
              BBaasshh  supplies  a  default value for this variable,
              but the location of the user  mail  files  that  it
              uses is system dependent (e.g., /var/mail/$$UUSSEERR).
       OOPPTTEERRRR If set to the value 1, bbaasshh displays error messages
              generated by the ggeettooppttss builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL
              BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  OOPPTTEERRRR is initialized to
              1 each time the shell is invoked or a shell  script
              is executed.
       PPAATTHH   The  search path for commands.  It is a colon-sepa-
              rated list of directories in which the shell  looks
              for  commands  (see  CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN below).  The
              default path is system-dependent, and is set by the
              administrator who installs bbaasshh.  A common value is
              ``/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ucb:/bin:/usr/bin:.''.
       PPOOSSIIXXLLYY__CCOORRRREECCTT
              If  this  variable  is in the environment when bbaasshh
              starts, the shell enters _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e before  reading
              the  startup  files,  as  if the ----ppoossiixx invocation
              option had been supplied.  If it is set  while  the
              shell  is  running,  bbaasshh enables _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, as if
              the command _s_e_t _-_o _p_o_s_i_x had been executed.

              default is ``>> ''.
       PPSS33    The  value  of this parameter is used as the prompt
              for the sseelleecctt command (see SSHHEELLLL GGRRAAMMMMAARR above).
       PPSS44    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PPSS11
              and  the  value is printed before each command bbaasshh
              displays during  an  execution  trace.   The  first
              character  of  PPSS44 is replicated multiple times, as
              necessary, to indicate multiple levels of  indirec-
              tion.  The default is ``++ ''.
       TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT
              The  value  of  this  parameter is used as a format
              string specifying how the  timing  information  for
              pipelines  prefixed  with  the  ttiimmee  reserved word
              should be displayed.  The %% character introduces an
              escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or
              other information.  The escape sequences and  their
              meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional
              portions.
              %%%%        A literal %%.
              %%[[_p]][[ll]]RR  The elapsed time in seconds.
              %%[[_p]][[ll]]UU  The number of CPU seconds spent  in  user
                        mode.
              %%[[_p]][[ll]]SS  The number of CPU seconds spent in system
                        mode.
              %%PP        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S)
                        / %R.

              The optional _p is a digit specifying the _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n,
              the number of fractional  digits  after  a  decimal
              point.   A  value  of  0 causes no decimal point or
              fraction to be output.  At most three places  after
              the  decimal  point  may  be specified; values of _p
              greater than 3 are changed to 3.  If _p is not spec-
              ified, the value 3 is used.

              The optional ll specifies a longer format, including
              minutes, of the form _M_Mm_S_S._F_Fs.   The  value  of  _p
              determines whether or not the fraction is included.

              If this variable is not set, bbaasshh acts as if it had
              the value $$''\\nnrreeaall\\tt%%33llRR\\nnuusseerr\\tt%%33llUU\\nnssyyss%%33llSS''.  If
              the value is null, no timing  information  is  dis-
              played.   A trailing newline is added when the for-
              mat string is displayed.

       TTMMOOUUTT  If set to a value greater than zero, the  value  is
              interpreted  as  the  number of seconds to wait for
              input after issuing the primary prompt.  BBaasshh  ter-
              minates after waiting for that number of seconds if
              input does not arrive.

              single word simple  commands  without  redirections
              are  treated  as  candidates  for  resumption of an
              existing  stopped  job.   There  is  no   ambiguity
              allowed;  if  there  is more than one job beginning
              with  the  string  typed,  the  job  most  recently
              accessed  is  selected.  The _n_a_m_e of a stopped job,
              in this context, is the command line used to  start
              it.  If set to the value _e_x_a_c_t, the string supplied
              must match the name of a stopped  job  exactly;  if
              set  to  _s_u_b_s_t_r_i_n_g,  the  string  supplied needs to
              match a substring of the name  of  a  stopped  job.
              The  _s_u_b_s_t_r_i_n_g  value provides functionality analo-
              gous to the %%??  job  identifier  (see  JJOOBB  CCOONNTTRROOLL
              below).   If  set  to any other value, the supplied
              string must be a prefix of a  stopped  job's  name;
              this  provides functionality analogous to the %% job
              identifier.

       hhiissttcchhaarrss
              The two or three characters which  control  history
              expansion  and  tokenization (see HHIISSTTOORRYY EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
              below).  The first character is the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y  _e_x_p_a_n_-
              _s_i_o_n  character,  the  character  which signals the
              start of a history expansion,  normally  `!!'.   The
              second  character is the _q_u_i_c_k _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n charac-
              ter, which is used as shorthand for re-running  the
              previous  command  entered, substituting one string
              for another in the command.  The  default  is  `^^'.
              The optional third character is the character which
              indicates that the remainder of the line is a  com-
              ment  when  found as the first character of a word,
              normally `##'.  The history comment character causes
              history  substitution to be skipped for the remain-
              ing words on the line.   It  does  not  necessarily
              cause  the  shell  parser  to treat the rest of the
              line as a comment.

   AArrrraayyss
       BBaasshh provides one-dimensional array variables.  Any  vari-
       able  may  be  used  as an array; the ddeeccllaarree builtin will
       explicitly declare an array.  There is no maximum limit on
       the  size of an array, nor any requirement that members be
       indexed or  assigned  contiguously.   Arrays  are  indexed
       using integers and are zero-based.

       An  array  is  created  automatically  if  any variable is
       assigned to using the syntax  _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]=_v_a_l_u_e.   The
       _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is treated as an arithmetic expression that must
       evaluate to a number greater than or equal  to  zero.   To
       explicitly  declare  an  array,  use  ddeeccllaarree --aa _n_a_m_e (see
       SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  ddeeccllaarree --aa _n_a_m_e[[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]]
       is  also  accepted;  the _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is ignored.  Attributes
       may be specified for an array variable using  the  ddeeccllaarree
       and  rreeaaddoonnllyy  builtins.   Each  attribute  applies to all

       members of an array.

       Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments  of  the
       form  _n_a_m_e=((value_1 ... value_n)), where each _v_a_l_u_e is of the
       form [_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]=_s_t_r_i_n_g.  Only _s_t_r_i_n_g is required.  If the
       optional  brackets  and subscript are supplied, that index
       is  assigned  to;  otherwise  the  index  of  the  element
       assigned  is  the  last index assigned to by the statement
       plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.  This syntax  is  also
       accepted  by  the  ddeeccllaarree builtin.  Individual array ele-
       ments may be assigned to using  the  _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]=_v_a_l_u_e
       syntax introduced above.

       Any   element   of   an  array  may  be  referenced  using
       ${_n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]}.  The braces are required to avoid con-
       flicts  with  pathname expansion.  If _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is @@ or **,
       the word expands to all members of _n_a_m_e.  These subscripts
       differ  only  when  the word appears within double quotes.
       If the word is double-quoted, ${_n_a_m_e[*]} expands to a sin-
       gle  word with the value of each array member separated by
       the first character  of  the  IIFFSS  special  variable,  and
       ${_n_a_m_e[@]}  expands  each  element  of  _n_a_m_e to a separate
       word.  When there are no array members, ${_n_a_m_e[@]} expands
       to  nothing.   This  is  analogous to the expansion of the
       special parameters ** and @@ (see SSppeecciiaall PPaarraammeetteerrss above).
       ${#_n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]}  expands  to the length of ${_n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_-
       _s_c_r_i_p_t]}.  If _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is ** or @@, the  expansion  is  the
       number  of  elements  in  the array.  Referencing an array
       variable without a subscript is equivalent to  referencing
       element zero.

       The  uunnsseett  builtin  is  used  to  destroy  arrays.  uunnsseett
       _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t] destroys the array element at  index  _s_u_b_-
       _s_c_r_i_p_t.   uunnsseett  _n_a_m_e,  where  _n_a_m_e  is an array, or uunnsseett
       _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t], where _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is ** or  @@,  removes  the
       entire array.

       The ddeeccllaarree, llooccaall, and rreeaaddoonnllyy builtins each accept a --aa
       option to specify an array.  The rreeaadd builtin accepts a --aa
       option  to  assign  a list of words read from the standard
       input to an array.  The sseett and ddeeccllaarree  builtins  display
       array  values  in  a  way that allows them to be reused as
       assignments.

EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       Expansion is performed on the command line  after  it  has
       been split into words.  There are seven kinds of expansion
       performed: _b_r_a_c_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, _t_i_l_d_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r _a_n_d
       _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e   _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n,   _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n,  _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c
       _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, _w_o_r_d _s_p_l_i_t_t_i_n_g, and _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.

       The order of expansions is: brace expansion, tilde  expan-
       sion,  parameter,  variable  and  arithmetic expansion and
       command substitution (done in  a  left-to-right  fashion),

       word splitting, and pathname expansion.

       On  systems  that  can  support it, there is an additional
       expansion available: _p_r_o_c_e_s_s _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n.

       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname  expan-
       sion  can  change  the  number  of words of the expansion;
       other expansions expand a single word to  a  single  word.
       The only exceptions to this are the expansions of "$$@@" and
       "$${{_n_a_m_e[[@@]]}}" as explained above (see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS).

       _B_r_a_c_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n is a mechanism by which arbitrary  strings
       may  be  generated.  This mechanism is similar to _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e
       _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, but the filenames  generated  need  not  exist.
       Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional
       _p_r_e_a_m_b_l_e, followed by a series of comma-separated  strings
       between   a  pair  of  braces,  followed  by  an  optional
       _p_o_s_t_s_c_r_i_p_t.  The preamble is prefixed to each string  con-
       tained  within  the  braces,  and  the  postscript is then
       appended to  each  resulting  string,  expanding  left  to
       right.

       Brace  expansions  may  be  nested.   The  results of each
       expanded string are not sorted; left  to  right  order  is
       preserved.   For  example, a{{d,c,b}}e expands into `ade ace
       abe'.

       Brace expansion is performed before any other  expansions,
       and  any  characters  special to other expansions are pre-
       served in the result.  It is strictly textual.  BBaasshh  does
       not  apply  any syntactic interpretation to the context of
       the expansion or the text between the braces.

       A correctly-formed brace expansion must  contain  unquoted
       opening  and  closing  braces,  and  at least one unquoted
       comma.  Any incorrectly formed  brace  expansion  is  left
       unchanged.   A  {{  or  ,, may be quoted with a backslash to
       prevent its being considered part of a  brace  expression.
       To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string $${{
       is not considered eligible for brace expansion.

       This construct is typically used  as  shorthand  when  the
       common  prefix  of  the  strings to be generated is longer
       than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace  expansion  introduces a slight incompatibility with
       historical versions of sshh.  sshh does not treat  opening  or
       closing  braces  specially  when  they appear as part of a
       word, and preserves them  in  the  output.   BBaasshh  removes

       identically  in  the  output.   The same word is output as
       _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 after expansion by bbaasshh.  If  strict  compati-
       bility  with  sshh is desired, start bbaasshh with the ++BB option
       or disable brace expansion with the ++BB option to  the  sseett
       command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       If  a  word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~~'),
       all of the characters preceding the first  unquoted  slash
       (or  all  characters,  if  there is no unquoted slash) are
       considered a _t_i_l_d_e_-_p_r_e_f_i_x.  If none of the  characters  in
       the  tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-
       prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible _l_o_g_i_n
       _n_a_m_e.  If this login name is the null string, the tilde is
       replaced with the value of the shell parameter  HHOOMMEE.   If
       HHOOMMEE  is  unset,  the home directory of the user executing
       the shell is substituted instead.  Otherwise,  the  tilde-
       prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with
       the specified login name.

       If the tilde-prefix is a `~+',  the  value  of  the  shell
       variable PPWWDD replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-pre-
       fix is a `~-', the value of the shell variable OOLLDDPPWWDD,  if
       it  is  set,  is substituted.  If the characters following
       the tilde in the  tilde-prefix  consist  of  a  number  _N,
       optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the tilde-prefix is
       replaced with the corresponding element from the directory
       stack,  as  it  would  be  displayed  by  the ddiirrss builtin
       invoked with the tilde-prefix  as  an  argument.   If  the
       characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist
       of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is  assumed.

       If  the  login  name  is  invalid,  or the tilde expansion
       fails, the word is unchanged.

       Each variable assignment is checked  for  unquoted  tilde-
       prefixes  immediately following a :: or ==.  In these cases,
       tilde expansion is also performed.  Consequently, one  may
       use  file  names with tildes in assignments to PPAATTHH, MMAAIILL--
       PPAATTHH, and CCDDPPAATTHH,  and  the  shell  assigns  the  expanded
       value.

       The  `$$' character introduces parameter expansion, command
       substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name
       or  symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which
       are optional but serve  to  protect  the  variable  to  be
       expanded  from  characters  immediately following it which
       could be interpreted as part of the name.

              The  value of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is substituted.  The braces
              are required when _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is a positional parame-
              ter  with more than one digit, or when _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is
              followed by a character which is not to  be  inter-
              preted as part of its name.

       If  the  first  character  of  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an exclamation
       point, a level  of  variable  indirection  is  introduced.
       BBaasshh  uses  the value of the variable formed from the rest
       of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r as the name of the variable; this variable is
       then  expanded  and  that value is used in the rest of the
       substitution, rather than the value of  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r  itself.
       This  is  known  as  _i_n_d_i_r_e_c_t _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.  The exception to
       this is the expansion of ${!_p_r_e_f_i_x*} described below.

       In each of the cases  below,  _w_o_r_d  is  subject  to  tilde
       expansion,  parameter expansion, command substitution, and
       arithmetic  expansion.   When  not  performing   substring
       expansion,  bbaasshh  tests  for  a parameter that is unset or
       null; omitting the colon results in  a  test  only  for  a
       parameter that is unset.

       quotes, but a double quote inside the parentheses  is  not
       treated  specially.   All tokens in the expression undergo
       parameter expansion, string expansion,  command  substitu-
       tion,  and quote removal.  Arithmetic substitutions may be
       nested.

       The evaluation is performed according to the rules  listed
       below  under  AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC  EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN.   If  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  is
       invalid, bbaasshh prints a message indicating failure  and  no

       named pipes (_F_I_F_O_s) or the //ddeevv//ffdd method of  naming  open
       files.  It takes the form of <<((_l_i_s_t)) or >>((_l_i_s_t)).  The pro-
       cess _l_i_s_t is run with its input or output connected  to  a
       _F_I_F_O  or  some  file in //ddeevv//ffdd.  The name of this file is
       passed as an argument to the current command as the result
       of the expansion.  If the >>((_l_i_s_t)) form is used, writing to
       the file will provide input for _l_i_s_t.  If the <<((_l_i_s_t)) form
       is  used, the file passed as an argument should be read to
       obtain the output of _l_i_s_t.

       When available, process substitution is performed simulta-
       neously  with  parameter  and  variable expansion, command
       substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

       The shell scans the results of parameter  expansion,  com-
       mand  substitution,  and arithmetic expansion that did not
       occur within double quotes for _w_o_r_d _s_p_l_i_t_t_i_n_g.

       The shell treats each character of IIFFSS as a delimiter, and
       splits  the  results of the other expansions into words on
       these characters.  If  IIFFSS  is  unset,  or  its  value  is
       exactly   <<ssppaaccee>><<ttaabb>><<nneewwlliinnee>>,  the  default,  then  any
       sequence of IIFFSS characters serves to  delimit  words.   If
       IIFFSS  has a value other than the default, then sequences of
       the whitespace characters ssppaaccee and ttaabb are ignored at the
       beginning  and  end of the word, as long as the whitespace
       character is in the value of IIFFSS (an IIFFSS whitespace  char-
       acter).   Any character in IIFFSS that is not IIFFSS whitespace,

       along with any adjacent IIFFSS whitespace characters,  delim-
       its  a  field.  A sequence of IIFFSS whitespace characters is
       also treated as a delimiter.  If the value of IIFFSS is null,
       no word splitting occurs.

       Explicit null arguments ("""" or '''') are retained.  Unquoted
       implicit null arguments, resulting from the  expansion  of
       parameters that have no values, are removed.  If a parame-
       ter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null
       argument results and is retained.

       Note  that  if  no  expansion occurs, no splitting is per-
       formed.

       After word splitting, unless the --ff option has  been  set,
       bbaasshh  scans  each word for the characters **, ??, and [[.  If
       one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded
       as  a  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, and replaced with an alphabetically sorted
       list of file names matching the pattern.  If  no  matching
       file  names  are  found,  and the shell option nnuullllgglloobb is
       disabled, the word is left  unchanged.   If  the  nnuullllgglloobb
       option  is  set,  and  no  matches  are found, the word is
       removed.  If the shell option nnooccaasseegglloobb is  enabled,  the
       match  is  performed  without regard to the case of alpha-
       betic characters.  When a pattern  is  used  for  pathname
       expansion,  the character ````..''''  at the start of a name or
       immediately following a slash must be matched  explicitly,
       unless  the  shell option ddoottgglloobb is set.  When matching a
       pathname, the  slash  character  must  always  be  matched
       explicitly.   In  other cases, the ````..''''  character is not
       treated specially.  See the  description  of  sshhoopptt  below
       under  SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  for  a description of the

       The GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE shell variable may be used to restrict  the
       set  of  file  names matching a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  If GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE is
       set, each matching file name that also matches one of  the
       patterns  in  GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE  is  removed  from  the  list  of
       matches.  The file names ````..''''   and  ````....''''   are  always
       ignored,  even  when  GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE is set.  However, setting
       GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE has the effect of enabling  the  ddoottgglloobb  shell
       option,  so  all  other  file names beginning with a ````..''''
       will match.  To get the  old  behavior  of  ignoring  file
       names beginning with a ````..'''', make ````..**''''  one of the pat-
       terns in GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE.  The ddoottgglloobb option is disabled  when
       GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE is unset.

       to be matched literally.

       The  special  pattern  characters have the following mean-
       ings:

       **      Matches any string, including the null string.
       ??      Matches any single character.
       [[......]]  Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair
              of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a _r_a_n_g_e
              _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n; any character that sorts between  those
              two   characters,   inclusive,  using  the  current
              locale's collating sequence and character  set,  is
              matched.  If the first character following the [[ is
              a !!  or a ^^ then  any  character  not  enclosed  is
              matched.   The sorting order of characters in range
              expressions is determined by the current locale and
              the value of the LLCC__CCOOLLLLAATTEE shell variable, if set.
              A -- may be matched by including it as the first  or
              last  character  in the set.  A ]] may be matched by
              including it as the first character in the set.

              Within [[ and ]], _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _c_l_a_s_s_e_s can be  specified
              using  the  syntax [[::_c_l_a_s_s::]], where _c_l_a_s_s is one of
              the following classes defined in the POSIX.2  stan-
              dard:

              A character class matches any  character  belonging
              to that class.

              Within  [[ and ]], an _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e _c_l_a_s_s can be speci-
              fied using the  syntax  [[==_c==]],  which  matches  all
              characters  with  the  same  collation  weight  (as
              defined by the current locale) as the character  _c.

              Within  [[  and ]], the syntax [[.._s_y_m_b_o_l..]] matches the
              collating symbol _s_y_m_b_o_l.

       If the eexxttgglloobb shell option is  enabled  using  the  sshhoopptt
       builtin,  several  extended pattern matching operators are
       recognized.  In the following description, a  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t
       is  a list of one or more patterns separated by a ||.  Com-
       posite patterns may be formed using one  or  more  of  the
       following sub-patterns:

              ??((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))
                     Matches  zero or one occurrence of the given

              **((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))

       Before  a command is executed, its input and output may be
       _r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_e_d using a special  notation  interpreted  by  the
       shell.   Redirection  may  also  be used to open and close
       files for the current shell  execution  environment.   The
       following redirection operators may precede or appear any-
       where within a _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d or  may  follow  a  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.
       Redirections  are processed in the order they appear, from
       left to right.

       In the following descriptions, if the file descriptor num-
       ber is omitted, and the first character of the redirection
       operator is <<, the  redirection  refers  to  the  standard
       input  (file descriptor 0).  If the first character of the
       redirection operator is >>, the redirection refers  to  the
       standard output (file descriptor 1).

       The word following the redirection operator in the follow-
       ing descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected  to
       brace  expansion,  tilde  expansion,  parameter expansion,
       command substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal,
       pathname  expansion, and word splitting.  If it expands to
       more than one word, bbaasshh reports an error.

       Note that the order of redirections is  significant.   For
       example, the command

              ls >> dirlist 2>>&&1

       directs  both  standard  output  and standard error to the
       file _d_i_r_l_i_s_t, while the command

              ls 2>>&&1 >> dirlist

       directs only the standard output to file _d_i_r_l_i_s_t,  because
       the  standard  error  was  duplicated  as  standard output
       before the standard output was redirected to _d_i_r_l_i_s_t.

       BBaasshh handles several filenames  specially  when  they  are
       used in redirections, as described in the following table:

              //ddeevv//ffdd//_f_d
                     If _f_d is a valid integer, file descriptor _f_d

              >>&&_w_o_r_d

       Of  the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is seman-
       tically equivalent to

              >>_w_o_r_d 2>>&&1

       This type of redirection instructs the shell to read input
       from  the current source until a line containing only _w_o_r_d
       (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines  read
       up to that point are then used as the standard input for a
       command.

       The format of here-documents is as follows:

              <<<<[--]_w_o_r_d
                      _h_e_r_e_-_d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t
              _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r

       No parameter expansion, command  substitution,  arithmetic
       expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on _w_o_r_d.  If
       any characters in _w_o_r_d are quoted, the  _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r  is  the
       result  of  quote  removal  on  _w_o_r_d, and the lines in the
       here-document are not expanded.  If _w_o_r_d is unquoted,  all
       lines  of  the  here-document  are  subjected to parameter
       expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.
       In  the  latter case, the character sequence \\<<nneewwlliinnee>> is
       ignored, and \\ must be used to quote the characters \\,  $$,
       and ``.

       If  the  redirection operator is <<<<--, then all leading tab
       characters are stripped from input lines and the line con-
       taining  _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r.   This  allows  here-documents  within

       The redirection operator

              [_n]<<&&_w_o_r_d

       is used to duplicate  input  file  descriptors.   If  _w_o_r_d
       expands to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted
       by _n is made to be a copy of that file descriptor.  If the
       digits  in  _w_o_r_d do not specify a file descriptor open for
       input, a redirection error occurs.  If _w_o_r_d  evaluates  to
       --,  file  descriptor  _n is closed.  If _n is not specified,
       the standard input (file descriptor 0) is used.

       The operator

              [_n]>>&&_w_o_r_d

       is used similarly to duplicate  output  file  descriptors.
       If  _n is not specified, the standard output (file descrip-
       tor 1) is used.  If the digits in _w_o_r_d do  not  specify  a
       file  descriptor  open  for  output,  a  redirection error
       occurs.  As a special case, if _n is omitted, and _w_o_r_d does
       not  expand to one or more digits, the standard output and
       standard error are redirected as described previously.

       The redirection operator

              [_n]<<>>_w_o_r_d

       causes the file whose name is the expansion of _w_o_r_d to  be
       opened  for both reading and writing on file descriptor _n,
       or on file descriptor 0 if _n is  not  specified.   If  the
       file does not exist, it is created.

AALLIIAASSEESS
       _A_l_i_a_s_e_s  allow  a string to be substituted for a word when
       it is used as the first word of  a  simple  command.   The
       shell  maintains  a  list  of  aliases that may be set and
       unset with the aalliiaass and  uunnaalliiaass  builtin  commands  (see
       SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  below).   The first word of each
       command, if unquoted, is checked  to  see  if  it  has  an
       alias.   If  so,  that word is replaced by the text of the
       alias.  The alias name and the replacement text  may  con-
       tain  any  valid shell input, including the _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s
       listed above, with the exception that the alias  name  may
       not  contain _=.  The first word of the replacement text is
       tested for aliases, but a word that  is  identical  to  an
       alias  being expanded is not expanded a second time.  This
       means that one may alias llss to llss --FF,  for  instance,  and
       bbaasshh  does  not  try to recursively expand the replacement
       text.  If the last character  of  the  alias  value  is  a

       _b_l_a_n_k,  then  the next command word following the alias is
       also checked for alias expansion.

       Aliases are created and listed with the aalliiaass command, and
       removed with the uunnaalliiaass command.

       There  is no mechanism for using arguments in the replace-
       ment text.  If arguments  are  needed,  a  shell  function
       should be used (see FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS below).

       Aliases  are  not  expanded when the shell is not interac-
       tive, unless the eexxppaanndd__aalliiaasseess shell option is set  using
       sshhoopptt  (see  the  description of sshhoopptt under SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN
       CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are
       somewhat  confusing.   BBaasshh always reads at least one com-
       plete line of input before executing any of  the  commands
       on  that  line.   Aliases  are  expanded when a command is
       read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias  defi-
       nition  appearing on the same line as another command does
       not take effect until the next line of input is read.  The
       commands  following  the alias definition on that line are
       not affected by the new alias.  This behavior is  also  an
       issue  when  functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded
       when a function definition is read, not when the  function
       is  executed,  because  a  function definition is itself a
       compound command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in  a
       function  are  not  available until after that function is
       executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions  on  a
       separate  line, and do not use aalliiaass in compound commands.

       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by  shell
       functions.

FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS
       A  shell  function, defined as described above under SSHHEELLLL
       GGRRAAMMMMAARR, stores a series of commands for later  execution.
       When the name of a shell function is used as a simple com-
       mand name, the list of commands associated with that func-
       tion name is executed.  Functions are executed in the con-
       text of the current shell; no new process  is  created  to
       interpret  them  (contrast  this  with  the execution of a
       shell script).  When a function is executed, the arguments
       to  the  function  become the positional parameters during
       its execution.  The special  parameter  ##  is  updated  to
       reflect  the change.  Positional parameter 0 is unchanged.
       The FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE variable is set to the name of  the  function
       while the function is executing.  All other aspects of the
       shell execution environment are identical between a  func-
       tion and its caller with the exception that the DDEEBBUUGG trap
       (see the description  of  the  ttrraapp  builtin  under  SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below) is not inherited.

       Variables  local  to the function may be declared with the
       llooccaall builtin command.  Ordinarily,  variables  and  their
       values are shared between the function and its caller.

       If  the  builtin command rreettuurrnn is executed in a function,
       the function completes and execution resumes with the next
       command  after  the  function  call.  When a function com-
       pletes, the values of the positional  parameters  and  the
       special  parameter  ##  are restored to the values they had
       prior to the function's execution.

       Function names and definitions may be listed with  the  --ff
       option to the ddeeccllaarree or ttyyppeesseett builtin commands.  The --FF
       option to ddeeccllaarree or ttyyppeesseett will list the function  names
       only.   Functions  may be exported so that subshells auto-
       matically have them defined with  the  --ff  option  to  the
       eexxppoorrtt builtin.

       Functions  may  be  recursive.  No limit is imposed on the
       number of recursive calls.

       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to  be  evaluated,
       under  certain  circumstances (see the lleett builtin command
       and AArriitthhmmeettiicc EExxppaannssiioonn).  Evaluation  is  done  in  long
       integers  with no check for overflow, though division by 0
       is trapped and flagged as an  error.   The  operators  and
       their  precedence and associativity are the same as in the
       C language.  The following list of  operators  is  grouped
       into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are
       listed in order of decreasing precedence.

       Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter  expan-
       sion  is  performed  before  the  expression is evaluated.
       Within an expression, shell variables may also  be  refer-
       enced  by  name without using the parameter expansion syn-
       tax.  The value of a variable is evaluated  as  an  arith-
       metic  expression when it is referenced.  A shell variable
       need not have its integer attribute turned on to  be  used
       in an expression.

       Constants  with  a leading 0 are interpreted as octal num-
       bers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise,
       numbers  take  the  form [_b_a_s_e_#]n, where _b_a_s_e is a decimal
       number between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic  base,
       and _n is a number in that base.  If _b_a_s_e_# is omitted, then
       base 10 is used.  The digits greater  than  9  are  repre-
       sented by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @,
       and _, in that order.  If _b_a_s_e is less than  or  equal  to
       36,  lowercase  and  uppercase  letters may be used inter-
       changably to represent numbers between 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated  in  order  of  precedence.   Sub-
       expressions  in  parentheses  are  evaluated first and may
       override the precedence rules above.

       Conditional expressions are used by the [[[[  compound  com-

       attributes and perform string and arithmetic  comparisons.
       Expressions  are formed from the following unary or binary
       primaries.  If any _f_i_l_e argument to one of  the  primaries
       is  of  the  form  _/_d_e_v_/_f_d_/_n,  then  file  descriptor _n is

       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs  the
       following  expansions, assignments, and redirections, from
       left to right.

       1.     The words that the parser has  marked  as  variable
              assignments  (those preceding the command name) and
              redirections are saved for later processing.

       2.     The words that  are  not  variable  assignments  or
              redirections  are  expanded.   If  any words remain
              after expansion, the first word is taken to be  the
              name of the command and the remaining words are the
              arguments.

       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under
              RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN.

       4.     The  text  after  the == in each variable assignment
              undergoes  tilde  expansion,  parameter  expansion,
              command  substitution,  arithmetic  expansion,  and
              quote removal before being assigned  to  the  vari-
              able.

       If  no  command  name  results,  the  variable assignments
       affect the  current  shell  environment.   Otherwise,  the
       variables  are  added  to  the environment of the executed
       command and do not affect the current  shell  environment.
       If  any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a
       readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command  exits
       with a non-zero status.

       If  no  command  name results, redirections are performed,
       but do not affect the current shell environment.  A  redi-
       rection  error  causes the command to exit with a non-zero
       status.

       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution
       proceeds  as  described  below.   Otherwise,  the  command
       exits.  If one  of  the  expansions  contained  a  command

       substitution,  the  exit status of the command is the exit
       status of the last  command  substitution  performed.   If
       there  were  no  command  substitutions, the command exits
       with a status of zero.

       After a command has been split into words, if  it  results
       in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the
       following actions are taken.

       If  the  command  name  contains  no  slashes,  the  shell
       attempts  to  locate it.  If there exists a shell function
       by that name, that function is invoked as described  above
       in  FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS.  If the name does not match a function, the
       shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a
       match is found, that builtin is invoked.

       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and
       contains no slashes, bbaasshh searches  each  element  of  the
       PPAATTHH for a directory containing an executable file by that
       name.  BBaasshh uses a hash table to remember the  full  path-
       names  of  executable  files (see hhaasshh under SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN
       CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  A full search of the directories in PPAATTHH
       is  performed only if the command is not found in the hash
       table.  If the search is unsuccessful, the shell prints an
       error message and returns an exit status of 127.

       If  the  search is successful, or if the command name con-
       tains one or more slashes, the shell  executes  the  named
       program  in  a separate execution environment.  Argument 0
       is set to the name given, and the remaining  arguments  to
       the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

       If  this  execution  fails because the file is not in exe-
       cutable format, and the file is not  a  directory,  it  is
       assumed to be a _s_h_e_l_l _s_c_r_i_p_t, a file containing shell com-
       mands.  A subshell is spawned to execute  it.   This  sub-
       shell  reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a
       new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with  the
       exception that the locations of commands remembered by the
       parent (see hhaasshh below under SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS)  are
       retained by the child.

       If  the program is a file beginning with ##!!, the remainder
       of the first line specifies an interpreter  for  the  pro-
       gram.   The  shell  executes  the specified interpreter on
       operating systems that do not handle this executable  for-
       mat  themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist
       of a single optional argument  following  the  interpreter
       name  on  the  first  line of the program, followed by the
       name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if
       any.

       When  a simple command other than a builtin or shell func-

       A command invoked  in  this  separate  environment  cannot
       affect the shell's execution environment.

       Command substitution and asynchronous commands are invoked
       in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the shell
       environment,  except  that  traps  caught by the shell are
       reset to the values that the shell inherited from its par-
       ent  at  invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked as
       part of a pipeline are also executed in a  subshell  envi-
       ronment.   Changes made to the subshell environment cannot
       affect the shell's execution environment.

       If a command is followed by a && and  job  control  is  not
       active,  the default standard input for the command is the
       empty file  _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.   Otherwise,  the  invoked  command
       inherits the file descriptors of the calling shell as mod-
       ified by redirections.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       When a program is invoked it is given an array of  strings
       called  the  _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.   This  is  a list of _n_a_m_e-_v_a_l_u_e
       pairs, of the form _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e.

       The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environ-
       ment.   On invocation, the shell scans its own environment
       and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically
       marking  it  for _e_x_p_o_r_t to child processes.  Executed com-
       mands inherit the environment.  The eexxppoorrtt and ddeeccllaarree  --xx
       commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and
       deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter
       in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part
       of the environment, replacing the  old.   The  environment
       inherited  by any executed command consists of the shell's
       initial environment, whose values may be modified  in  the
       shell,  less  any pairs removed by the uunnsseett command, plus
       any additions via the eexxppoorrtt and ddeeccllaarree --xx commands.

       The environment for any _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d or function may  be
       augmented  temporarily  by  prefixing  it  with  parameter
       assignments, as  described  above  in  PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS.   These
       assignment  statements affect only the environment seen by
       that command.

       If the --kk option is  set  (see  the  sseett  builtin  command
       below),  then  _a_l_l parameter assignments are placed in the
       environment for a command, not just those that precede the
       command name.

       When  bbaasshh  invokes an external command, the variable __ is
       set to the full file name of the  command  and  passed  to
       that command in its environment.

       zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit  status  of  zero
       indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates fail-
       ure.  When a command terminates on a fatal signal _N,  bbaasshh
       uses the value of 128+_N as the exit status.

       If  a  command  is not found, the child process created to
       execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found
       but is not executable, the return status is 126.

       If a command fails because of an error during expansion or
       redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (_t_r_u_e) if suc-
       cessful,  and  non-zero  (_f_a_l_s_e)  if an error occurs while
       they execute.  All builtins return an exit status of 2  to
       indicate incorrect usage.

       BBaasshh  itself  returns  the exit status of the last command
       executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which  case  it
       exits  with  a  non-zero value.  See also the eexxiitt builtin
       command below.

SSIIGGNNAALLSS
       When bbaasshh is interactive, in the absence of any traps,  it
       ignores  SSIIGGTTEERRMM (so that kkiillll 00 does not kill an interac-
       tive shell), and SSIIGGIINNTT is caught and handled (so that the
       wwaaiitt  builtin  is  interruptible).   In  all  cases,  bbaasshh
       ignores SSIIGGQQUUIITT.   If  job  control  is  in  effect,  bbaasshh
       ignores SSIIGGTTTTIINN, SSIIGGTTTTOOUU, and SSIIGGTTSSTTPP.

       Synchronous  jobs started by bbaasshh have signal handlers set
       to the values inherited by  the  shell  from  its  parent.
       When  job  control is not in effect, asynchronous commands
       ignore SSIIGGIINNTT and SSIIGGQQUUIITT as  well.   Commands  run  as  a
       result  of command substitution ignore the keyboard-gener-
       ated job control signals SSIIGGTTTTIINN, SSIIGGTTTTOOUU, and SSIIGGTTSSTTPP.

       The shell exits by  default  upon  receipt  of  a  SSIIGGHHUUPP.
       Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the SSIIGGHHUUPP to
       all jobs, running or stopped.  Stopped jobs are sent  SSIIGG--
       CCOONNTT  to  ensure that they receive the SSIIGGHHUUPP.  To prevent
       the shell from sending the signal to a particular job,  it
       should  be  removed  from  the  jobs table with the ddiissoowwnn
       builtin (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below)  or  marked  to
       not receive SSIIGGHHUUPP using ddiissoowwnn --hh.

       If  the  hhuuppoonneexxiitt  shell  option has been set with sshhoopptt,
       bbaasshh sends a SSIIGGHHUUPP to all jobs when an interactive  login
       shell exits.

       When  bbaasshh receives a signal for which a trap has been set
       while waiting for a command to complete, the trap will not
       be  executed  until  the  command completes.  When bbaasshh is
       waiting for an asynchronous command via the wwaaiitt  builtin,

       the  reception  of  a signal for which a trap has been set
       will cause the wwaaiitt builtin to return immediately with  an

JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL
       _J_o_b _c_o_n_t_r_o_l refers to  the  ability  to  selectively  stop
       (_s_u_s_p_e_n_d) the execution of processes and continue (_r_e_s_u_m_e)
       their execution  at  a  later  point.   A  user  typically
       employs  this  facility  via an interactive interface sup-
       plied jointly by the system's terminal driver and bbaasshh.

       The shell associates a _j_o_b with each pipeline.  It keeps a
       table  of  currently  executing  jobs, which may be listed
       with the jjoobbss command.   When  bbaasshh  starts  a  job  asyn-
       chronously  (in  the  _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d),  it  prints a line that
       looks like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the pro-
       cess  ID  of  the  last process in the pipeline associated
       with this job is 25647.  All of the processes in a  single
       pipeline  are  members of the same job.  BBaasshh uses the _j_o_b
       abstraction as the basis for job control.

       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface  to
       job  control, the operating system maintains the notion of
       a _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _p_r_o_c_e_s_s _g_r_o_u_p _I_D.  Members of this pro-
       cess  group  (processes whose process group ID is equal to
       the current terminal process group ID)  receive  keyboard-
       generated  signals  such  as  SSIIGGIINNTT.  These processes are
       said to be in the _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d.   _B_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d  processes  are
       those  whose process group ID differs from the terminal's;
       such processes are immune to  keyboard-generated  signals.
       Only  foreground  processes  are  allowed  to read from or
       write to the terminal.  Background processes which attempt
       to  read  from  (write to) the terminal are sent a SSIIGGTTTTIINN
       ((SSIIGGTTTTOOUU)) signal by the  terminal  driver,  which,  unless
       caught, suspends the process.

       If  the operating system on which bbaasshh is running supports
       job control, bbaasshh contains facilities to use  it.   Typing
       the  _s_u_s_p_e_n_d  character  (typically ^^ZZ, Control-Z) while a
       process is running causes that process to be  stopped  and
       returns control to bbaasshh.  Typing the _d_e_l_a_y_e_d _s_u_s_p_e_n_d char-
       acter (typically ^^YY, Control-Y) causes the process  to  be
       stopped  when it attempts to read input from the terminal,
       and control to be returned to bbaasshh.   The  user  may  then
       manipulate  the state of this job, using the bbgg command to
       continue it in the background, the ffgg command to  continue
       it  in  the foreground, or the kkiillll command to kill it.  A

       discarded.

       There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.
       The  character  %% introduces a job name.  Job number _n may
       be referred to as %%nn.  A job may also be referred to using
       a  prefix  of  the  name used to start it, or using a sub-
       string that appears in its command line.  For example, %%ccee
       refers to a stopped ccee job.  If a prefix matches more than
       one job, bbaasshh reports an error.  Using %%??ccee, on the  other
       hand,  refers  to  any job containing the string ccee in its
       command line.  If the substring matches more than one job,
       bbaasshh reports an error.  The symbols %%%% and %%++ refer to the
       shell's notion of the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b, which is the  last  job
       stopped  while  it was in the foreground or started in the
       background.  The _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s _j_o_b may be referenced using  %%--.
       In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the jjoobbss
       command), the current job is always flagged with a ++,  and
       the previous job with a --.

       Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the fore-
       ground: %%11 is a synonym for ````ffgg %%11'''', bringing job 1 from
       the  background  into the foreground.  Similarly, ````%%11 &&''''
       resumes job 1 in the background, equivalent to ````bbgg  %%11''''.

       The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes state.
       Normally, bbaasshh waits until it is about to print  a  prompt
       before  reporting  changes  in a job's status so as to not
       interrupt any other output.  If the --bb option to  the  sseett
       builtin  command  is  enabled,  bbaasshh  reports such changes
       immediately.  Any trap on SSIIGGCCHHLLDD  is  executed  for  each
       child that exits.

       If an attempt to exit bbaasshh is made while jobs are stopped,
       the shell prints a warning message.  The jjoobbss command  may
       then be used to inspect their status.  If a second attempt
       to exit is made without an intervening command, the  shell
       does  not  print another warning, and the stopped jobs are
       terminated.

PPRROOMMPPTTIINNGG
       When executing interactively, bbaasshh  displays  the  primary
       prompt  PPSS11  when  it  is ready to read a command, and the
       secondary prompt PPSS22 when it needs more input to  complete
       a  command.   BBaasshh  allows these prompt strings to be cus-
       tomized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special
       characters that are decoded as follows:
              \\aa     an ASCII bell character (07)
              \\dd     the  date  in  "Weekday  Month  Date" format
                     (e.g., "Tue May 26")
              \\ee     an ASCII escape character (033)
              \\hh     the hostname up to the first `.'
              \\HH     the hostname
              \\jj     the number of jobs currently managed by  the
                     shell

       The command number and the history number are usually dif-

       the history list, which may include commands restored from
       the history file (see HHIISSTTOORRYY below),  while  the  command
       number  is  the  position in the sequence of commands exe-
       cuted during the current shell session.  After the  string
       is  decoded,  it is expanded via parameter expansion, com-
       mand  substitution,  arithmetic   expansion,   and   quote
       removal,  subject  to  the  value  of the pprroommppttvvaarrss shell

       This  is the library that handles reading input when using
       an interactive shell, unless  the  ----nnooeeddiittiinngg  option  is
       given  at  shell invocation.  By default, the line editing
       commands are similar to those of emacs.  A  vi-style  line
       editing  interface  is  also  available.  To turn off line
       editing after the shell is running, use the ++oo eemmaaccss or ++oo
       vvii  options to the sseett builtin (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS

       In this section,  the  emacs-style  notation  is  used  to
       denote  keystrokes.   Control  keys  are denoted by C-_k_e_y,



GNU Bash-2.05a           2001 November 13                      46





BASH(1)                                                   BASH(1)


       e.g., C-n  means  Control-N.   Similarly,  _m_e_t_a  keys  are
       denoted  by  M-_k_e_y,  so  M-x  means Meta-X.  (On keyboards
       without a _m_e_t_a key, M-_x  means  ESC  _x,  i.e.,  press  the
       Escape  key  then the _x key.  This makes ESC the _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_-
       _f_i_x.  The combination M-C-_x means ESC-Control-_x, or  press
       the  Escape  key  then hold the Control key while pressing
       the _x key.)

       Readline commands may be given  numeric  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s,  which
       normally act as a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is
       the sign of the argument that is significant.   Passing  a
       negative  argument  to  a command that acts in the forward
       direction (e.g., kkiillll--lliinnee) causes that command to act  in
       a  backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with argu-
       ments deviates from this are noted below.

       When a command is described  as  _k_i_l_l_i_n_g  text,  the  text
       deleted  is saved for possible future retrieval (_y_a_n_k_i_n_g).
       The killed text is saved  in  a  _k_i_l_l  _r_i_n_g.   Consecutive
       kills  cause  the  text  to  be accumulated into one unit,
       which can be yanked all at once.  Commands  which  do  not
       kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

   RReeaaddlliinnee IInniittiiaalliizzaattiioonn
       Readline  is customized by putting commands in an initial-
       ization file (the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file).  The name of this file is
       taken  from  the  value  of the IINNPPUUTTRRCC variable.  If that
       variable is unset, the default is _~_/_._i_n_p_u_t_r_c.  When a pro-
       gram  which  uses the readline library starts up, the ini-
       tialization file is read, and the key bindings  and  vari-
       ables  are  set.   There  are  only a few basic constructs
       allowed in the readline initialization file.  Blank  lines
       are  ignored.   Lines  beginning  with  a  ## are comments.
       Lines beginning with a $$ indicate conditional  constructs.
       Other lines denote key bindings and variable settings.

       The  default  key-bindings  may be changed with an _i_n_p_u_t_r_c
       file.  Other programs that use this library may add  their
       own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument
       into  the  _i_n_p_u_t_r_c  would  make M-C-u execute the readline
       command _u_n_i_v_e_r_s_a_l_-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

       The following symbolic  character  names  are  recognized:
       _R_U_B_O_U_T,  _D_E_L,  _E_S_C, _L_F_D, _N_E_W_L_I_N_E, _R_E_T, _R_E_T_U_R_N, _S_P_C, _S_P_A_C_E,
       and _T_A_B.

       In addition to command names, readline allows keys  to  be
       bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed

   RReeaaddlliinnee KKeeyy BBiinnddiinnggss
       The syntax for controlling key  bindings  in  the  _i_n_p_u_t_r_c
       file  is  simple.  All that is required is the name of the
       command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which
       it  should  be  bound. The name may be specified in one of
       two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with  _M_e_t_a_-  or
       _C_o_n_t_r_o_l_- prefixes, or as a key sequence.

       When  using  the form kkeeyynnaammee:_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e or _m_a_c_r_o, _k_e_y_-
       _n_a_m_e is the name of a key spelled  out  in  English.   For
       example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In the above example, _C_-_u is bound to the function uunniivveerr--
       ssaall--aarrgguummeenntt,  _M_-_D_E_L  is  bound  to  the  function   bbaacckk--
       wwaarrdd--kkiillll--wwoorrdd,   and  _C_-_o  is  bound  to  run  the  macro
       expressed on the right hand side (that is, to  insert  the
       text ``> output'' into the line).

       In  the second form, ""kkeeyysseeqq"":_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e or _m_a_c_r_o, kkeeyy--
       sseeqq differs from kkeeyynnaammee above in that strings denoting an
       entire  key  sequence  may  be  specified  by  placing the
       sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU Emacs  style  key
       escapes  can be used, as in the following example, but the
       symbolic character names are not recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, _C_-_u is again bound to the  function  uunnii--
       vveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt.    _C_-_x  _C_-_r  is  bound  to  the  function
       rree--rreeaadd--iinniitt--ffiillee, and _E_S_C _[ _1 _1 _~ is bound to insert  the
       text ``Function Key 1''.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is
              \\CC--    control prefix
              \\MM--    meta prefix
              \\ee     an escape character
              \\\\     backslash
              \\""     literal "
              \\''     literal '

       In  addition  to  the  GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a
       second set of backslash escapes is available:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\dd     delete
              \\ff     form feed

                     hexadecimal value _H_H (one or two hex digits)

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes
       must be used to indicate  a  macro  definition.   Unquoted
       text is assumed to be a function name.  In the macro body,
       the backslash escapes described above are expanded.  Back-
       slash  will  quote  any other character in the macro text,
       including " and '.

       BBaasshh allows the current readline key bindings to  be  dis-
       played  or  modified  with  the bbiinndd builtin command.  The
       editing mode may be switched  during  interactive  use  by
       using  the --oo option to the sseett builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       Readline has variables that can be used  to  further  cus-
       tomize its behavior.  A variable may be set in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c
       file with a statement of the form

       Except where noted, readline variables can take the values

              If set to OOnn, readline will convert characters with
              the  eighth  bit  set  to  an ASCII key sequence by
              stripping the eighth bit and  prefixing  an  escape
              character (in effect, using escape as the _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_-

              When set to OOnn, makes readline use  a  single  line
              for  display, scrolling the input horizontally on a
              single screen line when it becomes longer than  the

              If  set to OOnn, readline will enable eight-bit input
              (that is, it will not strip the high bit  from  the
              characters it reads), regardless of what the termi-
              nal claims it can support.  The name mmeettaa--ffllaagg is a

              the  character  as a command.  If this variable has
              not been given a value, the characters _E_S_C and  _C_-_J
              will terminate an incremental search.

              equivalent to _v_i_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d; _e_m_a_c_s  is  equivalent  to

              This  variable,  when set to OOnn, causes readline to
              match files whose names begin with  a  `.'  (hidden
              files)  when performing filename completion, unless
              the leading `.' is supplied  by  the  user  in  the
              filename to be completed.

              If set to OOnn, readline will display characters with

              If  set  to  OOnn,  readline will display completions
              with matches sorted  horizontally  in  alphabetical

              This  alters the default behavior of the completion
              functions.  If set to oonn,  words  which  have  more
              than  one  possible completion cause the matches to
              be listed immediately instead of ringing the  bell.

              If set to OOnn, a character denoting a file's type as
              reported by _s_t_a_t(2) is  appended  to  the  filename
              when listing possible completions.

       Readline  implements  a  facility similar in spirit to the
       conditional compilation features  of  the  C  preprocessor
       which allows key bindings and variable settings to be per-
       formed as the result of  tests.   There  are  four  parser
       directives used.

       $$iiff    The  $$iiff construct allows bindings to be made based
              on the editing mode, the terminal  being  used,  or
              the  application  using  readline.  The text of the
              test extends to the end of the line; no  characters
              are required to isolate it.

              mmooddee   The  mmooddee== form of the $$iiff directive is used
                     to test whether readline is in emacs  or  vi
                     mode.   This may be used in conjunction with
                     the sseett kkeeyymmaapp command, for instance, to set
                     bindings    in    the   _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d   and
                     _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x  keymaps  only  if  readline   is
                     starting out in emacs mode.

              tteerrmm   The tteerrmm== form may be used to include termi-
                     nal-specific key bindings, perhaps  to  bind
                     the  key  sequences output by the terminal's
                     function keys.  The word on the  right  side
                     of  the  ==  is  tested against the both full

                     terminal  name  before  the  first  --.  This
                     allows _s_u_n to match both  _s_u_n  and  _s_u_n_-_c_m_d,
                     for instance.

              aapppplliiccaattiioonn
                     The aapppplliiccaattiioonn construct is used to include
                     application-specific settings.  Each program
                     using the readline library sets the _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_-
                     _t_i_o_n _n_a_m_e, and an  initialization  file  can
                     test  for a particular value.  This could be
                     used to bind key sequences to functions use-
                     ful  for  a specific program.  For instance,
                     the following command adds  a  key  sequence
                     that  quotes the current or previous word in
                     Bash:

                     $$iiff Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     $$eennddiiff

       $$eennddiiff This command, as seen in the previous example, ter-
              minates an $$iiff command.

       $$eellssee  Commands  in  this  branch of the $$iiff directive are
              executed if the test fails.

       $$iinncclluuddee
              This directive takes a single filename as an  argu-
              ment  and  reads  commands  and  bindings from that
              file.  For example, the following  directive  would
              read _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c:

              $$iinncclluuddee  _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c

   SSeeaarrcchhiinngg
       Readline  provides commands for searching through the com-
       mand history (see HHIISSTTOORRYY below) for  lines  containing  a
       specified string.  There are two search modes: _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l
       and _n_o_n_-_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l.

       Incremental searches begin before the  user  has  finished
       typing the search string.  As each character of the search
       string is typed, readline displays the next entry from the
       history  matching the string typed so far.  An incremental
       search requires only as many characters as needed to  find
       the  desired history entry.  The characters present in the
       value of the iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss variable are used to ter-
       minate  an  incremental  search.  If that variable has not
       been assigned a value the Escape and Control-J  characters
       will  terminate  an  incremental  search.   Control-G will
       abort an incremental search and restore the original line.
       When   the   search   is  terminated,  the  history  entry

       containing the search string becomes the current line.

       To find other matching entries in the history  list,  type
       Control-S  or  Control-R as appropriate.  This will search
       backward or forward in the  history  for  the  next  entry
       matching  the  search  string typed so far.  Any other key
       sequence bound to a readline command  will  terminate  the
       search  and execute that command.  For instance, a _n_e_w_l_i_n_e
       will terminate the search and  accept  the  line,  thereby
       executing the command from the history list.

       Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If
       two Control-Rs are typed without any  intervening  charac-
       ters  defining  a new search string, any remembered search
       string is used.

       Non-incremental searches read  the  entire  search  string
       before starting to search for matching history lines.  The
       search string may be typed by the user or be part  of  the
       contents of the current line.

              Add this digit to the argument  already  accumulat-
              ing,  or  start a new argument.  M-- starts a nega-
              tive argument.

              This is another way to  specify  an  argument.   If
              this  command  is  followed  by one or more digits,
              optionally with a leading minus sign, those  digits
              define the argument.  If the command is followed by
              digits, executing uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt again ends the
              numeric  argument,  but is otherwise ignored.  As a
              special case, if this command is  immediately  fol-
              lowed  by  a  character  that is neither a digit or
              minus sign, the argument count for the next command
              is  multiplied by four.  The argument count is ini-
              tially one, so executing this  function  the  first
              time  makes  the argument count four, a second time
              makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.

   PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn
       When word completion is attempted for  an  argument  to  a
       command  for which a completion specification (a _c_o_m_p_s_p_e_c)
       has been defined using the  ccoommpplleettee  builtin  (see  SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN   CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  below),  the  programmable  completion
       facilities are invoked.

       First, the command name is identified.  If a compspec  has
       been  defined  for  that  command, the compspec is used to
       generate the list of possible completions  for  the  word.
       If the command word is a full pathname, a compspec for the
       full pathname is searched for first.  If  no  compspec  is
       found  for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a
       compspec for the portion following the final slash.

       Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the
       list  of  matching words.  If a compspec is not found, the
       default bbaasshh completion as described above under  CCoommpplleett--
       iinngg is performed.

       First,  the  actions  specified  by the compspec are used.
       Only matches which are prefixed by  the  word  being  com-
       pleted are returned.  When the --ff or --dd option is used for
       filename or directory name completion, the shell  variable
       FFIIGGNNOORREE is used to filter the matches.

       Any  completions specified by a filename expansion pattern
       to the --GG option are generated next.  The words  generated
       by  the  pattern  need not match the word being completed.
       The GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE shell variable is not used  to  filter  the
       matches, but the FFIIGGNNOORREE variable is used.

       Next,  the  string  specified  as  the  argument to the --WW
       option is considered.  The string is first split using the
       characters  in  the  IIFFSS  special  variable as delimiters.
       Shell quoting is honored.   Each  word  is  then  expanded
       using  brace  expansion,  tilde  expansion,  parameter and
       variable  expansion,  command   substitution,   arithmetic
       expansion,  and  pathname  expansion,  as  described above
       under EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN.  The results are split  using  the  rules
       described  above under WWoorrdd SSpplliittttiinngg.  The results of the
       expansion are prefix-matched against the word  being  com-
       pleted, and the matching words become the possible comple-
       tions.

       After these matches have been generated, any  shell  func-
       tion  or  command  specified with the --FF and --CC options is
       invoked.  When the command or  function  is  invoked,  the
       CCOOMMPP__LLIINNEE  and CCOOMMPP__PPOOIINNTT variables are assigned values as
       described above under SShheellll VVaarriiaabblleess.  If a  shell  func-
       tion is being invoked, the CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDSS and CCOOMMPP__CCWWOORRDD vari-
       ables are also set.   When  the  function  or  command  is
       invoked,  the  first  argument  is the name of the command
       whose arguments are being completed, the  second  argument
       is the word being completed, and the third argument is the
       word preceding the word being  completed  on  the  current
       command  line.   No filtering of the generated completions
       against the word being completed is performed;  the  func-
       tion  or  command  has  complete freedom in generating the
       matches.

       Any function specified with  --FF  is  invoked  first.   The
       function  may  use  any of the shell facilities, including
       the ccoommppggeenn  builtin  described  below,  to  generate  the
       matches.  It must put the possible completions in the CCOOMM--
       PPRREEPPLLYY array variable.

       Next, any command specified with the --CC option is  invoked
       in  an environment equivalent to command substitution.  It
       should print a list of completions, one per line,  to  the
       standard  output.   Backslash may be used to escape a new-
       line, if necessary.

       After all of the possible completions are  generated,  any

       filter  specified  with  the  --XX  option is applied to the
       list.  The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expan-
       sion;  a && in the pattern is replaced with the text of the
       word being completed.  A literal && may be escaped  with  a
       backslash;  the  backslash  is removed before attempting a
       match.  Any completion that matches the  pattern  will  be
       removed  from  the list.  A leading !! negates the pattern;
       in this case any completion not matching the pattern  will
       be removed.

       Finally,  any  prefix and suffix specified with the --PP and
       --SS options are added to  each  member  of  the  completion
       list,  and  the result is returned to the readline comple-
       tion code as the list of possible completions.

       If the previously-applied  actions  do  not  generate  any
       matches,  and  the --oo ddiirrnnaammeess option was supplied to ccoomm--
       pplleettee when the compspec was defined, directory  name  com-
       pletion is attempted.

       By  default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates
       is returned to the completion code as the full set of pos-
       sible  completions.   The default bbaasshh completions are not
       attempted, and the readline default of filename completion
       is  disabled.   If  the  --oo ddeeffaauulltt option was supplied to
       ccoommpplleettee when the compspec was defined, readline's default
       completion  will be performed if the compspec generates no
       matches.

HHIISSTTOORRYY
       When the --oo hhiissttoorryy option to the sseett builtin is  enabled,
       the shell provides access to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _h_i_s_t_o_r_y, the list
       of commands previously typed.  The value of  the  HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE
       variable  is  used  as the number of commands to save in a
       history list.  The text  of  the  last  HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE  commands
       (default  500) is saved.  The shell stores each command in
       the history list prior to parameter and variable expansion
       (see  EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN above) but after history expansion is per-
       formed, subject to  the  values  of  the  shell  variables
       HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE and HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL.

       On startup, the history is initialized from the file named
       by the variable HHIISSTTFFIILLEE (default  _~_/_._b_a_s_h___h_i_s_t_o_r_y).   The
       file  named by the value of HHIISSTTFFIILLEE is truncated, if nec-
       essary, to contain no more than the number of lines speci-
       fied  by  the  value of HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE.  When an interactive
       shell exits, the last $$HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE lines are copied from  the
       history list to $$HHIISSTTFFIILLEE.  If the hhiissttaappppeenndd shell option
       is enabled (see  the  description  of  sshhoopptt  under  SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  below),  the  lines are appended to the
       history file, otherwise the history file  is  overwritten.
       If   HHIISSTTFFIILLEE   is  unset,  or  if  the  history  file  is
       unwritable, the history is not saved.   After  saving  the
       history,  the history file is truncated to contain no more

       than HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE lines.  If HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE is not  set,  no
       truncation is performed.

       The  builtin command ffcc (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below)
       may be used to list or edit and re-execute  a  portion  of
       the history list.  The hhiissttoorryy builtin may be used to dis-
       play or modify the history list and manipulate the history
       file.   When  using  command-line editing, search commands
       are available in each editing mode that provide access  to
       the history list.

       The  shell allows control over which commands are saved on
       the history list.  The HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL  and  HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE  vari-
       ables  may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset
       of the commands entered.  The  ccmmddhhiisstt  shell  option,  if
       enabled,  causes the shell to attempt to save each line of
       a multi-line command in the  same  history  entry,  adding
       semicolons  where necessary to preserve syntactic correct-
       ness.  The lliitthhiisstt shell option causes the shell  to  save
       the  command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.
       See the description of the sshhoopptt builtin below under SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS for information on setting and unsetting
       shell options.

HHIISSTTOORRYY EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       The shell supports a history  expansion  feature  that  is
       similar  to  the  history  expansion in ccsshh..  This section
       describes what syntax features are available.   This  fea-
       ture is enabled by default for interactive shells, and can
       be disabled using the ++HH option to the sseett builtin command
       (see   SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  below).   Non-interactive
       shells do not perform history expansion by default.

       History expansions introduce words from the  history  list
       into  the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands,
       insert the arguments to a previous command into  the  cur-
       rent  input  line,  or  fix  errors  in  previous commands
       quickly.

       History expansion is performed immediately  after  a  com-
       plete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words.
       It takes place in two parts.  The first  is  to  determine
       which  line  from the history list to use during substitu-
       tion.  The second is to select portions of that  line  for
       inclusion  into  the  current one.  The line selected from
       the history is the _e_v_e_n_t, and the portions  of  that  line
       that  are  acted  upon  are  _w_o_r_d_s.  Various _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s are
       available to manipulate the selected words.  The  line  is
       broken  into  words  in  the  same fashion as when reading
       input, so that several _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r-separated words  sur-
       rounded by quotes are considered one word.  History expan-
       sions are introduced by  the  appearance  of  the  history
       expansion  character,  which  is !! by default.  Only back-
       slash  (\\)  and  single  quotes  can  quote  the   history

       expansion character.

       Several  shell options settable with the sshhoopptt builtin may
       be used to tailor the behavior of history  expansion.   If
       the  hhiissttvveerriiffyy  shell option is enabled (see the descrip-
       tion of the sshhoopptt builtin), and rreeaaddlliinnee  is  being  used,
       history  substitutions  are  not immediately passed to the
       shell parser.  Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into
       the  rreeaaddlliinnee editing buffer for further modification.  If
       rreeaaddlliinnee is being used, and the hhiissttrreeeeddiitt shell option is
       enabled,  a  failed  history substitution will be reloaded
       into the rreeaaddlliinnee editing buffer for correction.   The  --pp
       option  to  the hhiissttoorryy builtin command may be used to see
       what a history expansion will do before using it.  The  --ss
       option  to the hhiissttoorryy builtin may be used to add commands
       to the end of the history list without actually  executing
       them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.

       The shell allows control of the various characters used by
       the history expansion mechanism (see  the  description  of
       hhiissttcchhaarrss above under SShheellll VVaarriiaabblleess).

       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry
       in the history list.

       !!      Start a history substitution, except when  followed
              by a bbllaannkk, newline, = or (.
       !!_n     Refer to command line _n.
       !!--_n    Refer to the current command line minus _n.
       !!!!     Refer  to  the previous command.  This is a synonym
              for `!-1'.
       !!_s_t_r_i_n_g
              Refer to the  most  recent  command  starting  with

       !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]
              Refer to the most recent command containing _s_t_r_i_n_g.
              The trailing ?? may be omitted if _s_t_r_i_n_g is followed
              immediately by a newline.
       ^^_s_t_r_i_n_g_1^^_s_t_r_i_n_g_2^^
              Quick   substitution.   Repeat  the  last  command,
              replacing  _s_t_r_i_n_g_1  with  _s_t_r_i_n_g_2.   Equivalent  to
              ``!!:s/_s_t_r_i_n_g_1/_s_t_r_i_n_g_2/'' (see MMooddiiffiieerrss below).

       Word designators are used to select desired words from the
       event.  A :: separates the  event  specification  from  the
       word designator.  It may be omitted if the word designator
       begins with a ^^, $$, **, --, or %%.  Words are  numbered  from
       the  beginning  of  the  line,  with  the first word being
       denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the  current
       line separated by single spaces.

       00 ((zzeerroo))
              The  zeroth  word.  For the shell, this is the com-
              mand word.
       _n      The _nth word.
       ^^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
       $$      The last argument.
       %%      The word matched  by  the  most  recent  `?_s_t_r_i_n_g?'
              search.
       _x--_y    A range of words; `-_y' abbreviates `0-_y'.
       **      All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym
              for `_1_-_$'.  It is not an error to use ** if there is
              just  one  word  in  the event; the empty string is
              returned in that case.
       xx**     Abbreviates _x_-_$.
       xx--     Abbreviates _x_-_$ like xx**, but omits the last word.

       If a word designator is supplied without an event specifi-
       cation, the previous command is used as the event.

       After  the  optional  word  designator, there may appear a
       sequence of one or more of the following  modifiers,  each
       preceded by a `:'.

       hh      Remove a trailing file name component, leaving only
              the head.
       tt      Remove all leading file  name  components,  leaving
              the tail.
       rr      Remove  a trailing suffix of the form _._x_x_x, leaving
              the basename.
       ee      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       pp      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       qq      Quote the substituted words, escaping further  sub-
              stitutions.
       xx      Quote  the  substituted  words as with qq, but break
              into words at bbllaannkkss and newlines.
       ss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//
              Substitute _n_e_w for the first occurrence of  _o_l_d  in
              the event line.  Any delimiter can be used in place
              of /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the
              last  character  of  the event line.  The delimiter
              may be quoted in _o_l_d and _n_e_w with  a  single  back-
              slash.  If & appears in _n_e_w, it is replaced by _o_l_d.
              A single backslash will quote the  &.   If  _o_l_d  is
              null, it is set to the last _o_l_d substituted, or, if
              no previous history substitutions took  place,  the
              last _s_t_r_i_n_g in a !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]  search.
       &&      Repeat the previous substitution.
       gg      Cause  changes  to be applied over the entire event
              line.  This is used in conjunction with `::ss' (e.g.,
              `::ggss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//')  or  `::&&'.   If used with `::ss', any
              delimiter can be used in place of /, and the  final
              delimiter  is  optional if it is the last character
              of the event line.

              Execute  the  specified  shell  builtin, passing it
              _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, and return its  exit  status.   This  is
              useful  when  defining a function whose name is the
              same as a shell builtin, retaining the  functional-
              ity  of  the  builtin  within the function.  The ccdd
              builtin is commonly redefined this way.  The return
              status  is  false  if  _s_h_e_l_l_-_b_u_i_l_t_i_n is not a shell
              builtin command.

       ccdd [--LLPP] [_d_i_r]
              Change the current directory to _d_i_r.  The  variable
              HHOOMMEE  is  the  default  _d_i_r.   The  variable CCDDPPAATTHH
              defines the search path for the directory  contain-
              ing _d_i_r.  Alternative directory names in CCDDPPAATTHH are
              separated by a colon (:).  A null directory name in
              CCDDPPAATTHH  is the same as the current directory, i.e.,
              ``..''.  If _d_i_r begins with a slash (/), then CCDDPPAATTHH
              is not used. The --PP option says to use the physical
              directory structure instead of  following  symbolic
              links  (see  also  the --PP option to the sseett builtin
              command); the --LL option forces symbolic links to be
              followed.   An argument of -- is equivalent to $$OOLLDD--
              PPWWDD.  The return value is true if the directory was
              successfully changed; false otherwise.

       ccoommmmaanndd [--ppVVvv] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g ...]
              Run  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d with _a_r_g_s suppressing the normal shell
              function lookup. Only builtin commands or  commands
              found  in  the PPAATTHH are executed.  If the --pp option
              is given, the search for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is performed using
              a default value for PPAATTHH that is guaranteed to find
              all of the standard utilities.  If either the --VV or
              --vv  option is supplied, a description of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
              printed.  The --vv option causes a single word  indi-
              cating the command or file name used to invoke _c_o_m_-
              _m_a_n_d to be displayed; the --VV option produces a more
              verbose  description.   If  the  --VV or --vv option is
              supplied, the exit  status  is  0  if  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  was
              found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied
              and an error occurred or _c_o_m_m_a_n_d cannot  be  found,
              the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status
              of the ccoommmmaanndd builtin is the exit status  of  _c_o_m_-
              _m_a_n_d.

       ccoommppggeenn [_o_p_t_i_o_n] [_w_o_r_d]
              Generate   possible  completion  matches  for  _w_o_r_d
              according to the _o_p_t_i_o_ns, which may be  any  option
              accepted by the ccoommpplleettee builtin with the exception
              of --pp and --rr, and write the matches to the standard
              output.  When using the --FF or --CC options, the vari-
              ous shell variables set by the programmable comple-
              tion  facilities,  while  available,  will not have
              useful values.

              The matches will be generated in the same way as if
              the programmable completion code had generated them
              directly from a completion specification  with  the
              same  flags.  If _w_o_r_d is specified, only those com-
              pletions matching _w_o_r_d will be displayed.

              The return value is true unless an  invalid  option
              is supplied, or no matches were generated.

              Specify how arguments to each _n_a_m_e should  be  com-
              pleted.   If  the  --pp  option is supplied, or if no
              options are supplied, existing completion  specifi-
              cations are printed in a way that allows them to be
              reused as input.  The --rr option removes  a  comple-
              tion  specification  for each _n_a_m_e, or, if no _n_a_m_es
              are supplied, all completion specifications.

              The process of applying these completion specifica-
              tions   when   word   completion  is  attempted  is
              described above under PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn.

              Other options, if  specified,  have  the  following
              meanings.   The  arguments  to  the  --GG, --WW, and --XX
              options (and, if necessary, the --PP and --SS  options)
              should  be  quoted  to  protect them from expansion
              before the ccoommpplleettee builtin is invoked.

                      The _c_o_m_p_-_o_p_t_i_o_n controls several aspects of
                      the  compspec's  behavior beyond the simple

                      The  _w_o_r_d_l_i_s_t is split using the characters
                      in the IIFFSS special variable as  delimiters,
                      and  each  resultant word is expanded.  The
                      possible completions are the members of the
                      resultant  list  which match the word being

                      _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed in a subshell  environ-
                      ment,  and its output is used as the possi-

                      The shell function _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n is executed  in
                      the  current  shell  environment.   When it
                      finishes,  the  possible  completions   are
                      retrieved  from  the value of the CCOOMMPPRREEPPLLYY

                      _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is a pattern as used for filename
                      expansion.   It  is  applied to the list of
                      possible completions generated by the  pre-
                      ceding options and arguments, and each com-
                      pletion matching _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is removed  from
                      the list.  A leading !! in _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t negates
                      the pattern; in this case,  any  completion
                      not matching _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is removed.

                      _p_r_e_f_i_x  is  added  at the beginning of each
                      possible completion after all other options
                      have been applied.

                      tion after  all  other  options  have  been
                      applied.

              The  return  value is true unless an invalid option

              and  values  of  each _n_a_m_e.  When --pp is used, addi-
              tional options are ignored.  The --FF option inhibits
              the display of function definitions; only the func-
              tion name  and  attributes  are  printed.   The  --FF
              option  implies  --ff.   The following options can be
              used to restrict output to variables with the spec-
              ified attribute or to give variables attributes:
              --aa     Each  _n_a_m_e  is an array variable (see AArrrraayyss
                     above).
              --ff     Use function names only.
              --ii     The  variable  is  treated  as  an  integer;
                     arithmetic evaluation (see AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUU--
                     AATTIIOONN )) is performed when  the  variable  is
                     assigned a value.
              --rr     Make  _n_a_m_es  readonly.   These  names cannot
                     then  be  assigned  values   by   subsequent
                     assignment statements or unset.
              --xx     Mark _n_a_m_es for export to subsequent commands
                     via the environment.

              Using `+' instead of `-' turns  off  the  attribute
              instead, with the exception that ++aa may not be used
              to destroy an array variable.  When used in a func-
              tion, makes each _n_a_m_e local, as with the llooccaall com-

              a  single  line  with  directory names separated by
              spaces.  Directories are added to the list with the
              ppuusshhdd  command;  the  ppooppdd  command removes entries
              from the list.
              ++_n     Displays the _nth  entry  counting  from  the
                     left  of the list shown by ddiirrss when invoked

              table  of  active jobs.  If the --hh option is given,
              each _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is not removed from the table, but  is
              marked so that SSIIGGHHUUPP is not sent to the job if the

              the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b is used.  If  no  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  is  sup-
              plied,  the  --aa  option means to remove or mark all
              jobs; the --rr  option  without  a  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  argument
              restricts  operation  to  running jobs.  The return
              value is 0 unless a  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c  does  not  specify  a
              valid job.

              specified,  the trailing newline is suppressed.  If
              the --ee option is given, interpretation of the  fol-
              lowing  backslash-escaped  characters  is  enabled.
              The --EE option disables the interpretation of  these
              escape  characters,  even on systems where they are
              interpreted by default.  The xxppgg__eecchhoo shell  option
              may be used to dynamically determine whether or not
              eecchhoo expands these escape  characters  by  default.
              eecchhoo  does  not  interpret  ----  to  mean the end of

              Enable and disable builtin  shell  commands.   Dis-
              abling  a  builtin  allows a disk command which has
              the same name as a shell  builtin  to  be  executed
              without specifying a full pathname, even though the
              shell normally searches for  builtins  before  disk
              commands.   If  --nn  is used, each _n_a_m_e is disabled;
              otherwise, _n_a_m_e_s are enabled.  For example, to  use
              the  tteesstt  binary found via the PPAATTHH instead of the
              shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.  The

              _n_a_m_e from shared object _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, on  systems  that
              support dynamic loading.  The --dd option will delete
              a builtin previously loaded with --ff.   If  no  _n_a_m_e
              arguments  are  given,  or if the --pp option is sup-
              plied, a list of shell builtins is  printed.   With
              no other option arguments, the list consists of all
              enabled shell builtins.  If --nn  is  supplied,  only
              disabled  builtins are printed.  If --aa is supplied,
              the list printed includes  all  builtins,  with  an
              indication  of  whether or not each is enabled.  If
              --ss is supplied, the output  is  restricted  to  the
              POSIX  _s_p_e_c_i_a_l  builtins.   The  return  value is 0

              single command.  This command is then read and exe-
              cuted by the shell, and its exit status is returned
              as the value of eevvaall.  If there  are  no  _a_r_g_s,  or
              only null arguments, eevvaall returns 0.

              If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, it replaces the shell.  No
              new process is created.  The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s  become  the
              arguments  to  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.   If  the --ll option is sup-
              plied, the shell places a dash at the beginning  of
              the  zeroth  arg  passed  to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  This is what
              _l_o_g_i_n(1) does.  The --cc option causes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to  be
              executed  with an empty environment.  If --aa is sup-
              plied, the shell passes _n_a_m_e as the zeroth argument
              to the executed command.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d cannot be exe-
              cuted for  some  reason,  a  non-interactive  shell
              exits, unless the shell option eexxeeccffaaiill is enabled,
              in which case it returns failure.   An  interactive
              shell  returns  failure  if the file cannot be exe-
              cuted.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is not specified,  any  redirec-
              tions  take  effect  in  the current shell, and the
              return status is 0.   If  there  is  a  redirection
              error, the return status is 1.

              before the shell terminates.

       eexxppoorrtt --pp
              The supplied _n_a_m_e_s are marked for automatic  export
              to  the  environment  of subsequently executed com-
              mands.  If the --ff option is given, the _n_a_m_e_s  refer
              to  functions.  If no _n_a_m_e_s are given, or if the --pp
              option is supplied, a list of all  names  that  are
              exported  in  this shell is printed.  The --nn option
              causes the export property to be removed  from  the
              named  variables.  eexxppoorrtt returns an exit status of
              0 unless an invalid option is encountered,  one  of
              the _n_a_m_e_s is not a valid shell variable name, or --ff
              is supplied with a _n_a_m_e that is not a function.

              Fix Command.  In the first form, a  range  of  com-
              mands  from _f_i_r_s_t to _l_a_s_t is selected from the his-
              tory list.  _F_i_r_s_t and _l_a_s_t may be  specified  as  a
              string  (to  locate the last command beginning with
              that string) or as a number (an index into the his-
              tory  list,  where  a negative number is used as an
              offset from the current command number).   If  _l_a_s_t
              is  not  specified it is set to the current command
              for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the  last
              10  commands)  and to _f_i_r_s_t otherwise.  If _f_i_r_s_t is
              not specified it is set to the previous command for
              editing and -16 for listing.

              The  --nn  option suppresses the command numbers when
              listing.  The --rr option reverses the order  of  the
              commands.   If the --ll option is given, the commands
              are listed on standard output.  Otherwise, the edi-
              tor  given by _e_n_a_m_e is invoked on a file containing
              those commands.  If _e_n_a_m_e is not given,  the  value
              of  the  FFCCEEDDIITT  variable is used, and the value of
              EEDDIITTOORR if FFCCEEDDIITT is not set.  If  neither  variable
              is  set, _v_i is used.  When editing is complete, the
              edited commands are echoed and executed.

              In the second form, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  is  re-executed  after
              each  instance of _p_a_t is replaced by _r_e_p.  A useful
              alias to use with this is ``r=fc -s'', so that typ-
              ing  ``r  cc'' runs the last command beginning with
              ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the  last  com-
              mand.

              If  the  first  form is used, the return value is 0

              shell's notion of the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t  _j_o_b  is  used.   The
              return value is that of the command placed into the
              foreground, or failure if run when job  control  is
              disabled  or, when run with job control enabled, if
              _j_o_b_s_p_e_c does not specify a  valid  job  or  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c

              ggeettooppttss is used by shell procedures to parse  posi-
              tional  parameters.   _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g contains the option
              characters to be recognized; if a character is fol-
              lowed by a colon, the option is expected to have an
              argument, which should  be  separated  from  it  by
              white  space.   The colon and question mark charac-
              ters may not be used as  option  characters.   Each
              time  it is invoked, ggeettooppttss places the next option
              in the shell variable _n_a_m_e, initializing _n_a_m_e if it
              does  not exist, and the index of the next argument
              to be processed into the variable  OOPPTTIINNDD.   OOPPTTIINNDD
              is  initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell
              script is invoked.   When  an  option  requires  an
              argument,  ggeettooppttss  places  that  argument into the
              variable OOPPTTAARRGG.  The shell does not  reset  OOPPTTIINNDD
              automatically;  it  must  be manually reset between
              multiple calls to ggeettooppttss  within  the  same  shell
              invocation  if  a  new  set  of parameters is to be
              used.

              When the end of  options  is  encountered,  ggeettooppttss
              exits  with  a  return  value  greater  than  zero.
              OOPPTTIINNDD is set to the index of the first  non-option
              argument, and nnaammee is set to ?.

              ggeettooppttss  normally parses the positional parameters,
              but if more arguments are given  in  _a_r_g_s,  ggeettooppttss
              parses those instead.

              ggeettooppttss  can  report  errors  in  two ways.  If the
              first character of _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g  is  a  colon,  _s_i_l_e_n_t
              error  reporting  is  used.   In  normal  operation

              diagnostic  messages  are  printed   when   invalid
              options  or  missing  option  arguments are encoun-
              tered.  If the variable OOPPTTEERRRR  is  set  to  0,  no
              error messages will be displayed, even if the first
              character of _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, ggeettooppttss places ? into
              _n_a_m_e  and,  if  not silent, prints an error message
              and unsets  OOPPTTAARRGG.   If  ggeettooppttss  is  silent,  the
              option  character  found is placed in OOPPTTAARRGG and no
              diagnostic message is printed.

              If a required argument is not found, and ggeettooppttss is
              not  silent, a question mark (??) is placed in _n_a_m_e,
              OOPPTTAARRGG  is  unset,  and  a  diagnostic  message  is
              printed.  If ggeettooppttss is silent, then a colon (::) is
              placed in _n_a_m_e and OOPPTTAARRGG  is  set  to  the  option
              character found.

              ggeettooppttss  returns  true  if  an option, specified or
              unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the end
              of options is encountered or an error occurs.

              For each _n_a_m_e, the full file name of the command is
              determined by searching the  directories  in  $$PPAATTHH
              and  remembered.   If the --pp option is supplied, no
              path search is performed, and _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is  used  as
              the  full  file name of the command.  The --rr option
              causes the shell to  forget  all  remembered  loca-

              pathname to which each _n_a_m_e corresponds is printed.

              either a signal name such as SSIIGGKKIILLLL  or  a  signal
              number; _s_i_g_n_u_m is a signal number.  If _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is a
              signal name, the name may be given with or  without
              the  SSIIGG  prefix.   If _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is not present, then
              SSIIGGTTEERRMM is assumed.  An argument of  --ll  lists  the
              signal  names.   If any arguments are supplied when
              --ll is given, the names of the signals corresponding
              to  the arguments are listed, and the return status
              is 0.  The _e_x_i_t___s_t_a_t_u_s argument to --ll is  a  number

              For each argument, a local variable named  _n_a_m_e  is
              created, and assigned _v_a_l_u_e.  The _o_p_t_i_o_n can be any

              Arguments,  if  supplied,  have the following mean-
              ings:
              ++_n     Removes the _nth entry counting from the left
                     of  the  list  shown  by ddiirrss, starting with
                     zero.  For example: ``popd +0'' removes  the
                     first directory, ``popd +1'' the second.
              --_n     Removes  the  _nth  entry  counting  from the
                     right of the list shown  by  ddiirrss,  starting
                     with zero.  For example: ``popd -0'' removes
                     the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next  to
                     last.
              --nn     Suppresses  the  normal  change of directory
                     when removing directories from the stack, so
                     that only the stack is manipulated.

              If  the  ppooppdd command is successful, a ddiirrss is per-
              formed as well, and the return status is  0.   ppooppdd
              returns  false if an invalid option is encountered,
              the directory stack is empty, a non-existent direc-
              tory  stack  entry  is  specified, or the directory
              change fails.

              put under the control of the _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The _f_o_r_m_a_t is
              a character string which contains  three  types  of
              objects:  plain characters, which are simply copied
              to standard  output,  character  escape  sequences,
              which are converted and copied to the standard out-
              put,  and  format  specifications,  each  of  which
              causes  printing  of  the next successive _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.
              In addition to the standard _p_r_i_n_t_f(1)  formats,  %%bb
              causes  pprriinnttff to expand backslash escape sequences
              in the corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t, and %%qq causes pprriinnttff
              to  output  the  corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t in a format
              that can be reused as shell input.

              The _f_o_r_m_a_t is reused as necessary to consume all of
              the  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s.   If the _f_o_r_m_a_t requires more _a_r_g_u_-
              _m_e_n_t_s than are supplied, the extra format  specifi-
              cations  behave  as if a zero value or null string,
              as appropriate,  had  been  supplied.   The  return
              value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.

              Without options, the name and value of  each  shell
              variable  are  displayed  in  a  format that can be
              reused as input.  The output is sorted according to
              the  current  locale.   When options are specified,
              they set or unset shell attributes.  Any  arguments
              remaining  after  the  options  are  processed  are
              treated as values for the positional parameters and
              are  assigned,  in  order,  to  $$11,  $$22,  ......   $$_n.
              Options, if specified, have the following meanings:
              --aa      Automatically  mark variables and functions
                      which are modified or created for export to
                      the environment of subsequent commands.
              --bb      Report  the status of terminated background
                      jobs immediately, rather  than  before  the
                      next  primary  prompt.   This  is effective
                      only when job control is enabled.
              --ee      Exit immediately if a _s_i_m_p_l_e  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  (see
                      SSHHEELLLL  GGRRAAMMMMAARR above) exits with a non-zero
                      status.  The shell does  not  exit  if  the
                      command  that  fails is part of an _u_n_t_i_l or
                      _w_h_i_l_e loop, part of an _i_f  statement,  part
                      of  a  &&&&  or  |||| list, or if the command's
                      return value is being inverted  via  !!.   A
                      trap on EERRRR, if set, is executed before the
                      shell exits.
              --ff      Disable pathname expansion.
              --hh      Remember the location of commands  as  they
                      are  looked  up  for  execution.   This  is
                      enabled by default.
              --kk      All arguments in  the  form  of  assignment
                      statements  are  placed  in the environment
                      for a command, not just those that  precede
                      the command name.
              --mm      Monitor  mode.   Job  control  is  enabled.
                      This option is on by default  for  interac-
                      tive shells on systems that support it (see
                      JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL above).   Background  processes
                      run  in a separate process group and a line
                      containing their  exit  status  is  printed
                      upon their completion.
              --nn      Read  commands  but  do  not  execute them.
                      This may be used to check  a  shell  script
                      for  syntax  errors.   This  is  ignored by
                      interactive shells.

                     If the first argument is exactly ((  and  the

              The command _a_r_g is to be read and executed when the
              shell receives signal(s) _s_i_g_s_p_e_c.  If _a_r_g is absent
              or --, all specified  signals  are  reset  to  their
              original  values (the values they had upon entrance
              to the shell).  If _a_r_g is the null string the  sig-
              nal  specified  by  each  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is ignored by the

              commands associated  with  each  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  are  dis-
              played.  If no arguments are supplied or if only --pp
              is given, ttrraapp prints the list of commands  associ-
              ated  with  each  signal  number.   Each _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is

              a _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is EERRRR, the command _a_r_g is executed when-
              ever a simple command has a non-zero  exit  status.
              The  EERRRR trap is not executed if the failed command
              is part of an _u_n_t_i_l or _w_h_i_l_e loop, part  of  an  _i_f
              statement,  part of a &&&& or |||| list, or if the com-
              mand's return value is being inverted via  !!.   The
              --ll  option causes the shell to print a list of sig-
              nal names and their corresponding numbers.  Signals
              ignored  upon  entry to the shell cannot be trapped
              or reset.  Trapped signals are reset to their orig-
              inal  values in a child process when it is created.
              The return  status  is  false  if  any  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  is
              invalid; otherwise ttrraapp returns true.

       ttyyppee [--aattpp] _n_a_m_e [_n_a_m_e ...]
              With  no  options,  indicate how each _n_a_m_e would be
              interpreted if used as a command name.  If  the  --tt
              option  is  used, ttyyppee prints a string which is one
              of _a_l_i_a_s, _k_e_y_w_o_r_d, _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n, _b_u_i_l_t_i_n,  or  _f_i_l_e  if
              _n_a_m_e  is  an  alias, shell reserved word, function,
              builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If  the  _n_a_m_e
              is  not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit
              status of false is returned.  If the --pp  option  is
              used, ttyyppee either returns the name of the disk file
              that would be executed if _n_a_m_e were specified as  a
              command  name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would
              not return _f_i_l_e.  If a command is hashed, --pp prints
              the  hashed  value,  not  necessarily the file that
              appears first in PPAATTHH.  If the --aa option  is  used,
              ttyyppee  prints all of the places that contain an exe-
              cutable named  _n_a_m_e.   This  includes  aliases  and
              functions, if and only if the --pp option is not also
              used.  The table of hashed  commands  is  not  con-
              sulted  when using --aa.  ttyyppee returns true if any of
              the arguments are found, false if none are found.

              Provides control over the  resources  available  to
              the  shell  and to processes started by it, on sys-
              tems that  allow  such  control.   The  --HH  and  --SS
              options  specify that the hard or soft limit is set
              for the given resource.  A  hard  limit  cannot  be
              increased  once  it  is  set;  a  soft limit may be
              increased up to the value of the  hard  limit.   If
              neither  --HH  nor --SS is specified, both the soft and
              hard limits are set.  The value of _l_i_m_i_t can  be  a
              number  in  the  unit specified for the resource or

              given.   When  more than one resource is specified,
              the limit name and  unit  are  printed  before  the
              value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
              --aa     All current limits are reported
              --cc     The maximum size of core files created
              --dd     The maximum size of a process's data segment

              --ll     The  maximum  size  that  may be locked into
                     memory
              --mm     The maximum resident set size
              --nn     The maximum number of open file  descriptors
                     (most  systems do not allow this value to be
                     set)
              --pp     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks  (this  may
                     not be set)
              --ss     The maximum stack size

              --vv     The maximum amount of virtual memory  avail-
                     able to the shell

              If _l_i_m_i_t is given, it is the new value of the spec-
              ified resource (the --aa option is display only).  If
              no option is given, then --ff is assumed.  Values are
              in 1024-byte increments, except for --tt, which is in
              seconds,  --pp, which is in units of 512-byte blocks,
              and --nn and --uu,  which  are  unscaled  values.   The
              return  status  is  0  unless  an invalid option or
              argument is supplied, or an error occurs while set-
              ting a new limit.

              The  user  file-creation  mask  is set to _m_o_d_e.  If
              _m_o_d_e begins with a digit, it is interpreted  as  an
              octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a sym-
              bolic  mode  mask  similar  to  that  accepted   by
              _c_h_m_o_d(1).  If _m_o_d_e is omitted, the current value of
              the mask is printed.  The --SS option causes the mask
              to  be printed in symbolic form; the default output
              is an octal number.  If the --pp option is  supplied,
              and  _m_o_d_e  is omitted, the output is in a form that
              may be reused as input.  The return status is 0  if
              the  mode  was  successfully  changed or if no _m_o_d_e
              argument was supplied, and false otherwise.

              If  --aa  is  supplied,  all  alias  definitions  are
              removed.  The return value is true  unless  a  sup-

       first,  you  should make sure that it really is a bug, and
       that it appears in the latest version  of  bbaasshh  that  you
       have.

       Once  you  have determined that a bug actually exists, use
       the _b_a_s_h_b_u_g command to submit a bug report.  If you have a
       fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well!  Suggestions
       and `philosophical' bug reports  may  be  mailed  to  _b_u_g_-
       _b_a_s_h_@_g_n_u_._o_r_g   or   posted   to   the   Usenet   newsgroup
       ggnnuu..bbaasshh..bbuugg.

       ALL bug reports should include:

       The version number of bbaasshh
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug

       _b_a_s_h_b_u_g inserts the first three items  automatically  into
       the template it provides for filing a bug report.

       Comments  and  bug  reports  concerning  this  manual page
       should be directed to _c_h_e_t_@_i_n_s_._C_W_R_U_._E_d_u.

BBUUGGSS
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between bbaasshh and  tradi-
       tional  versions of sshh, mostly because of the PPOOSSIIXX speci-
       fication.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell  builtin  commands  and  functions  are  not   stop-
       pable/restartable.

       Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b
       ; c' are not handled gracefully when process suspension is
       attempted.   When  a process is stopped, the shell immedi-
       ately executes the next command in the sequence.  It  suf-
       fices  to place the sequence of commands between parenthe-
       ses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a
       unit.

       Commands  inside  of  $$((...))  command substitution are not
       parsed until substitution is attempted.  This  will  delay
       error  reporting  until  some  time  after  the command is
       entered.
