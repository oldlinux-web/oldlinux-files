<p><code><tt>wait</tt> <b>[</b><i>pid</i><tt>...</tt><b>]</b></code></p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_168_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>When an asynchronous list (see <a href="xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_09_03_02"><i>Asynchronous Lists</i></a> ) is started by the
shell, the process ID of the last command in each element of the asynchronous list shall become known in the current shell
execution environment; see <a href="xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_12"><i>Shell Execution Environment</i></a> .</p>

<p>If the <i>wait</i> utility is invoked with no operands, it shall wait until all process IDs known to the invoking shell have
terminated and exit with a zero exit status.</p>

<p>If one or more <i>pid</i> operands are specified that represent known process IDs, the <i>wait</i> utility shall wait until all
of them have terminated. If one or more <i>pid</i> operands are specified that represent unknown process IDs, <i>wait</i> shall
treat them as if they were known process IDs that exited with exit status 127. The exit status returned by the <i>wait</i> utility
shall be the exit status of the process requested by the last <i>pid</i> operand.</p>

<p>The known process IDs are applicable only for invocations of <i>wait</i> in the current shell execution environment.</p>

<p>If one or more operands were specified, all of them have terminated or were not known by the invoking shell, and the status of

indicated by the last operand specified. If the process terminated abnormally due to the receipt of a signal, the exit status shall
be greater than 128 and shall be distinct from the exit status generated by other signals, but the exact value is unspecified. (See
the <a href="../utilities/kill.html"><i>kill</i></a> <b>-l</b> option.) Otherwise, the <i>wait</i> utility shall exit with one of
the following values:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0</dt>

<dd>The <i>wait</i> utility was invoked with no operands and all process IDs known by the invoking shell have terminated.</dd>

<dt>1-126</dt>

<p>Default.</p>

<hr>
<div class="box"><em>The following sections are informative.</em></div>

<h4><a name="tag_04_168_16"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>On most implementations, <i>wait</i> is a shell built-in. If it is called in a subshell or separate utility execution
environment, such as one of the following:</p>

<pre>
<tt>(wait)
nohup wait ...
find . -exec wait ... \;
</tt>
</pre>

<p>it returns immediately because there are no known process IDs to wait for in those environments.</p>

<p>Historical implementations of interactive shells have discarded the exit status of terminated background processes before each
shell prompt. Therefore, the status of background processes was usually lost unless it terminated while <i>wait</i> was waiting for
it. This could be a serious problem when a job that was expected to run for a long time actually terminated quickly with a syntax
or initialization error because the exit status returned was usually zero if the requested process ID was not found. This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the implementation to keep the status of terminated jobs available until the status is
requested, so that scripts like:</p>

<pre>
<tt>j1&amp;
p1=$!
j2&amp;
wait $p1
echo Job 1 exited with status $?
wait $!
echo Job 2 exited with status $?
</tt>
</pre>

<p>work without losing status on any of the jobs. The shell is allowed to discard the status of any process if it determines that
the application cannot get the process ID for that process from the shell. It is also required to remember only {CHILD_MAX} number
of processes in this way. Since the only way to get the process ID from the shell is by using the <tt>'!'</tt> shell parameter, the
shell is allowed to discard the status of an asynchronous list if <tt>"$!"</tt> was not referenced before another asynchronous list
was started. (This means that the shell only has to keep the status of the last asynchronous list started if the application did
not reference <tt>"$!"</tt> . If the implementation of the shell is smart enough to determine that a reference to <tt>"$!"</tt> was
not saved anywhere that the application can retrieve it later, it can use this information to trim the list of saved information.
Note also that a successful call to <i>wait</i> with no operands discards the exit status of all asynchronous lists.)</p>

<p>If the exit status of <i>wait</i> is greater than 128, there is no way for the application to know if the waited-for process
exited with that value or was killed by a signal. Since most utilities exit with small values, there is seldom any ambiguity. Even
in the ambiguous cases, most applications just need to know that the asynchronous job failed; it does not matter whether it
detected an error and failed or was killed and did not complete its job normally.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_168_17"></a>EXAMPLES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the exact value used when a process is terminated by a signal is unspecified, if it is known that a signal terminated a
process, a script can still reliably determine which signal by using <a href="../utilities/kill.html"><i>kill</i></a> as shown by
the following script:</p>

<pre>
<tt>sleep 1000&amp;
pid=$!
kill -kill $pid
wait $pid
echo $pid was terminated by a SIG$(kill -l $?) signal.
</tt>
</pre>

<p>If the following sequence of commands is run in less than 31 seconds:</p>

<pre>
<tt>sleep 257 | sleep 31 &amp;
jobs -l %%
</tt>
</pre>

<p>either of the following commands returns the exit status of the second <a href="../utilities/sleep.html"><i>sleep</i></a> in the
pipeline:</p>

<pre>
<tt>wait</tt> <i>&lt;pid of sleep 31&gt;</i><tt>wait %%
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_04_168_18"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The description of <i>wait</i> does not refer to the <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> function from the
System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 because that would needlessly overspecify this interface. However, the
wording means that <i>wait</i> is required to wait for an explicit process when it is given an argument so that the status
information of other processes is not consumed. Historical implementations use the <a href=
"../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a> function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 until
<a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a> returns the requested process ID or finds that the requested process does not
exist. Because this means that a shell script could not reliably get the status of all background children if a second background
job was ever started before the first job finished, it is recommended that the <i>wait</i> utility use a method such as the
functionality provided by the <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> function.</p>

<p>The ability to wait for multiple <i>pid</i> operands was adopted from the KornShell.</p>

<p>This new functionality was added because it is needed to determine the exit status of any asynchronous list accurately. The only
compatibility problem that this change creates is for a script like</p>

<pre>
<tt>while sleep 60 do
    job&amp; echo Job started $(date) as $!  done
</tt>
</pre>

<p>which causes the shell to monitor all of the jobs started until the script terminates or runs out of memory. This would not be a
problem if the loop did not reference <tt>"$!"</tt> or if the script would occasionally <i>wait</i> for jobs it started.</p>
