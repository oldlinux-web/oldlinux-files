<blockquote>pthread_cancel - cancel execution of a thread</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_513_02"></a>SYNOPSIS</h4>

<h4><a name="tag_03_513_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall request that <i>thread</i> be canceled. The target thread's cancelability state and
type determines when the cancelation takes effect. When the cancelation is acted on, the cancelation cleanup handlers for
<i>thread</i> shall be called. When the last cancelation cleanup handler returns, the thread-specific data destructor functions
shall be called for <i>thread</i>. When the last destructor function returns, <i>thread</i> shall be terminated.</p>

<p>The cancelation processing in the target thread shall run asynchronously with respect to the calling thread returning from
<i>pthread_cancel</i>().</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_513_04"></a>RETURN VALUE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>If successful, the <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
the error.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_513_05"></a>ERRORS</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function may fail if:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>[ESRCH]</dt>

<dd>No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given thread ID.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <i>pthread_cancel</i>() function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].</p>

<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_513_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Two alternative functions were considered for sending the cancelation notification to a thread. One would be to define a new
SIGCANCEL signal that had the cancelation semantics when delivered; the other was to define the new <i>pthread_cancel</i>()
function, which would trigger the cancelation semantics.</p>

<p>The advantage of a new signal was that so much of the delivery criteria were identical to that used when trying to deliver a
signal that making cancelation notification a signal was seen as consistent. Indeed, many implementations implement cancelation
using a special signal. On the other hand, there would be no signal functions that could be used with this signal except <a href=
"../functions/pthread_kill.html"><i>pthread_kill</i>()</a>, and the behavior of the delivered cancelation signal would be unlike
any previously existing defined signal.</p>

<p>The benefits of a special function include the recognition that this signal would be defined because of the similar delivery
criteria and that this is the only common behavior between a cancelation request and a signal. In addition, the cancelation
delivery mechanism does not have to be implemented as a signal. There are also strong, if not stronger, parallels with language
exception mechanisms than with signals that are potentially obscured if the delivery mechanism is visibly closer to signals.</p>

<p>In the end, it was considered that as there were so many exceptions to the use of the new signal with existing signals functions
it would be misleading. A special function has resolved this problem. This function was carefully defined so that an implementation
wishing to provide the cancelation functions on top of signals could do so. The special function also means that implementations
are not obliged to implement cancelation with signals.</p>
