<h4><a name="tag_03_757_03"></a>DESCRIPTION</h4>

<blockquote>
<div class="box"><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('CX')">CX</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]"
border="0"> The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO&nbsp;C standard is unintentional. This volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO&nbsp;C standard. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></div>

<p>If <i>command</i> is a null pointer, the <i>system</i>() function shall determine whether the host environment has a command
processor. If <i>command</i> is not a null pointer, the <i>system</i>() function shall pass the string pointed to by <i>command</i>
to that command processor to be executed in an implementation-defined manner; this might then cause the program calling
<i>system</i>() to behave in a non-conforming manner or to terminate.</p>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('CX')">CX</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> The
environment of the executed command shall be as if a child process were created using <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>, and the child process invoked the <a href="../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility
using <a href="../functions/execl.html"><i>execl</i>()</a> as follows:</p>

<pre>
<tt>execl(&lt;</tt><i>shell path</i><tt>&gt;, "sh", "-c",</tt> <i>command</i><tt>, (char *)0);
</tt>
</pre>

<p>where &lt;<i>shell path</i>&gt; is an unspecified pathname for the <a href="../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility.</p>

<p>The <i>system</i>() function shall ignore the SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals, and shall block the SIGCHLD signal, while waiting for
the command to terminate. If this might cause the application to miss a signal that would have killed it, then the application
should examine the return value from <i>system</i>() and take whatever action is appropriate to the application if the command
terminated due to receipt of a signal.</p>

<p>The <i>system</i>() function shall not affect the termination status of any child of the calling processes other than the
process or processes it itself creates.</p>

<p>The <i>system</i>() function shall not return until the child process has terminated. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt=

</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_757_04"></a>RETURN VALUE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>If <i>command</i> is a null pointer, <i>system</i>() shall return non-zero to indicate that a command processor is available, or
zero if none is available. <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('CX')">CX</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt=
"[Option Start]" border="0"> The <i>system</i>() function shall always return non-zero when <i>command</i> is NULL. <img src=

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('CX')">CX</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> If
<i>command</i> is not a null pointer, <i>system</i>() shall return the termination status of the command language interpreter in
the format specified by <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>. The termination status shall be as defined for
the <a href="../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility; otherwise, the termination status is unspecified. If some error prevents
the command language interpreter from executing after the child process is created, the return value from <i>system</i>() shall be
as if the command language interpreter had terminated using <i>exit</i>(127) or <i>_exit</i>(127). If a child process cannot be
created, or if the termination status for the command language interpreter cannot be obtained, <i>system</i>() shall return -1 and
set <i>errno</i> to indicate the error. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<h4><a name="tag_03_757_06"></a>EXAMPLES</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>None.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_757_07"></a>APPLICATION USAGE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>If the return value of <i>system</i>() is not -1, its value can be decoded through the use of the macros described in <a href=
"../basedefs/sys/wait.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</i></a>. For convenience, these macros are also provided in <a href=
"../basedefs/stdlib.h.html"><i>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</i></a>.</p>

<p>Note that, while <i>system</i>() must ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT and block SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate, the
handling of signals in the executed command is as specified by <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> and <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>. For example, if SIGINT is being caught or is set to SIG_DFL when <i>system</i>() is called,
then the child is started with SIGINT handling set to SIG_DFL.</p>

<p>Ignoring SIGINT and SIGQUIT in the parent process prevents coordination problems (two processes reading from the same terminal,
for example) when the executed command ignores or catches one of the signals. It is also usually the correct action when the user
has given a command to the application to be executed synchronously (as in the <tt>'!'</tt> command in many interactive
applications). In either case, the signal should be delivered only to the child process, not to the application itself. There is
one situation where ignoring the signals might have less than the desired effect. This is when the application uses <i>system</i>()
to perform some task invisible to the user. If the user typed the interrupt character ( <tt>"^C"</tt> , for example) while
<i>system</i>() is being used in this way, one would expect the application to be killed, but only the executed command is killed.
Applications that use <i>system</i>() in this way should carefully check the return status from <i>system</i>() to see if the
executed command was successful, and should take appropriate action when the command fails.</p>

<p>Blocking SIGCHLD while waiting for the child to terminate prevents the application from catching the signal and obtaining status
from <i>system</i>()'s child process before <i>system</i>() can get the status itself.</p>

<p>The context in which the utility is ultimately executed may differ from that in which <i>system</i>() was called. For example,
file descriptors that have the FD_CLOEXEC flag set are closed, and the process ID and parent process ID are different. Also, if the
executed utility changes its environment variables or its current working directory, that change is not reflected in the caller's
context.</p>

<p>There is no defined way for an application to find the specific path for the shell. However, <a href=
"../functions/confstr.html"><i>confstr</i>()</a> can provide a value for <i>PATH</i> that is guaranteed to find the <a href=
"../utilities/sh.html"><i>sh</i></a> utility.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_757_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The <i>system</i>() function should not be used by programs that have set user (or group) ID privileges. The <a href=
"../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> and <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> family of functions (except <a
href="../functions/execlp.html"><i>execlp</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/execvp.html"><i>execvp</i>()</a>), should be used
instead. This prevents any unforeseen manipulation of the environment of the user that could cause execution of commands not
anticipated by the calling program.</p>

<p>There are three levels of specification for the <i>system</i>() function. The ISO&nbsp;C standard gives the most basic. It
requires that the function exists, and defines a way for an application to query whether a command language interpreter exists. It
says nothing about the command language or the environment in which the command is interpreted.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 places additional restrictions on <i>system</i>(). It requires that if there is a command
language interpreter, the environment must be as specified by <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a> and <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>. This ensures, for example, that close-on- <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>
works, that file locks are not inherited, and that the process ID is different. It also specifies the return value from
<i>system</i>() when the command line can be run, thus giving the application some information about the command's completion
status.</p>

<p>Finally, IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 requires the command to be interpreted as in the shell command language defined in the
Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>Note that, <i>system</i>(NULL) is required to return non-zero, indicating that there is a command language interpreter. At first
glance, this would seem to conflict with the ISO&nbsp;C standard which allows <i>system</i>(NULL) to return zero. There is no
conflict, however. A system must have a command language interpreter, and is non-conforming if none is present. It is therefore
permissible for the <i>system</i>() function on such a system to implement the behavior specified by the ISO&nbsp;C standard as
long as it is understood that the implementation does not conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 if <i>system</i>(NULL) returns
zero.</p>

<p>It was explicitly decided that when <i>command</i> is NULL, <i>system</i>() should not be required to check to make sure that
the command language interpreter actually exists with the correct mode, that there are enough processes to execute it, and so on.
The call <i>system</i>(NULL) could, theoretically, check for such problems as too many existing child processes, and return zero.
However, it would be inappropriate to return zero due to such a (presumably) transient condition. If some condition exists that is
not under the control of this application and that would cause any <i>system</i>() call to fail, that system has been rendered
non-conforming.</p>

<p>Early drafts required, or allowed, <i>system</i>() to return with <i>errno</i> set to [EINTR] if it was interrupted with a
signal. This error return was removed, and a requirement that <i>system</i>() not return until the child has terminated was added.
This means that if a <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a> call in <i>system</i>() exits with <i>errno</i> set
to [EINTR], <i>system</i>() must reissue the <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>. This change was made for two
reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>There is no way for an application to clean up if <i>system</i>() returns [EINTR], short of calling <a href=
"../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, and that could have the undesirable effect of returning the status of children other
than the one started by <i>system</i>().</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>While it might require a change in some historical implementations, those implementations already have to be changed because
they use <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a> instead of <a href=
"../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that if the application is catching SIGCHLD signals, it will receive such a signal before a successful <i>system</i>() call
returns.</p>

<p>To conform to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <i>system</i>() must use <a href="../functions/waitpid.html"><i>waitpid</i>()</a>,
or some similar function, instead of <a href="../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>The following code sample illustrates how <i>system</i>() might be implemented on an implementation conforming to
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<pre>
<tt>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
int system(const char *cmd)
{
    int stat;
    pid_t pid;
    struct sigaction sa, savintr, savequit;
    sigset_t saveblock;
    if (cmd == NULL)
        return(1);
    sa.sa_handler = SIG_IGN;
    sigemptyset(&amp;sa.sa_mask);
    sa.sa_flags = 0;
    sigemptyset(&amp;savintr.sa_mask);
    sigemptyset(&amp;savequit.sa_mask);
    sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;sa, &amp;savintr);
    sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;sa, &amp;savequit);
    sigaddset(&amp;sa.sa_mask, SIGCHLD);
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &amp;sa.sa_mask, &amp;saveblock);
    if ((pid = fork()) == 0) {
        sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;savintr, (struct sigaction *)0);
        sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;savequit, (struct sigaction *)0);
        sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;saveblock, (sigset_t *)0);
        execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", cmd, (char *)0);
        _exit(127);
    }
    if (pid == -1) {
        stat = -1; /* errno comes from fork() */
    } else {
        while (waitpid(pid, &amp;stat, 0) == -1) {
            if (errno != EINTR){
                stat = -1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    sigaction(SIGINT, &amp;savintr, (struct sigaction *)0);
    sigaction(SIGQUIT, &amp;savequit, (struct sigaction *)0);
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;saveblock, (sigset_t *)0);
    return(stat);
}
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Note that, while a particular implementation of <i>system</i>() (such as the one above) can assume a particular path for the
shell, such a path is not necessarily valid on another system. The above example is not portable, and is not intended to be.</p>

<p>One reviewer suggested that an implementation of <i>system</i>() might want to use an environment variable such as <i>SHELL</i>
to determine which command interpreter to use. The supposed implementation would use the default command interpreter if the one
specified by the environment variable was not available. This would allow a user, when using an application that prompts for
command lines to be processed using <i>system</i>(), to specify a different command interpreter. Such an implementation is
discouraged. If the alternate command interpreter did not follow the command line syntax specified in the Shell and Utilities
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, then changing <i>SHELL</i> would render <i>system</i>() non-conforming. This would affect
applications that expected the specified behavior from <i>system</i>(), and since the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not mention that <i>SHELL</i> affects <i>system</i>(), the application would not know that it
needed to unset <i>SHELL .</i></p>
