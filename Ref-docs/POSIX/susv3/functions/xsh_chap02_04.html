<h3><a name="tag_02_04"></a>Signal Concepts</h3>

<h4><a name="tag_02_04_01"></a>Signal Generation and Delivery</h4>

<p>A signal is said to be ``generated'' for (or sent to) a process or thread when the event that causes the signal first occurs.
Examples of such events include detection of hardware faults, timer expiration, <sup>[<a href=
"javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;signals
generated via the <b>sigevent</b> structure <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"> and terminal activity,
as well as invocations of the <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> <sup>[<a href=
"javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;and <a href=
"../functions/sigqueue.html"><i>sigqueue</i>()</a> functions. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"> In
some circumstances, the same event generates signals for multiple processes.</p>

<p>At the time of generation, a determination shall be made whether the signal has been generated for the process or for a specific
thread within the process. Signals which are generated by some action attributable to a particular thread, such as a hardware
fault, shall be generated for the thread that caused the signal to be generated. Signals that are generated in association with a
process ID or process group ID or an asynchronous event, such as terminal activity, shall be generated for the process.</p>

<p>Each process has an action to be taken in response to each signal defined by the system (see <a href="#tag_02_04_03">Signal
Actions</a> ). A signal is said to be ``delivered'' to a process when the appropriate action for the process and signal is taken. A
signal is said to be ``accepted'' by a process when the signal is selected and returned by one of the <a href=
"../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> functions.</p>

<p>During the time between the generation of a signal and its delivery or acceptance, the signal is said to be ``pending''.
Ordinarily, this interval cannot be detected by an application. However, a signal can be ``blocked'' from delivery to a thread. If
the action associated with a blocked signal is anything other than to ignore the signal, and if that signal is generated for the
thread, the signal shall remain pending until it is unblocked, it is accepted when it is selected and returned by a call to the <a
href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function, or the action associated with it is set to ignore the signal.
Signals generated for the process shall be delivered to exactly one of those threads within the process which is in a call to a <a
href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function selecting that signal or has not blocked delivery of the signal. If
there are no threads in a call to a <a href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function selecting that signal, and if
all threads within the process block delivery of the signal, the signal shall remain pending on the process until a thread calls a
<a href="../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> function selecting that signal, a thread unblocks delivery of the signal,
or the action associated with the signal is set to ignore the signal. If the action associated with a blocked signal is to ignore
the signal and if that signal is generated for the process, it is unspecified whether the signal is discarded immediately upon
generation or remains pending.</p>

<p>Each thread has a ``signal mask'' that defines the set of signals currently blocked from delivery to it. The signal mask for a
thread shall be initialized from that of its parent or creating thread, or from the corresponding thread in the parent process if
the thread was created as the result of a call to <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>. The <a href=
"../functions/pthread_sigmask.html"><i>pthread_sigmask</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/sigaction.html"><i>sigaction</i>()</a>, <a
href="../functions/sigprocmask.html"><i>sigprocmask</i>()</a>, and <a href="../functions/sigsuspend.html"><i>sigsuspend</i>()</a>
functions control the manipulation of the signal mask.</p>

<p>The determination of which action is taken in response to a signal is made at the time the signal is delivered, allowing for any
changes since the time of generation. This determination is independent of the means by which the signal was originally generated.
If a subsequent occurrence of a pending signal is generated, it is implementation-defined as to whether the signal is delivered or
accepted more than once <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt=
"[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;in circumstances other than those in which queuing is required under the Realtime Signals
Extension option. The order in which multiple, simultaneously pending signals outside the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX are delivered
to or accepted by a process is unspecified. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>When any stop signal (SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU) is generated for a process, any pending SIGCONT signals for that
process shall be discarded. Conversely, when SIGCONT is generated for a process, all pending stop signals for that process shall be
discarded. When SIGCONT is generated for a process that is stopped, the process shall be continued, even if the SIGCONT signal is
blocked or ignored. If SIGCONT is blocked and not ignored, it shall remain pending until it is either unblocked or a stop signal is
generated for the process.</p>

<p>An implementation shall document any condition not specified by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 under which the
implementation generates signals.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_02_04_02"></a>Realtime Signal Generation and Delivery</h4>

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
This section describes extensions to support realtime signal generation and delivery. This functionality is dependent on support of
the Realtime Signals Extension option (and the rest of this section is not further marked for this option). <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>Some signal-generating functions, such as high-resolution timer expiration, asynchronous I/O completion, interprocess message
arrival, and the <a href="../functions/sigqueue.html"><i>sigqueue</i>()</a> function, support the specification of an
application-defined value, either explicitly as a parameter to the function or in a <b>sigevent</b> structure parameter. The
<b>sigevent</b> structure is defined in <a href="../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a> and contains at least the
following members:</p>

<p>The <i>sigev_notify</i> member specifies the notification mechanism to use when an asynchronous event occurs. This volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 defines the following values for the <i>sigev_notify</i> member:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>SIGEV_NONE</dt>

<dd>No asynchronous notification shall be delivered when the event of interest occurs.</dd>

<dt>SIGEV_SIGNAL</dt>

<dd>The signal specified in <i>sigev_signo</i> shall be generated for the process when the event of interest occurs. If the
implementation supports the Realtime Signals Extension option and if the SA_SIGINFO flag is set for that signal number, then the
signal shall be queued to the process and the value specified in <i>sigev_value</i> shall be the <i>si_value</i> component of the
generated signal. If SA_SIGINFO is not set for that signal number, it is unspecified whether the signal is queued and what value,
if any, is sent.</dd>

<dt>SIGEV_THREAD</dt>

<dd>A notification function shall be called to perform notification.</dd>
</dl>

<p>An implementation may define additional notification mechanisms.</p>

<p>The <i>sigev_signo</i> member specifies the signal to be generated. The <i>sigev_value</i> member is the application-defined
value to be passed to the signal-catching function at the time of the signal delivery or to be returned at signal acceptance as the
<i>si_value</i> member of the <b>siginfo_t</b> structure.</p>

<p>The <b>sigval</b> union is defined in <a href="../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a> and contains at least the
following members:</p>

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" align="center">
<tr valign="top">
<th align="center">
<p class="tent"><b>Member Type</b></p>
</th>
<th align="center">

<td align="left">
<p class="tent"><i>sival_ptr</i></p>
</td>
<td align="left">
<p class="tent">Pointer signal value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>The <i>sival_int</i> member shall be used when the application-defined value is of type <b>int</b>; the <i>sival_ptr</i> member
shall be used when the application-defined value is a pointer.</p>

<p>When a signal is generated by the <a href="../functions/sigqueue.html"><i>sigqueue</i>()</a> function or any signal-generating
function that supports the specification of an application-defined value, the signal shall be marked pending and, if the SA_SIGINFO
flag is set for that signal, the signal shall be queued to the process along with the application-specified signal value. Multiple
occurrences of signals so generated are queued in FIFO order. It is unspecified whether signals so generated are queued when the
SA_SIGINFO flag is not set for that signal.</p>

<p>Signals generated by the <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> function or other events that cause signals to
occur, such as detection of hardware faults, <a href="../functions/alarm.html"><i>alarm</i>()</a> timer expiration, or terminal
activity, and for which the implementation does not support queuing, shall have no effect on signals already queued for the same
signal number.</p>

<p>When multiple unblocked signals, all in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX, are pending, the behavior shall be as if the
implementation delivers the pending unblocked signal with the lowest signal number within that range. No other ordering of signal
delivery is specified.</p>

<p>If, when a pending signal is delivered, there are additional signals queued to that signal number, the signal shall remain
pending. Otherwise, the pending indication shall be reset.</p>

<p>Multi-threaded programs can use an alternate event notification mechanism. When a notification is processed, and the
<i>sigev_notify</i> member of the <b>sigevent</b> structure has the value SIGEV_THREAD, the function <i>sigev_notify_function</i>
is called with parameter <i>sigev_value</i>.</p>

<p>The function shall be executed in an environment as if it were the <i>start_routine</i> for a newly created thread with thread
attributes specified by <i>sigev_notify_attributes</i>. If <i>sigev_notify_attributes</i> is NULL, the behavior shall be as if the
thread were created with the <i>detachstate</i> attribute set to PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED. Supplying an attributes structure with a
<i>detachstate</i> attribute of PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE results in undefined behavior. The signal mask of this thread is
implementation-defined.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_02_04_03"></a>Signal Actions</h4>

<p>There are three types of action that can be associated with a signal: SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN, or a pointer to a function. Initially,
all signals shall be set to SIG_DFL or SIG_IGN prior to entry of the <i>main</i>() routine (see the <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> functions). The actions prescribed by these values are as follows:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt>SIG_DFL</dt>

<dd>Signal-specific default action. 

<p>The default actions for the signals defined in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 are specified under <a href=
"../basedefs/signal.h.html"><i>&lt;signal.h&gt;</i></a>. <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;If the Realtime Signals Extension option is supported, the default
actions for the realtime signals in the range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX shall be to terminate the process abnormally. <img src=
"../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>

<p>If the default action is to stop the process, the execution of that process is temporarily suspended. When a process stops, a
SIGCHLD signal shall be generated for its parent process, unless the parent process has set the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag. While a process
is stopped, any additional signals that are sent to the process shall not be delivered until the process is continued, except
SIGKILL which always terminates the receiving process. A process that is a member of an orphaned process group shall not be allowed
to stop in response to the SIGTSTP, SIGTTIN, or SIGTTOU signals. In cases where delivery of one of these signals would stop such a
process, the signal shall be discarded.</p>

<p>Setting a signal action to SIG_DFL for a signal that is pending, and whose default action is to ignore the signal (for example,
SIGCHLD), shall cause the pending signal to be discarded, whether or not it is blocked.</p>

<p>The default action for SIGCONT is to resume execution at the point where the process was stopped, after first handling any
pending unblocked signals. <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt=
"[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;If the Realtime Signals Extension option is supported, any queued values pending shall be
discarded and the resources used to queue them shall be released and returned to the system for other use. <img src=

<p><sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0">
When a stopped process is continued, a SIGCHLD signal may be generated for its parent process, unless the parent process has set
the SA_NOCLDSTOP flag. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></p>
</dd>

<dt>SIG_IGN</dt>

<dd>Ignore signal. 

<p>Delivery of the signal shall have no effect on the process. The behavior of a process is undefined after it ignores a SIGFPE,
SIGILL, SIGSEGV, <sup>[<a href="javascript:open_code('RTS')">RTS</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]"

<p>The system shall not allow the action for the signals SIGKILL or SIGSTOP to be set to SIG_IGN.</p>

<p>Setting a signal action to SIG_IGN for a signal that is pending shall cause the pending signal to be discarded, whether or not
it is blocked.</p>

<p>If a process sets the action for the SIGCHLD signal to SIG_IGN, the behavior is unspecified, <sup>[<a href=
"javascript:open_code('XSI')">XSI</a>]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> &nbsp;except as
specified below.</p>

<p>If the action for the SIGCHLD signal is set to SIG_IGN, child processes of the calling processes shall not be transformed into
zombie processes when they terminate. If the calling process subsequently waits for its children, and the process has no
unwaited-for children that were transformed into zombie processes, it shall block until all of its children terminate, and <a href=
"../functions/wait.html"><i>wait</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/waitid.html"><i>waitid</i>()</a>, and <a href=

</dd>

Catch signal. 

<p>On delivery of the signal, the receiving process is to execute the signal-catching function at the specified address. After
returning from the signal-catching function, the receiving process shall resume execution at the point at which it was
interrupted.</p>

<p>If the SA_SIGINFO flag for the signal is cleared, the signal-catching function shall be entered as a C-language function call as

<p>All functions not in the above table are considered to be unsafe with respect to signals. In the presence of signals, all
functions defined by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 shall behave as defined when called from or interrupted by a
signal-catching function, with a single exception: when a signal interrupts an unsafe function and the signal-catching function
calls an unsafe function, the behavior is undefined.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>When a signal is delivered to a thread, if the action of that signal specifies termination, stop, or continue, the entire
process shall be terminated, stopped, or continued, respectively.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_02_04_04"></a>Signal Effects on Other Functions</h4>

<p>Signals affect the behavior of certain functions defined by this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 if delivered to a
process while it is executing such a function. If the action of the signal is to terminate the process, the process shall be
terminated and the function shall not return. If the action of the signal is to stop the process, the process shall stop until
continued or terminated. Generation of a SIGCONT signal for the process shall cause the process to be continued, and the original
function shall continue at the point the process was stopped. If the action of the signal is to invoke a signal-catching function,
the signal-catching function shall be invoked; in this case the original function is said to be ``interrupted'' by the signal. If
the signal-catching function executes a <b>return</b> statement, the behavior of the interrupted function shall be as described
individually for that function, except as noted for unsafe functions. Signals that are ignored shall not affect the behavior of any
function; signals that are blocked shall not affect the behavior of any function until they are unblocked and then delivered,
except as specified for the <a href="../functions/sigpending.html"><i>sigpending</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/sigwait.html"><i>sigwait</i>()</a> functions.</p>
