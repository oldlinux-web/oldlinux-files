<h4><a name="tag_03_670_08"></a>RATIONALE</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The various behaviors of the <i>setuid</i>() and <a href="../functions/setgid.html"><i>setgid</i>()</a> functions when called by
non-privileged processes reflect the behavior of different historical implementations. For portability, it is recommended that new
non-privileged applications use the <a href="../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/setegid.html"><i>setegid</i>()</a> functions instead.</p>

<p>The saved set-user-ID capability allows a program to regain the effective user ID established at the last <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> call. Similarly, the saved set-group-ID capability allows a program to regain the effective
group ID established at the last <i><a href="../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> call. These capabilities are derived from System
V. Without them, a program might have to run as superuser in order to perform the same functions, because superuser can write on
the user's files. This is a problem because such a program can write on any user's files, and so must be carefully written to
emulate the permissions of the calling process properly. In System V, these capabilities have traditionally been implemented only
via the <i>setuid</i>() and <a href="../functions/setgid.html"><i>setgid</i>()</a> functions for non-privileged processes. The fact
that the behavior of those functions was different for privileged processes made them difficult to use. The POSIX.1-1990 standard
defined the <i>setuid</i>() function to behave differently for privileged and unprivileged users. When the caller had the
appropriate privilege, the function set the calling process' real user ID, effective user ID, and saved set-user ID on
implementations that supported it. When the caller did not have the appropriate privilege, the function set only the effective user
ID, subject to permission checks. The former use is generally needed for utilities like <i>login</i> and <i>su</i>, which are not
conforming applications and thus outside the scope of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. These utilities wish to change the user ID
irrevocably to a new value, generally that of an unprivileged user. The latter use is needed for conforming applications that are
installed with the set-user-ID bit and need to perform operations using the real user ID.</p>

<p>IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 augments the latter functionality with a mandatory feature named _POSIX_SAVED_IDS. This feature
permits a set-user-ID application to switch its effective user ID back and forth between the values of its <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i>-time real user ID and effective user ID. Unfortunately, the POSIX.1-1990 standard did not
permit a conforming application using this feature to work properly when it happened to be executed with the
(implementation-defined) appropriate privilege. Furthermore, the application did not even have a means to tell whether it had this
privilege. Since the saved set-user-ID feature is quite desirable for applications, as evidenced by the fact that NIST required it
in FIPS 151-2, it has been mandated by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. However, there are implementors who have been reluctant to
support it given the limitation described above.</p>

<p>The 4.3BSD system handles the problem by supporting separate functions: <i>setuid</i>() (which always sets both the real and
effective user IDs, like <i>setuid</i>() in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 for privileged users), and <a href=
"../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> (which always sets just the effective user ID, like <i>setuid</i>() in
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 for non-privileged users). This separation of functionality into distinct functions seems desirable.
4.3BSD does not support the saved set-user-ID feature. It supports similar functionality of switching the effective user ID back
and forth via <a href="../functions/setreuid.html"><i>setreuid</i>()</a>, which permits reversing the real and effective user IDs.
This model seems less desirable than the saved set-user-ID because the real user ID changes as a side effect. The current 4.4BSD
includes saved effective IDs and uses them for <a href="../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> and <a href=
"../functions/setegid.html"><i>setegid</i>()</a> as described above. The <a href="../functions/setreuid.html"><i>setreuid</i>()</a>
and <a href="../functions/setregid.html"><i>setregid</i>()</a> functions will be deprecated or removed.</p>

<p>The solution here is:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Require that all implementations support the functionality of the saved set-user-ID, which is set by the <i><a href=
"../functions/exec.html">exec</a></i> functions and by privileged calls to <i>setuid</i>().</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Add the <a href="../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> and <a href="../functions/setegid.html"><i>setegid</i>()</a>
functions as portable alternatives to <i>setuid</i>() and <a href="../functions/setgid.html"><i>setgid</i>()</a> for non-privileged
and privileged processes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Historical systems have provided two mechanisms for a set-user-ID process to change its effective user ID to be the same as its
real user ID in such a way that it could return to the original effective user ID: the use of the <i>setuid</i>() function in the
presence of a saved set-user-ID, or the use of the BSD <a href="../functions/setreuid.html"><i>setreuid</i>()</a> function, which
was able to swap the real and effective user IDs. The changes included in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 provide a new mechanism
using <a href="../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> in conjunction with a saved set-user-ID. Thus, all implementations
with the new <a href="../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> mechanism will have a saved set-user-ID for each process, and
most of the behavior controlled by _POSIX_SAVED_IDS has been changed to agree with the case where the option was defined. The <a
href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> function is an exception. Implementors of the new <a href=
"../functions/seteuid.html"><i>seteuid</i>()</a> mechanism will generally be required to maintain compatibility with the older
mechanisms previously supported by their systems. However, compatibility with this use of <a href=
"../functions/setreuid.html"><i>setreuid</i>()</a> and with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS behavior of <a href=
"../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> is unfortunately complicated. If an implementation with a saved set-user-ID allows a
process to use <a href="../functions/setreuid.html"><i>setreuid</i>()</a> to swap its real and effective user IDs, but were to
leave the saved set-user-ID unmodified, the process would then have an effective user ID equal to the original real user ID, and
both real and saved set-user-ID would be equal to the original effective user ID. In that state, the real user would be unable to
kill the process, even though the effective user ID of the process matches that of the real user, if the <a href=
"../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> behavior of _POSIX_SAVED_IDS was used. This is obviously not acceptable. The alternative
choice, which is used in at least one implementation, is to change the saved set-user-ID to the effective user ID during most calls
to <a href="../functions/setreuid.html"><i>setreuid</i>()</a>. The standard developers considered that alternative to be less
correct than the retention of the old behavior of <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> in such systems. Current
conforming applications shall accommodate either behavior from <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a>, and there
appears to be no strong reason for <a href="../functions/kill.html"><i>kill</i>()</a> to check the saved set-user-ID rather than
the effective user ID.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_03_670_11"></a>CHANGE HISTORY</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><a name="tag_03_670_12"></a>Issue 6</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>In the SYNOPSIS, the optional include of the <a href="../basedefs/sys/types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> header is
removed.</p>

<p>The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The requirement to include <a href="../basedefs/sys/types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> has been removed. Although <a
href="../basedefs/sys/types.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i></a> was required for conforming implementations of previous POSIX
specifications, it was not required for UNIX applications.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The functionality associated with _POSIX_SAVED_IDS is now mandatory. This is a FIPS requirement.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The following changes were made to align with the IEEE&nbsp;P1003.1a draft standard:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The effects of <i>setuid</i>() in processes without appropriate privileges are changed.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A requirement that the supplementary group list is not affected is added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
