<h2><a name="tag_07"></a>Locale</h2>

<h3><a name="tag_07_01"></a>General</h3>

<p>A locale is the definition of the subset of a user's environment that depends on language and cultural conventions. It is made
up from one or more categories. Each category is identified by its name and controls specific aspects of the behavior of components
of the system. Category names correspond to the following environment variable names:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><i>LC_CTYPE</i></dt>

<dd>Character classification and case conversion.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_COLLATE</i></dt>

<dd>Collation order.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_MONETARY</i></dt>

<dd>Monetary formatting.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_NUMERIC</i></dt>

<dd>Numeric, non-monetary formatting.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_TIME</i></dt>

<dd>Date and time formats.</dd>

<dt><i>LC_MESSAGES</i></dt>

<dd>Formats of informative and diagnostic messages and interactive responses.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The standard utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 shall base their behavior on the
current locale, as defined in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES section for each utility. The behavior of some of the C-language functions
defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 shall also be modified based on the current locale, as
defined by the last call to <a href="../functions/setlocale.html"><i>setlocale</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>Locales other than those supplied by the implementation can be created via the <a href=
"../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> utility, provided that the _POSIX2_LOCALEDEF symbol is defined on the system.
Even if <a href="../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> is not provided, all implementations conforming to the System
Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 shall provide one or more locales that behave as described in this chapter. The
input to the utility is described in <a href="#tag_07_03">Locale Definition</a> . The value that is used to specify a locale when
using environment variables shall be the string specified as the <i>name</i> operand to the <a href=
"../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> utility when the locale was created. The strings <tt>"C"</tt> and
<tt>"POSIX"</tt> are reserved as identifiers for the POSIX locale (see <a href="#tag_07_02">POSIX Locale</a> ). When the value of a
locale environment variable begins with a slash ( <tt>'/'</tt> ), it shall be interpreted as the pathname of the locale definition;
the type of file (regular, directory, and so on) used to store the locale definition is implementation-defined. If the value does
not begin with a slash, the mechanism used to locate the locale is implementation-defined.</p>

<p>If different character sets are used by the locale categories, the results achieved by an application utilizing these categories
are undefined. Likewise, if different codesets are used for the data being processed by interfaces whose behavior is dependent on
the current locale, or the codeset is different from the codeset assumed when the locale was created, the result is also
undefined.</p>

<p>Applications can select the desired locale by invoking the <a href="../functions/setlocale.html"><i>setlocale</i>()</a> function
(or equivalent) with the appropriate value. If the function is invoked with an empty string, such as:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>the value of the corresponding environment variable is used. If the environment variable is unset or is set to the empty string,
the implementation shall set the appropriate environment as defined in <a href="xbd_chap08.html#tag_08"><i>Environment
Variables</i></a> .</p>

<h3><a name="tag_07_02"></a>POSIX Locale</h3>

<p>Conforming systems shall provide a POSIX locale, also known as the C locale. The behavior of standard utilities and functions in
the POSIX locale shall be as if the locale was defined via the <a href="../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> utility
with input data from the POSIX locale tables in <a href="#tag_07_03">Locale Definition</a> .</p>

<p>The tables in <a href="#tag_07_03">Locale Definition</a> describe the characteristics and behavior of the POSIX locale for data
consisting entirely of characters from the portable character set and the control character set. For other characters, the behavior
is unspecified. For C-language programs, the POSIX locale shall be the default locale when the <a href=
"../functions/setlocale.html"><i>setlocale</i>()</a> function is not called.</p>

<p>The POSIX locale can be specified by assigning to the appropriate environment variables the values <tt>"C"</tt> or
<tt>"POSIX"</tt> .</p>

<p>All implementations shall define a locale as the default locale, to be invoked when no environment variables are set, or set to
the empty string. This default locale can be the POSIX locale or any other implementation-defined locale. Some implementations may
provide facilities for local installation administrators to set the default locale, customizing it for each location.
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 does not require such a facility.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_07_03"></a>Locale Definition</h3>

<p>The capability to specify additional locales to those provided by an implementation is optional, denoted by the
_POSIX2_LOCALEDEF symbol. If the option is not supported, only implementation-supplied locales are available. Such locales shall be
documented using the format specified in this section.</p>

<p>Locales can be described with the file format presented in this section. The file format is that accepted by the <a href=
"../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> utility. For the purposes of this section, the file is referred to as the
&quot;locale definition file&quot;, but no locales shall be affected by this file unless it is processed by <a href=
"../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> or some similar mechanism. Any requirements in this section imposed upon the
utility shall apply to <a href="../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> or to any other similar utility used to install
locale information using the locale definition file format described here.</p>

<p>The locale definition file shall contain one or more locale category source definitions, and shall not contain more than one
definition for the same locale category. If the file contains source definitions for more than one category, implementation-defined
categories, if present, shall appear after the categories defined by <a href="#tag_07_01">General</a> . A category source
definition contains either the definition of a category or a <b>copy</b> directive. For a description of the <b>copy</b> directive,
see <a href="../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a>. In the event that some of the information for a locale category, as
specified in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, is missing from the locale source definition, the behavior of that
category, if it is referenced, is unspecified.</p>

<p>A category source definition shall consist of a category header, a category body, and a category trailer. A category header
shall consist of the character string naming of the category, beginning with the characters <i>LC_ .</i> The category trailer shall
consist of the string <tt>"END"</tt> , followed by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s and the string used in the corresponding category
header.</p>

<p>The category body shall consist of one or more lines of text. Each line shall contain an identifier, optionally followed by one
or more operands. Identifiers shall be either keywords, identifying a particular locale element, or collating elements. In addition
to the keywords defined in this volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the source can contain implementation-defined keywords.
Each keyword within a locale shall have a unique name (that is, two categories cannot have a commonly-named keyword); no keyword
shall start with the characters <i>LC_ .</i> Identifiers shall be separated from the operands by one or more &lt;blank&gt;s.</p>

<p>Operands shall be characters, collating elements, or strings of characters. Strings shall be enclosed in double-quotes. Literal
double-quotes within strings shall be preceded by the &lt;<i>escape character</i>&gt;, described below. When a keyword is followed
by more than one operand, the operands shall be separated by semicolons; &lt;blank&gt;s shall be allowed both before and after a
semicolon.</p>

<p>The first category header in the file can be preceded by a line modifying the comment character. It shall have the following
format, starting in column 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>"comment_char %c\n", &lt;</tt><i>comment character</i><tt>&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The comment character shall default to the number sign ( <tt>'#'</tt> ). Blank lines and lines containing the &lt;<i>comment
character</i>&gt; in the first position shall be ignored.</p>

<p>The first category header in the file can be preceded by a line modifying the escape character to be used in the file. It shall
have the following format, starting in column 1:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>"escape_char %c\n", &lt;</tt><i>escape character</i><tt>&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The escape character shall default to backslash, which is the character used in all examples shown in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>A line can be continued by placing an escape character as the last character on the line; this continuation character shall be
discarded from the input. Although the implementation need not accept any one portion of a continued line with a length exceeding
{LINE_MAX} bytes, it shall place no limits on the accumulated length of the continued line. Comment lines shall not be continued on
a subsequent line using an escaped &lt;newline&gt;.</p>

<p>Individual characters, characters in strings, and collating elements shall be represented using symbolic names, as defined
below. In addition, characters can be represented using the characters themselves or as octal, hexadecimal, or decimal constants.
When non-symbolic notation is used, the resultant locale definitions are in many cases not portable between systems. The left angle
bracket ( <tt>'&lt;'</tt> ) is a reserved symbol, denoting the start of a symbolic name; when used to represent itself it shall be
preceded by the escape character. The following rules apply to character representation:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>A character can be represented via a symbolic name, enclosed within angle brackets <tt>'&lt;'</tt> and <tt>'&gt;'</tt> . The
symbolic name, including the angle brackets, shall exactly match a symbolic name defined in the charmap file specified via the <a
href="../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> <b>-f</b> option, and it shall be replaced by a character value determined
from the value associated with the symbolic name in the charmap file. The use of a symbolic name not found in the charmap file
shall constitute an error, unless the category is <i>LC_CTYPE</i> or <i>LC_COLLATE ,</i> in which case it shall constitute a
warning condition (see <a href="../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> for a description of actions resulting from
errors and warnings). The specification of a symbolic name in a <b>collating-element</b> or <b>collating-symbol</b> section that
duplicates a symbolic name in the charmap file (if present) shall be an error. Use of the escape character or a right angle bracket
within a symbolic name is invalid unless the character is preceded by the escape character.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;c&gt;;&lt;c-cedilla&gt;  "&lt;M&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;y&gt;"
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>A character in the portable character set can be represented by the character itself, in which case the value of the character
is implementation-defined. (Implementations may allow other characters to be represented as themselves, but such locale definitions
are not portable.) Within a string, the double-quote character, the escape character, and the right angle bracket character shall
be escaped (preceded by the escape character) to be interpreted as the character itself. Outside strings, the characters:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>,    ;    &lt;    &gt;   </tt> <i>escape_char</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>shall be escaped to be interpreted as the character itself.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>c    "May"
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>A character can be represented as an octal constant. An octal constant shall be specified as the escape character followed by
two or three octal digits. Each constant shall represent a byte value. Multi-byte values can be represented by concatenated
constants specified in byte order with the last constant specifying the least significant byte of the character.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>\143;\347;\143\150   "\115\141\171"
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>A character can be represented as a hexadecimal constant. A hexadecimal constant shall be specified as the escape character
followed by an <tt>'x'</tt> followed by two hexadecimal digits. Each constant shall represent a byte value. Multi-byte values can
be represented by concatenated constants specified in byte order with the last constant specifying the least significant byte of
the character.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>\x63;\xe7;\x63\x68   "\x4d\x61\x79"
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li>
<p>A character can be represented as a decimal constant. A decimal constant shall be specified as the escape character followed by
a <tt>'d'</tt> followed by two or three decimal digits. Each constant represents a byte value. Multi-byte values can be represented
by concatenated constants specified in byte order with the last constant specifying the least significant byte of the
character.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>\d99;\d231;\d99\d104  "\d77\d97\d121"
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Implementations may accept single-digit octal, decimal, or hexadecimal constants following the escape character. Only characters
existing in the character set for which the locale definition is created shall be specified, whether using symbolic names, the
characters themselves, or octal, decimal, or hexadecimal constants. If a charmap file is present, only characters defined in the
charmap can be specified using octal, decimal, or hexadecimal constants. Symbolic names not present in the charmap file can be
specified and shall be ignored, as specified under item 1 above.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_07_03_01"></a>LC_CTYPE</h4>

<p>The <i>LC_CTYPE</i> category shall define character classification, case conversion, and other character attributes. In
addition, a series of characters can be represented by three adjacent periods representing an ellipsis symbol ( <tt>"..."</tt> ).
The ellipsis specification shall be interpreted as meaning that all values between the values preceding and following it represent
valid characters. The ellipsis specification shall be valid only within a single encoded character set; that is, within a group of
characters of the same size. An ellipsis shall be interpreted as including in the list all characters with an encoded value higher
than the encoded value of the character preceding the ellipsis and lower than the encoded value of the character following the
ellipsis.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>\x30;...;\x39;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>includes in the character class all characters with encoded values between the endpoints.</p>

<p>The following keywords shall be recognized. In the descriptions, the term &quot;automatically included&quot; means that it shall not be
an error either to include or omit any of the referenced characters; the implementation provides them if missing (even if the
entire keyword is missing) and accepts them silently if present. When the implementation automatically includes a missing
character, it shall have an encoded value dependent on the charmap file in effect (see the description of the <a href=
"../utilities/localedef.html"><i>localedef</i></a> <b>-f</b> option); otherwise, it shall have a value derived from an
implementation-defined character mapping.</p>

<p>The character classes <b>digit</b>, <b>xdigit</b>, <b>lower</b>, <b>upper</b>, and <b>space</b> have a set of automatically
included characters. These only need to be specified if the character values (that is, encoding) differ from the implementation
default values. It is not possible to define a locale without these automatically included characters unless some implementation
extension is used to prevent their inclusion. Such a definition would not be a proper superset of the C or POSIX locale and, thus,
it might not be possible for conforming applications to work properly.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>copy</b></dt>

<dd>Specify the name of an existing locale which shall be used as the definition of this category. If this keyword is specified, no
other keyword shall be specified.</dd>

</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In a locale definition file, no character specified for the keywords <b>cntrl</b>, <b>digit</b>, <b>punct</b>, or <b>space</b>
shall be specified. The uppercase letters &lt;A&gt; to &lt;Z&gt;, as defined in <a href="xbd_chap06.html#tag_06_04"><i>Character

</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In a locale definition file, no character specified for the keywords <b>cntrl</b>, <b>digit</b>, <b>punct</b>, or <b>space</b>

</dd>

<dt><b>alnum</b></dt>

<dd>Define characters to be classified as letters and numeric digits. Only the characters specified for the <b>alpha</b> and

be specified.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>print</b></dt>

<dd>Define characters to be classified as printable characters, including the &lt;space&gt;. 

<p>In the POSIX locale, all characters in class <b>graph</b> shall be included; no characters in class <b>cntrl</b> shall be
included.</p>

<p>In a locale definition file, characters specified for the keywords <b>upper</b>, <b>lower</b>, <b>alpha</b>, <b>digit</b>,

for the keyword <b>cntrl</b> shall be specified.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>xdigit</b></dt>

<dd>Define the characters to be classified as hexadecimal digits. 

<p>In the POSIX locale, only:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>shall be included.</p>

<p>In a locale definition file, only the characters defined for the class <b>digit</b> shall be specified, in contiguous ascending
sequence by numerical value, followed by one or more sets of six characters representing the hexadecimal digits 10 to 15 inclusive,
with each set in ascending order (for example, &lt;A&gt;, &lt;B&gt;, &lt;C&gt;, &lt;D&gt;, &lt;E&gt;, &lt;F&gt;, &lt;a&gt;,
&lt;b&gt;, &lt;c&gt;, &lt;d&gt;, &lt;e&gt;, &lt;f&gt;). The digits &lt;zero&gt; to &lt;nine&gt;, the uppercase letters &lt;A&gt; to

<p>In the POSIX locale, only the &lt;space&gt; and &lt;tab&gt; shall be included.</p>

<p>In a locale definition file, the &lt;space&gt; and &lt;tab&gt; are automatically included in this class.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>charclass</b></dt>

<dd>Define one or more locale-specific character class names as strings separated by semicolons. Each named character class can
then be defined subsequently in the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> definition. A character class name shall consist of at least one and at most
{CHARCLASS_NAME_MAX} bytes of alphanumeric characters from the portable filename character set. The first character of a character
class name shall not be a digit. The name shall not match any of the <i>LC_CTYPE</i> keywords defined in this volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. Future revisions of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 will not specify any <i>LC_CTYPE</i> keywords
containing uppercase letters.</dd>

<dt><i>charclass-name</i></dt>

<dd>Define characters to be classified as belonging to the named locale-specific character class. In the POSIX locale,
locale-specific named character classes need not exist. 

<p>If a class name is defined by a <b>charclass</b> keyword, but no characters are subsequently assigned to it, this is not an
error; it represents a class without any characters belonging to it.</p>

<p>The <i>charclass-name</i> can be used as the <i>property</i> argument to the <a href=
"../functions/wctype.html"><i>wctype</i>()</a> function, in regular expression and shell pattern-matching bracket expressions, and
by the <a href="../utilities/tr.html"><i>tr</i></a> command.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>toupper</b></dt>

<dd>Define the mapping of lowercase letters to uppercase letters. 

<p>In the POSIX locale, at a minimum, the 26 lowercase characters:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>shall be mapped to the corresponding 26 uppercase characters:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In a locale definition file, the operand shall consist of character pairs, separated by semicolons. The characters in each
character pair shall be separated by a comma and the pair enclosed by parentheses. The first character in each pair is the
lowercase letter, the second the corresponding uppercase letter. Only characters specified for the keywords <b>lower</b> and
<b>upper</b> shall be specified. The lowercase letters &lt;a&gt; to &lt;z&gt;, and their corresponding uppercase letters &lt;A&gt;
to &lt;Z&gt;, of the portable character set are automatically included in this mapping, but only when the <b>toupper</b> keyword is
omitted from the locale definition.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>tolower</b></dt>

<dd>Define the mapping of uppercase letters to lowercase letters. 

<p>In the POSIX locale, at a minimum, the 26 uppercase characters:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>shall be mapped to the corresponding 26 lowercase characters:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In a locale definition file, the operand shall consist of character pairs, separated by semicolons. The characters in each
character pair shall be separated by a comma and the pair enclosed by parentheses. The first character in each pair is the
uppercase letter, the second the corresponding lowercase letter. Only characters specified for the keywords <b>lower</b> and
<b>upper</b> shall be specified. If the <b>tolower</b> keyword is omitted from the locale definition, the mapping is the reverse
mapping of the one specified for <b>toupper</b>.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_07_03_02"></a>LC_COLLATE</h4>

<p>The <i>LC_COLLATE</i> category provides a collation sequence definition for numerous utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume
of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 ( <a href="../utilities/sort.html"><i>sort</i></a>, <a href=
"../utilities/uniq.html"><i>uniq</i></a>, and so on), regular expression matching (see <a href="xbd_chap09.html#tag_09"><i>Regular
Expressions</i></a> ), and the <a href="../functions/strcoll.html"><i>strcoll</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/strxfrm.html"><i>strxfrm</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/wcscoll.html"><i>wcscoll</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/wcsxfrm.html"><i>wcsxfrm</i>()</a> functions in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<p>A collation sequence definition shall define the relative order between collating elements (characters and multi-character
collating elements) in the locale. This order is expressed in terms of collation values; that is, by assigning each element one or
more collation values (also known as collation weights). This does not imply that implementations shall assign such values, but
that ordering of strings using the resultant collation definition in the locale behaves as if such assignment is done and used in
the collation process. At least the following capabilities are provided:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Multi-character collating elements</b>. Specification of multi-character collating elements (that is, sequences of two or
more characters to be collated as an entity).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>User-defined ordering of collating elements</b>. Each collating element shall be assigned a collation value defining its
order in the character (or basic) collation sequence. This ordering is used by regular expressions and pattern matching and, unless
collation weights are explicitly specified, also as the collation weight to be used in sorting.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Multiple weights and equivalence classes</b>. Collating elements can be assigned one or more (up to the limit
{COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX}, as defined in <a href="limits.h.html"><i>&lt;limits.h&gt;</i></a> ) collating weights for use in sorting. The
first weight is hereafter referred to as the primary weight.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>One-to-many mapping</b>. A single character is mapped into a string of collating elements.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Equivalence class definition</b>. Two or more collating elements have the same collation value (primary weight).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Ordering by weights</b>. When two strings are compared to determine their relative order, the two strings are first broken up
into a series of collating elements; the elements in each successive pair of elements are then compared according to the relative
primary weights for the elements. If equal, and more than one weight has been assigned, then the pairs of collating elements are
re-compared according to the relative subsequent weights, until either a pair of collating elements compare unequal or the weights
are exhausted.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The following keywords shall be recognized in a collation sequence definition. They are described in detail in the following
sections.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>copy</b></dt>

<dd>Specify the name of an existing locale which shall be used as the definition of this category. If this keyword is specified, no
other keyword shall be specified.</dd>

<dt><b>collating-element</b></dt>

<dd>Define a collating-element symbol representing a multi-character collating element. This keyword is optional.</dd>

<dt><b>collating-symbol</b></dt>

<dd>Define a collating symbol for use in collation order statements. This keyword is optional.</dd>

<dt><b>order_start</b></dt>

<dd>Define collation rules. This statement shall be followed by one or more collation order statements, assigning character
collation values and collation weights to collating elements.</dd>

<dt><b>order_end</b></dt>

<dd>Specify the end of the collation-order statements.</dd>
</dl>

<h5><a name="tag_07_03_02_01"></a>The collating-element Keyword</h5>

<p>In addition to the collating elements in the character set, the <b>collating-element</b> keyword can be used to define
multi-character collating elements. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>"collating-element %s from \"%s\"\n", &lt;</tt><i>collating-symbol</i><tt>&gt;, &lt;</tt><i>string</i><tt>&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt; operand shall be a symbolic name, enclosed between angle brackets ( <tt>'&lt;'</tt> and
<tt>'&gt;'</tt> ), and shall not duplicate any symbolic name in the current charmap file (if any), or any other symbolic name
defined in this collation definition. The string operand is a string of two or more characters that collates as an entity. A
&lt;<i>collating-element</i>&gt; defined via this keyword is only recognized with the <i>LC_COLLATE</i> category.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>collating-element &lt;ch&gt; from "&lt;c&gt;&lt;h&gt;"
collating-element &lt;e-acute&gt; from "&lt;acute&gt;&lt;e&gt;"
collating-element &lt;ll&gt; from "ll"
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h5><a name="tag_07_03_02_02"></a>The collating-symbol Keyword</h5>

<p>This keyword shall be used to define symbols for use in collation sequence statements; that is, between the <b>order_start</b>
and the <b>order_end</b> keywords. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>"collating-symbol %s\n", &lt;</tt><i>collating-symbol</i><tt>&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt; shall be a symbolic name, enclosed between angle brackets ( <tt>'&lt;'</tt> and
<tt>'&gt;'</tt> ), and shall not duplicate any symbolic name in the current charmap file (if any), or any other symbolic name
defined in this collation definition. A &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt; defined via this keyword is only recognized within the
<i>LC_COLLATE</i> category.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>collating-symbol &lt;UPPER_CASE&gt;
collating-symbol &lt;HIGH&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The <b>collating-symbol</b> keyword defines a symbolic name that can be associated with a relative position in the character
order sequence. While such a symbolic name does not represent any collating element, it can be used as a weight.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_07_03_02_03"></a>The order_start Keyword</h5>

<p>The <b>order_start</b> keyword shall precede collation order entries and also define the number of weights for this collation
sequence definition and other collation rules. The syntax is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>"order_start %s;%s;...;%s\n", &lt;</tt><i>sort-rules</i><tt>&gt;, &lt;</tt><i>sort-rules</i><tt>&gt; ...
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The operands to the <b>order_start</b> keyword are optional. If present, the operands define rules to be applied when strings
are compared. The number of operands define how many weights each element is assigned; if no operands are present, one
<b>forward</b> operand is assumed. If present, the first operand defines rules to be applied when comparing strings using the first
(primary) weight; the second when comparing strings using the second weight, and so on. Operands shall be separated by semicolons (
<tt>';'</tt> ). Each operand shall consist of one or more collation directives, separated by commas ( <tt>','</tt> ). If the number
of operands exceeds the {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX} limit, the utility shall issue a warning message. The following directives shall be
supported:</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>forward</b></dt>

<dd>Specifies that comparison operations for the weight level shall proceed from start of string towards the end of string.</dd>

<dt><b>backward</b></dt>

<dd>Specifies that comparison operations for the weight level shall proceed from end of string towards the beginning of
string.</dd>

<dt><b>position</b></dt>

<dd>Specifies that comparison operations for the weight level shall consider the relative position of elements in the strings not
subject to <b>IGNORE</b>. The string containing an element not subject to <b>IGNORE</b> after the fewest collating elements subject
to <b>IGNORE</b> from the start of the compare shall collate first. If both strings contain a character not subject to
<b>IGNORE</b> in the same relative position, the collating values assigned to the elements shall determine the ordering. In case of
equality, subsequent characters not subject to <b>IGNORE</b> shall be considered in the same manner.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The directives <b>forward</b> and <b>backward</b> are mutually-exclusive.</p>

<p>If no operands are specified, a single <b>forward</b> operand shall be assumed.<br>
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>order_start    forward;backward
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h5><a name="tag_07_03_02_04"></a>Collation Order</h5>

<p>The <b>order_start</b> keyword shall be followed by collating identifier entries. The syntax for the collating element entries
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>"%s %s;%s;...;%s\n", &lt;</tt><i>collating-identifier</i><tt>&gt;, &lt;</tt><i>weight</i><tt>&gt;, &lt;</tt><i>weight</i><tt>&gt;, ...
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Each <i>collating-identifier</i> shall consist of either a character (in any of the forms defined in <a href="#tag_07_03">Locale
Definition</a> ), a &lt;<i>collating-element</i>&gt;, a &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt;, an ellipsis, or the special symbol
<b>UNDEFINED</b>. The order in which collating elements are specified determines the character order sequence, such that each
collating element shall compare less than the elements following it.</p>

<p>A &lt;<i>collating-element</i>&gt; shall be used to specify multi-character collating elements, and indicates that the character
sequence specified via the &lt;<i>collating-element</i>&gt; is to be collated as a unit and in the relative order specified by its
place.</p>

<p>A &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt; can be used to define a position in the relative order for use in weights. No weights shall be
specified with a &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt;.</p>

<p>The ellipsis symbol specifies that a sequence of characters shall collate according to their encoded character values. It shall
be interpreted as indicating that all characters with a coded character set value higher than the value of the character in the
preceding line, and lower than the coded character set value for the character in the following line, in the current coded
character set, shall be placed in the character collation order between the previous and the following character in ascending order
according to their coded character set values. An initial ellipsis shall be interpreted as if the preceding line specified the NUL
character, and a trailing ellipsis as if the following line specified the highest coded character set value in the current coded
character set. An ellipsis shall be treated as invalid if the preceding or following lines do not specify characters in the current
coded character set. The use of the ellipsis symbol ties the definition to a specific coded character set and may preclude the
definition from being portable between implementations.</p>

<p>The symbol <b>UNDEFINED</b> shall be interpreted as including all coded character set values not specified explicitly or via the
ellipsis symbol. Such characters shall be inserted in the character collation order at the point indicated by the symbol, and in
ascending order according to their coded character set values. If no <b>UNDEFINED</b> symbol is specified, and the current coded
character set contains characters not specified in this section, the utility shall issue a warning message and place such
characters at the end of the character collation order.</p>

<p>The optional operands for each collation-element shall be used to define the primary, secondary, or subsequent weights for the
collating element. The first operand specifies the relative primary weight, the second the relative secondary weight, and so on.
Two or more collation-elements can be assigned the same weight; they belong to the same &quot;equivalence class&quot; if they have the same
primary weight. Collation shall behave as if, for each weight level, elements subject to <b>IGNORE</b> are removed, unless the
<b>position</b> collation directive is specified for the corresponding level with the <b>order_start</b> keyword. Then each
successive pair of elements shall be compared according to the relative weights for the elements. If the two strings compare equal,
the process shall be repeated for the next weight level, up to the limit {COLL_WEIGHTS_MAX}.</p>

<p>Weights shall be expressed as characters (in any of the forms specified in <a href="#tag_07_03">Locale Definition</a> ),
&lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt;s, &lt;<i>collating-element</i>&gt;s, an ellipsis, or the special symbol <b>IGNORE</b>. A single
character, a &lt;<i>collating-symbol</i>&gt;, or a &lt;<i>collating-element</i>&gt; shall represent the relative position in the
character collating sequence of the character or symbol, rather than the character or characters themselves. Thus, rather than
assigning absolute values to weights, a particular weight is expressed using the relative order value assigned to a collating
element based on its order in the character collation sequence.</p>

<p>One-to-many mapping is indicated by specifying two or more concatenated characters or symbolic names. For example, if the
&lt;eszet&gt; is given the string <tt>"&lt;s&gt;&lt;s&gt;"</tt> as a weight, comparisons are performed as if all occurrences of the
&lt;eszet&gt; are replaced by <tt>"&lt;s&gt;&lt;s&gt;"</tt> (assuming that <tt>"&lt;s&gt;"</tt> has the collating weight
<tt>"&lt;s&gt;"</tt> ). If it is necessary to define &lt;eszet&gt; and <tt>"&lt;s&gt;&lt;s&gt;"</tt> as an equivalence class, then
a collating element must be defined for the string <tt>"ss"</tt> .</p>

<p>All characters specified via an ellipsis shall by default be assigned unique weights, equal to the relative order of characters.
Characters specified via an explicit or implicit <b>UNDEFINED</b> special symbol shall by default be assigned the same primary
weight (that is, they belong to the same equivalence class). An ellipsis symbol as a weight shall be interpreted to mean that each
character in the sequence shall have unique weights, equal to the relative order of their character in the character collation
sequence. The use of the ellipsis as a weight shall be treated as an error if the collating element is neither an ellipsis nor the
special symbol <b>UNDEFINED</b>.</p>

<p>The special keyword <b>IGNORE</b> as a weight shall indicate that when strings are compared using the weights at the level where
<b>IGNORE</b> is specified, the collating element shall be ignored; that is, as if the string did not contain the collating
element. In regular expressions and pattern matching, all characters that are subject to <b>IGNORE</b> in their primary weight form
an equivalence class.</p>

<p>An empty operand shall be interpreted as the collating element itself.</p>

<p>For example, the order statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;a&gt;    &lt;a&gt;;&lt;a&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>is equal to:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>&lt;a&gt;
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>An ellipsis can be used as an operand if the collating element was an ellipsis, and shall be interpreted as the value of each
character defined by the ellipsis.</p>

<p>The collation order as defined in this section affects the interpretation of bracket expressions in regular expressions (see <a
href="xbd_chap09.html#tag_09_03_05"><i>RE Bracket Expression</i></a> ).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<tt>order_start  forward;backward
UNDEFINED    IGNORE;IGNORE
&lt;LOW&gt;
&lt;space&gt;      &lt;LOW&gt;;&lt;space&gt;
...          &lt;LOW&gt;;...
&lt;a&gt;          &lt;a&gt;;&lt;a&gt;
&lt;a-acute&gt;    &lt;a&gt;;&lt;a-acute&gt;
&lt;a-grave&gt;    &lt;a&gt;;&lt;a-grave&gt;
&lt;A&gt;          &lt;a&gt;;&lt;A&gt;
&lt;A-acute&gt;    &lt;a&gt;;&lt;A-acute&gt;
&lt;A-grave&gt;    &lt;a&gt;;&lt;A-grave&gt;
&lt;ch&gt;         &lt;ch&gt;;&lt;ch&gt;
&lt;Ch&gt;         &lt;ch&gt;;&lt;Ch&gt;
&lt;s&gt;          &lt;s&gt;;&lt;s&gt;
&lt;eszet&gt;      "&lt;s&gt;&lt;s&gt;";"&lt;eszet&gt;&lt;eszet&gt;"
order_end
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This example is interpreted as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The <b>UNDEFINED</b> means that all characters not specified in this definition (explicitly or via the ellipsis) shall be
ignored for collation purposes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All characters between &lt;space&gt; and <tt>'a'</tt> shall have the same primary equivalence class and individual secondary
weights based on their ordinal encoded values.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>All characters based on the uppercase or lowercase character <tt>'a'</tt> belong to the same primary equivalence class.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The multi-character collating element &lt;ch&gt; is represented by the collating symbol &lt;ch&gt; and belongs to the same
primary equivalence class as the multi-character collating element &lt;Ch&gt;.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h5><a name="tag_07_03_02_05"></a>The order_end Keyword</h5>

<p>The collating order entries shall be terminated with an <b>order_end</b> keyword.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_07_04"></a>Locale Definition Grammar</h3>

<p>The grammar and lexical conventions in this section shall together describe the syntax for the locale definition source. The
general conventions for this style of grammar are described in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a
href="../utilities/xcu_chap01.html#tag_01_10">Section 1.10, Grammar Conventions</a>. The grammar shall take precedence over the
text in this chapter.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_07_04_01"></a>Locale Lexical Conventions</h4>

<p>The lexical conventions for the locale definition grammar are described in this section.</p>

<p>The following tokens shall be processed (in addition to those string constants shown in the grammar):</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>LOC_NAME</b></dt>

<dd>A string of characters representing the name of a locale.</dd>

<dt><b>CHAR</b></dt>

<dd>Any single character.</dd>

<dt><b>NUMBER</b></dt>

<dd>A decimal number, represented by one or more decimal digits.</dd>

<dt><b>COLLSYMBOL</b></dt>

<dd>A symbolic name, enclosed between angle brackets. The string cannot duplicate any charmap symbol defined in the current charmap
(if any), or a <b>COLLELEMENT</b> symbol.</dd>

<dt><b>COLLELEMENT</b></dt>

<dd>A symbolic name, enclosed between angle brackets, which cannot duplicate either any charmap symbol or a <b>COLLSYMBOL</b>
symbol.</dd>

<dt><b>CHARCLASS</b></dt>

<dd>A string of alphanumeric characters from the portable character set, the first of which is not a digit, consisting of at least
one and at most {CHARCLASS_NAME_MAX} bytes, and optionally surrounded by double-quotes.</dd>

<dt><b>CHARSYMBOL</b></dt>

<dd>A symbolic name, enclosed between angle brackets, from the current charmap (if any).</dd>

<dt><b>OCTAL_CHAR</b></dt>

<dd>One or more octal representations of the encoding of each byte in a single character. The octal representation consists of an
escape character (normally a backslash) followed by two or more octal digits.</dd>

<dt><b>HEX_CHAR</b></dt>

<dd>One or more hexadecimal representations of the encoding of each byte in a single character. The hexadecimal representation
consists of an escape character followed by the constant <i>x</i> and two or more hexadecimal digits.</dd>

<dt><b>DECIMAL_CHAR</b></dt>

<dd>One or more decimal representations of the encoding of each byte in a single character. The decimal representation consists of
an escape character followed by a character <tt>'d'</tt> and two or more decimal digits.</dd>

<dt><b>ELLIPSIS</b></dt>

<dd>The string <tt>"..."</tt> .</dd>

<dt><b>EXTENDED_REG_EXP</b></dt>

<dd>An extended regular expression as defined in the grammar in <a href="xbd_chap09.html#tag_09_05"><i>Regular Expression
