<h2><a name="tag_04"></a>General Concepts</h2>

<p>For the purposes of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, the general concepts given in <a href="#tag_04">General Concepts</a> apply.

<h3><a name="tag_04_01"></a>Concurrent Execution</h3>

<p>Functions that suspend the execution of the calling thread shall not cause the execution of other threads to be indefinitely
suspended.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_02"></a>Directory Protection</h3>

<p>If a directory is writable and the mode bit S_ISVTX is set on the directory, a process may remove or rename files within that
directory only if one or more of the following is true:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The effective user ID of the process is the same as that of the owner ID of the file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The effective user ID of the process is the same as that of the owner ID of the directory.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The process has appropriate privileges.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>If the S_ISVTX bit is set on a non-directory file, the behavior is unspecified.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_03"></a>Extended Security Controls</h3>

<p>An implementation may provide implementation-defined extended security controls (see <a href=
"xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_159"><i>Extended Security Controls</i></a> ). These permit an implementation to provide security mechanisms
to implement different security policies than those described in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001. These mechanisms shall not alter
or override the defined semantics of any of the interfaces in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_04"></a>File Access Permissions</h3>

<p>The standard file access control mechanism uses the file permission bits, as described below.</p>

<p>Implementations may provide <i>additional</i> or <i>alternate</i> file access control mechanisms, or both. An additional access
control mechanism shall only further restrict the access permissions defined by the file permission bits. An alternate file access
control mechanism shall:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Specify file permission bits for the file owner class, file group class, and file other class of that file, corresponding to the
access permissions.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be enabled only by explicit user action, on a per-file basis by the file owner or a user with the appropriate privilege.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Be disabled for a file after the file permission bits are changed for that file with <a href=
"../functions/chmod.html"><i>chmod</i>()</a>. The disabling of the alternate mechanism need not disable any additional mechanisms
supported by an implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever a process requests file access permission for read, write, or execute/search, if no additional mechanism denies access,
access shall be determined as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If a process has the appropriate privilege:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If read, write, or directory search permission is requested, access shall be granted.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If execute permission is requested, access shall be granted if execute permission is granted to at least one user by the file
permission bits or by an alternate access control mechanism; otherwise, access shall be denied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>Otherwise:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The file permission bits of a file contain read, write, and execute/search permissions for the file owner class, file group
class, and file other class.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Access shall be granted if an alternate access control mechanism is not enabled and the requested access permission bit is set
for the class (file owner class, file group class, or file other class) to which the process belongs, or if an alternate access
control mechanism is enabled and it allows the requested access; otherwise, access shall be denied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tag_04_05"></a>File Hierarchy</h3>

<p>Files in the system are organized in a hierarchical structure in which all of the non-terminal nodes are directories and all of
the terminal nodes are any other type of file. Since multiple directory entries may refer to the same file, the hierarchy is
properly described as a &quot;directed graph&quot;.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_06"></a>Filenames</h3>

<p>For a filename to be portable across implementations conforming to IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, it shall consist only of the
portable filename character set as defined in <a href="xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_276"><i>Portable Filename Character Set</i></a> .</p>

<p>The hyphen character shall not be used as the first character of a portable filename. Uppercase and lowercase letters shall
retain their unique identities between conforming implementations. In the case of a portable pathname, the slash character may also
be used.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_07"></a>File Times Update</h3>

<p>Each file has three distinct associated time values: <i>st_atime</i>, <i>st_mtime</i>, and <i>st_ctime</i>. The <i>st_atime</i>
field is associated with the times that the file data is accessed; <i>st_mtime</i> is associated with the times that the file data
is modified; and <i>st_ctime</i> is associated with the times that the file status is changed. These values are returned in the
file characteristics structure, as described in <a href="sys/stat.h.html"><i>&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;</i></a> .</p>

<p>Each function or utility in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 that reads or writes data or changes file status indicates which of
the appropriate time-related fields shall be &quot;marked for update&quot;. If an implementation of such a function or utility marks for
update a time-related field not specified by IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, this shall be documented, except that any changes
caused by pathname resolution need not be documented. For the other functions or utilities in IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 (those
that are not explicitly required to read or write file data or change file status, but that in some implementations happen to do
so), the effect is unspecified.</p>

<p>An implementation may update fields that are marked for update immediately, or it may update such fields periodically. At an
update point in time, any marked fields shall be set to the current time and the update marks shall be cleared. All fields that are
marked for update shall be updated when the file ceases to be open by any process, or when a <a href=
"../functions/stat.html"><i>stat</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/fstat.html"><i>fstat</i>()</a>, or <a href=
"../functions/lstat.html"><i>lstat</i>()</a> is performed on the file. Other times at which updates are done are unspecified. Marks
for update, and updates themselves, are not done for files on read-only file systems; see <a href=
"xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_304"><i>Read-Only File System</i></a> .</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_08"></a>Host and Network Byte Orders</h3>

<p>When data is transmitted over the network, it is sent as a sequence of octets (8-bit unsigned values). If an entity (such as an
address or a port number) can be larger than 8 bits, it needs to be stored in several octets. The convention is that all such
values are stored with 8 bits in each octet, and with the first (lowest-addressed) octet holding the most-significant bits. This is
called &quot;network byte order&quot;.</p>

<p>Network byte order may not be convenient for processing actual values. For this, it is more sensible for values to be stored as
ordinary integers. This is known as &quot;host byte order&quot;. In host byte order:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The most significant bit might not be stored in the first byte in address order.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Bits might not be allocated to bytes in any obvious order at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>8-bit values stored in <b>uint8_t</b> objects do not require conversion to or from host byte order, as they have the same
representation. 16 and 32-bit values can be converted using the <a href="../functions/htonl.html"><i>htonl</i>()</a>, <a href=
"../functions/htons.html"><i>htons</i>()</a>, <a href="../functions/ntohl.html"><i>ntohl</i>()</a>, and <a href=
"../functions/ntohs.html"><i>ntohs</i>()</a> functions. When reading data that is to be converted to host byte order, it should
either be received directly into a <b>uint16_t</b> or <b>uint32_t</b> object or should be copied from an array of bytes using <a
href="../functions/memcpy.html"><i>memcpy</i>()</a> or similar. Passing the data through other types could cause the byte order to
be changed. Similar considerations apply when sending data.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_09"></a>Measurement of Execution Time</h3>

<p>The mechanism used to measure execution time shall be implementation-defined. The implementation shall also define to whom the
CPU time that is consumed by interrupt handlers and system services on behalf of the operating system will be charged. See <a href=
"xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_117"><i>CPU Time (Execution Time)</i></a> .</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_10"></a>Memory Synchronization</h3>

<p>Applications shall ensure that access to any memory location by more than one thread of control (threads or processes) is
restricted such that no thread of control can read or modify a memory location while another thread of control may be modifying it.
Such access is restricted using functions that synchronize thread execution and also synchronize memory with respect to other
threads. The following functions synchronize memory with respect to other threads:</p>

<p>Unless explicitly stated otherwise, if one of the above functions returns an error, it is unspecified whether the invocation
causes memory to be synchronized.</p>

<p>Applications may allow more than one thread of control to read a memory location simultaneously.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_11"></a>Pathname Resolution</h3>

<p>Pathname resolution is performed for a process to resolve a pathname to a particular file in a file hierarchy. There may be
multiple pathnames that resolve to the same file.</p>

<p>Each filename in the pathname is located in the directory specified by its predecessor (for example, in the pathname fragment
<b>a/b</b>, file <b>b</b> is located in directory <b>a</b>). Pathname resolution shall fail if this cannot be accomplished. If the
pathname begins with a slash, the predecessor of the first filename in the pathname shall be taken to be the root directory of the
process (such pathnames are referred to as &quot;absolute pathnames&quot;). If the pathname does not begin with a slash, the predecessor of
the first filename of the pathname shall be taken to be the current working directory of the process (such pathnames are referred
to as &quot;relative pathnames&quot;).</p>

<p>The interpretation of a pathname component is dependent on the value of {NAME_MAX} and _POSIX_NO_TRUNC associated with the path
prefix of that component. If any pathname component is longer than {NAME_MAX}, the implementation shall consider this an error.</p>

<p>A pathname that contains at least one non-slash character and that ends with one or more trailing slashes shall be resolved as
if a single dot character ( <tt>'.'</tt> ) were appended to the pathname.</p>

<p>If a symbolic link is encountered during pathname resolution, the behavior shall depend on whether the pathname component is at
the end of the pathname and on the function being performed. If all of the following are true, then pathname resolution is
complete:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>This is the last pathname component of the pathname.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The pathname has no trailing slash.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The function is required to act on the symbolic link itself, or certain arguments direct that the function act on the symbolic
link itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>In all other cases, the system shall prefix the remaining pathname, if any, with the contents of the symbolic link. If the
combined length exceeds {PATH_MAX}, and the implementation considers this to be an error, <i>errno</i> shall be set to
[ENAMETOOLONG] and an error indication shall be returned. Otherwise, the resolved pathname shall be the resolution of the pathname
just created. If the resulting pathname does not begin with a slash, the predecessor of the first filename of the pathname is taken
to be the directory containing the symbolic link.</p>

<p>If the system detects a loop in the pathname resolution process, it shall set <i>errno</i> to [ELOOP] and return an error
indication. The same may happen if during the resolution process more symbolic links were followed than the implementation allows.
This implementation-defined limit shall not be smaller than {SYMLOOP_MAX}.</p>

<p>The special filename dot shall refer to the directory specified by its predecessor. The special filename dot-dot shall refer to
the parent directory of its predecessor directory. As a special case, in the root directory, dot-dot may refer to the root
directory itself.</p>

<p>A pathname consisting of a single slash shall resolve to the root directory of the process. A null pathname shall not be
successfully resolved. A pathname that begins with two successive slashes may be interpreted in an implementation-defined manner,
although more than two leading slashes shall be treated as a single slash.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_12"></a>Process ID Reuse</h3>

<p>A process group ID shall not be reused by the system until the process group lifetime ends.</p>

<p>A process ID shall not be reused by the system until the process lifetime ends. In addition, if there exists a process group
whose process group ID is equal to that process ID, the process ID shall not be reused by the system until the process group
lifetime ends. A process that is not a system process shall not have a process ID of 1.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_13"></a>Scheduling Policy</h3>

<p>A scheduling policy affects process or thread ordering:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When a process or thread is a running thread and it becomes a blocked thread</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When a process or thread is a running thread and it becomes a preempted thread</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When a process or thread is a blocked thread and it becomes a runnable thread</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>When a running thread calls a function that can change the priority or scheduling policy of a process or thread</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>In other scheduling policy-defined circumstances</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Conforming implementations shall define the manner in which each of the scheduling policies may modify the priorities or
otherwise affect the ordering of processes or threads at each of the occurrences listed above. Additionally, conforming
implementations shall define in what other circumstances and in what manner each scheduling policy may modify the priorities or
affect the ordering of processes or threads.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_14"></a>Seconds Since the Epoch</h3>

<p>A value that approximates the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Epoch. A Coordinated Universal Time name (specified
in terms of seconds (<i>tm_sec</i>), minutes (<i>tm_min</i>), hours (<i>tm_hour</i>), days since January 1 of the year
(<i>tm_yday</i>), and calendar year minus 1900 (<i>tm_year</i>)) is related to a time represented as seconds since the Epoch,
according to the expression below.</p>

<p>If the year is &lt;1970 or the value is negative, the relationship is undefined. If the year is &gt;=1970 and the value is
non-negative, the value is related to a Coordinated Universal Time name according to the C-language expression, where
<i>tm_sec</i>, <i>tm_min</i>, <i>tm_hour</i>, <i>tm_yday</i>, and <i>tm_year</i> are all integer types:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>tm_sec</i> <tt>+</tt> <i>tm_min</i><tt>*60 +</tt> <i>tm_hour</i><tt>*3600 +</tt> <i>tm_yday</i><tt>*86400 +
    (</tt><i>tm_year</i><tt>-70)*31536000 + ((</tt><i>tm_year</i><tt>-69)/4)*86400 -
    ((</tt><i>tm_year</i><tt>-1)/100)*86400 + ((</tt><i>tm_year</i><tt>+299)/400)*86400
</tt>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The relationship between the actual time of day and the current value for seconds since the Epoch is unspecified.</p>

<p>How any changes to the value of seconds since the Epoch are made to align to a desired relationship with the current actual time
are made is implementation-defined. As represented in seconds since the Epoch, each and every day shall be accounted for by exactly
86400 seconds. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>The last three terms of the expression add in a day for each year that follows a leap year starting with the first leap year
since the Epoch. The first term adds a day every 4 years starting in 1973, the second subtracts a day back out every 100 years
starting in 2001, and the third adds a day back in every 400 years starting in 2001. The divisions in the formula are integer
divisions; that is, the remainder is discarded leaving only the integer quotient.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<h3><a name="tag_04_15"></a>Semaphore</h3>

<p>A minimum synchronization primitive to serve as a basis for more complex synchronization mechanisms to be defined by the
application program.</p>

<p>For the semaphores associated with the Semaphores option, a semaphore is represented as a shareable resource that has a
non-negative integer value. When the value is zero, there is a (possibly empty) set of threads awaiting the availability of the
semaphore.</p>

<p>For the semaphores associated with the X/Open System Interface Extension (XSI), a semaphore is a positive integer (0 through
32767). The <a href="../functions/semget.html"><i>semget</i>()</a> function can be called to create a set or array of semaphores. A
semaphore set can contain one or more semaphores up to an implementation-defined value.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_15_00_01"></a>Semaphore Lock Operation</h5>

<p>An operation that is applied to a semaphore. If, prior to the operation, the value of the semaphore is zero, the semaphore lock
operation shall cause the calling thread to be blocked and added to the set of threads awaiting the semaphore; otherwise, the value
shall be decremented.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_15_00_02"></a>Semaphore Unlock Operation</h5>

<p>An operation that is applied to a semaphore. If, prior to the operation, there are any threads in the set of threads awaiting
the semaphore, then some thread from that set shall be removed from the set and becomes unblocked; otherwise, the semaphore value
shall be incremented.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_16"></a>Thread-Safety</h3>

<p>Refer to the System Interfaces volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href="../functions/xsh_chap02_09.html">Section 2.9,
Threads</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_17"></a>Tracing</h3>

<p>The trace system allows a traced process to have a selection of events created for it. Traces consist of streams of trace event
types.</p>

<p>A trace event type is identified on the one hand by a trace event type name, also referenced as a trace event name, and on the
other hand by a trace event type identifier. A trace event name is a human-readable string. A trace event type identifier is an
opaque identifier used by the trace system. There shall be a one-to-one relationship between trace event type identifiers and trace
event names for a given trace stream and also for a given traced process. The trace event type identifier shall be generated
automatically from a trace event name by the trace system either when a trace controller process invokes <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_trid_eventid_open.html"><i>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</i>()</a> or when an instrumented application
process invokes <a href="../functions/posix_trace_eventid_open.html"><i>posix_trace_eventid_open</i>()</a>. Trace event type
identifiers are used to filter trace event types, to allow interpretation of user data, and to identify the kind of trace point
that generated a trace event.</p>

<p>Each trace event shall be of a particular trace event type, and associated with a trace event type identifier. The execution of
a trace point shall generate a trace event if a trace stream has been created and started for the process that executed the trace
point and if the corresponding trace event type identifier is not ignored by filtering.</p>

<p>A generated trace event shall be recorded in a trace stream, and optionally also in a trace log if a trace log is associated
with the trace stream, except that:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For a trace stream, if no resources are available for the event, the event is lost.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For a trace log, if no resources are available for the event, or a flush operation does not succeed, the event is lost.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A trace event recorded in an active trace stream may be retrieved by an application having the appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>A trace event recorded in a trace log may be retrieved by an application having the appropriate privileges after opening the
trace log as a pre-recorded trace stream, with the function <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_open.html"><i>posix_trace_open</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>When a trace event is reported it is possible to retrieve the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>A trace event type identifier</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>A timestamp</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The process ID of the traced process, if the trace event is process-dependent</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Any optional trace event data including its length</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Threads option is supported, the thread ID, if the trace event is process-dependent</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The program address at which the trace point was invoked</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Trace events may be mapped from trace event types to trace event names. One such mapping shall be associated with each trace
stream. An active trace stream is associated with a traced process, and also with its children if the Trace Inherit option is
supported and also the inheritance policy is set to _POSIX_TRACE_INHERIT. Therefore each traced process has a mapping of the trace
event names to trace event type identifiers that have been defined for that process.</p>

<p>Traces can be recorded into either trace streams or trace logs.</p>

<p>The implementation and format of a trace stream are unspecified. A trace stream need not be and generally is not persistent. A
trace stream may be either active or pre-recorded:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An active trace stream is a trace stream that has been created and has not yet been shut down. It can be of one of the two
following classes:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>An active trace stream without a trace log that was created with the <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_create.html"><i>posix_trace_create</i>()</a> function</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Trace Log option is supported, an active trace stream with a trace log that was created with the <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_create_withlog.html"><i>posix_trace_create_withlog</i>()</a> function</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>A pre-recorded trace stream is a trace stream that was opened from a trace log object using the <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_open.html"><i>posix_trace_open</i>()</a> function.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>An active trace stream can loop. This behavior means that when the resources allocated by the trace system for the trace stream
are exhausted, the trace system reuses the resources associated with the oldest recorded trace events to record new trace
events.</p>

<p>If the Trace Log option is supported, an active trace stream with a trace log can be flushed. This operation causes the trace
system to write trace events from the trace stream to the associated trace log, following the defined policies or using an explicit
function call. After this operation, the trace system may reuse the resources associated with the flushed trace events.</p>

<p>An active trace stream with or without a trace log can be cleared. This operation shall cause all the resources associated with
this trace stream to be reinitialized. The trace stream shall behave as if it was returning from its creation, except that the
mapping of trace event type identifiers to trace event names shall not be cleared. If a trace log was associated with this trace
stream, the trace log shall also be reinitialized.</p>

<p>A trace log shall be recorded when the <a href="../functions/posix_trace_shutdown.html"><i>posix_trace_shutdown</i>()</a>
operation is invoked or during tracing, depending on the tracing strategy which is defined by a log policy. After the trace stream
has been shut down, the trace information can be retrieved from the associated trace log using the same interface used to retrieve
information from an active trace stream.</p>

<p>For a traced process, if the Trace Inherit option is supported and the trace stream's inheritance attribute is
_POSIX_TRACE_INHERIT, the initial targeted traced process shall be traced together with all of its future children. The
<i>posix_pid</i> member of each trace event in a trace stream shall be the process ID of the traced process.</p>

<p>Each trace point may be an implementation-defined action such as a context switch, or an application-programmed action such as a
call to a specific operating system service (for example, <a href="../functions/fork.html"><i>fork</i>()</a>) or a call to <a href=
"../functions/posix_trace_event.html"><i>posix_trace_event</i>()</a>.</p>

<p>Trace points may be filtered. The operation of the filter is to filter out (ignore) selected trace events. By default, no trace
events are filtered.</p>

<p>The results of the tracing operations can be analyzed and monitored by a trace controller process or a trace analyzer
process.</p>

<p>Only the trace controller process has control of the trace stream it has created. The control of the operation of a trace stream
is done using its corresponding trace stream identifier. The trace controller process is able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Initialize the attributes of a trace stream</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Create the trace stream</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Start and stop tracing</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Know the mapping of the traced process</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If the Trace Event Filter option is supported, filter the type of trace events to be recorded</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Shut the trace stream down</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>A traced process may also be a trace controller process. Only the trace controller process can control its trace stream(s). A
trace stream created by a trace controller process shall be shut down if its controller process terminates or executes another
file.</p>

<p>A trace controller process may also be a trace analyzer process. Trace analysis can be done concurrently with the traced process
or can be done off-line, in the same or in a different platform.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_18"></a>Treatment of Error Conditions for Mathematical Functions</h3>

<p>For all the functions in the <a href="../basedefs/math.h.html"><i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i></a> header, an application wishing to check
for error situations should set <i>errno</i> to 0 and call <i>feclearexcept</i>(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling the function. On
return, if <i>errno</i> is non-zero or <i>fetestexcept</i>( FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an
error has occurred.</p>

<p>The following error conditions are defined for all functions in the <a href="../basedefs/math.h.html"><i>&lt;math.h&gt;</i></a>
header.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_18_01"></a>Domain Error</h4>

<p>A &quot;domain error&quot; shall occur if an input argument is outside the domain over which the mathematical function is defined. The
description of each function lists any required domain errors; an implementation may define additional domain errors, provided that
such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function.</p>

<p>On a domain error, the function shall return an implementation-defined value; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, <i>errno</i> shall be set to [EDOM]; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) is
non-zero, the &quot;invalid&quot; floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_18_02"></a>Pole Error</h4>

<p>A &quot;pole error&quot; occurs if the mathematical result of the function is an exact infinity (for example, log(0.0)).</p>

<p>On a pole error, the function shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL according to the return
type, with the same sign as the correct value of the function; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) is
non-zero, <i>errno</i> shall be set to [ERANGE]; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, the
&quot;divide-by-zero&quot; floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_04_18_03"></a>Range Error</h4>

<p>A &quot;range error&quot; shall occur if the finite mathematical result of the function cannot be represented in an object of the
specified type, due to extreme magnitude.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_18_03_01"></a>Result Overflows</h5>

<p>A floating result overflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is finite but so large that the mathematical result
cannot be represented without extraordinary roundoff error in an object of the specified type. If a floating result overflows and
default rounding is in effect, then the function shall return the value of the macro HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALF, or HUGE_VALL according to
the return type, with the same sign as the correct value of the function; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp;
MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, <i>errno</i> shall be set to [ERANGE]; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT)
is non-zero, the &quot;overflow&quot; floating-point exception shall be raised.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_04_18_03_02"></a>Result Underflows</h5>

<p>The result underflows if the magnitude of the mathematical result is so small that the mathematical result cannot be
represented, without extraordinary roundoff error, in an object of the specified type. If the result underflows, the function shall
return an implementation-defined value whose magnitude is no greater than the smallest normalized positive number in the specified
type; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, whether <i>errno</i> is set to [ERANGE] is
implementation-defined; if the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, whether the &quot;underflow''
floating-point exception is raised is implementation-defined.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_19"></a>Treatment of NaN Arguments for the Mathematical Functions</h3>

<p>For functions called with a NaN argument, no errors shall occur and a NaN shall be returned, except where stated otherwise.</p>

<p>If a function with one or more NaN arguments returns a NaN result, the result should be the same as one of the NaN arguments
(after possible type conversion), except perhaps for the sign.</p>

<p>On implementations that support the IEC&nbsp;60559:1989 standard floating point, functions with signaling NaN argument(s) shall
be treated as if the function were called with an argument that is a required domain error and shall return a quiet NaN result,
except where stated otherwise. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>The function might never see the signaling NaN, since it might trigger when the arguments are evaluated during the function
call.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<p>On implementations that support the IEC&nbsp;60559:1989 standard floating point, for those functions that do not have a
documented domain error, the following shall apply:</p>

<blockquote>These functions shall fail if: 

<dl compact>
<dt>Domain&nbsp;Error</dt>

<dd>Any argument is a signaling NaN.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Either, the integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero and <i>errno</i> shall be set to [EDOM], or the
integer expression (math_errhandling &amp; MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero and the invalid floating-point exception shall be
raised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="tag_04_20"></a>Utility</h3>

<p>A utility program shall be either an executable file, such as might be produced by a compiler or linker system from computer
source code, or a file of shell source code, directly interpreted by the shell. The program may have been produced by the user,
provided by the system implementor, or acquired from an independent distributor.</p>

<p>The system may implement certain utilities as shell functions (see the Shell and Utilities volume of
IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href="../utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_09_05">Section 2.9.5, Function Definition Command</a>)
or built-in utilities, but only an application that is aware of the command search order described in the Shell and Utilities
volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href="../utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_09_01_01">Section 2.9.1.1, Command Search
and Execution</a> or of performance characteristics can discern differences between the behavior of such a function or built-in
utility and that of an executable file.</p>

<h3><a name="tag_04_21"></a>Variable Assignment</h3>

<p>In the shell command language, a word consisting of the following parts:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>varname</i><tt>=</tt><i>value</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>When used in a context where assignment is defined to occur and at no other time, the <i>value</i> (representing a word or
field) shall be assigned as the value of the variable denoted by <i>varname</i>. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>For further information, see the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href=
"../utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_09_01">Section 2.9.1, Simple Commands</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<p>The <i>varname</i> and <i>value</i> parts shall meet the requirements for a name and a word, respectively, except that they are
delimited by the embedded unquoted equals-sign, in addition to other delimiters. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>Additional delimiters are described in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001, <a href=
"../utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_03">Section 2.3, Token Recognition</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<basefont size="3"> 

<p>When a variable assignment is done, the variable shall be created if it did not already exist. If <i>value</i> is not specified,
the variable shall be given a null value. <basefont size="2"></p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Note:</b></dt>

<dd>An alternative form of variable assignment: 

<blockquote>
<pre>
<i>symbol</i><tt>=</tt><i>value</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>(where <i>symbol</i> is a valid word delimited by an equals-sign, but not a valid name) produces unspecified results. The form
<i>symbol</i>= <i>value</i> is used by the KornShell <i>name</i>[ <i>expression</i>]= <i>value</i> syntax.</p>
