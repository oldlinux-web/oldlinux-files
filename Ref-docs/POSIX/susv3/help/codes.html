 The functionality described is an extension to the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Application writers may make use of an extension as it is
supported on all IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001-conforming systems.</p>

<p>With each function or header from the ISO&nbsp;C standard, a statement to the effect that ``any conflict is unintentional'' is
included. That is intended to refer to a direct conflict. IEEE&nbsp;Std&nbsp;1003.1-2001 acts in part as a profile of the
ISO&nbsp;C standard, and it may choose to further constrain behaviors allowed to vary by the ISO&nbsp;C standard. Such limitations
are not considered conflicts.</p>

<h4><a name="tag_01_05_02"></a>Margin Code Notation</h4>

<p>Some of the functionality described in this standard depends on support of more than one option, or
independently may depend on several options. The HTML rendition uses
different conventions to the printed and PDF version of this standard:
shading is used in SYNOPSIS and at the start of the DESCRIPTION text only;
graphical tags are used to denote the start and end of optional text throughout
the html text.</p>
<p>
The following notation for margin codes is used to denote the following cases.</p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_01"></a>A Feature Dependent on One or Two Options</h5>

<p>In this case, margin codes have a &lt;space&gt; separator; for example:</p>

<p><span class="shade"><tt>[<a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap01.html#tag_01_05_01">MF</a>]</tt><img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> This feature requires support for only the Memory Mapped Files option.
<img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></span></p>

<p><span class="shade"><tt>[<a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap01.html#tag_01_05_01">MF SHM</a>]</tt><img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> This feature requires support for both the Memory Mapped Files and the
Shared Memory Objects options; that is, an application which uses this feature is portable only between implementations that
provide both options. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></span></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_02"></a>A Feature Dependent on Either of the Options Denoted</h5>

<p>In this case, margin codes have a <tt>'|'</tt> separator to denote the logical OR; for example:</p>

<p><span class="shade"><tt>[<a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap01.html#tag_01_05_01">MF|SHM</a>]</tt><img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> This feature is dependent on support for either the Memory Mapped Files
option or the Shared Memory Objects option; that is, an application which uses this feature is portable between implementations
that provide any (or all) of the options. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></span></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_03"></a>A Feature Dependent on More than Two Options</h5>

<p>The following shorthand notations are used:</p>

<p><span class="shade"><tt>[<a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap01.html#tag_01_05_01">MC1</a>]</tt><img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> The MC1 margin code is shorthand for ADV (&nbsp;MF&nbsp;|&nbsp;SHM&nbsp;). Features which are
marked with this margin code require support of the Advisory Information option and either the Memory Mapped Files or Shared Memory
Objects option. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></span></p>

<p><span class="shade"><tt>[<a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap01.html#tag_01_05_01">MC2</a>]</tt><img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> The MC2 margin code is shorthand for MF&nbsp;|&nbsp;SHM&nbsp;|&nbsp;MPR. Features which are
marked with this margin code require support of either the Memory Mapped Files, Shared Memory Objects, or Memory Protection
options. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></span></p>

<h5><a name="tag_01_05_02_04"></a>Large Sections Dependent on an Option</h5>

<p>Where large sections of text are dependent on support for an option, a lead-in text block is provided and marked accordingly;
for example:</p>

<p><span class="shade"><tt>[<a href="../basedefs/xbd_chap01.html#tag_01_05_01">TRC</a>]</tt><img src=
"../images/opt-start.gif" alt="[Option Start]" border="0"> This section describes extensions to support tracing of user
applications. This functionality is dependent on support of the Trace option (and the rest of this section is not further marked
for this option). <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" alt="[Option End]" border="0"></span></p>
