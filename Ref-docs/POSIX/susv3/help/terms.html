    the Web</font></h2>
    <h3><font size="3" face="Arial">An explanation and terms for
    access to HTML and PDF documents</font></h3>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We are pleased to be able to
    publish X/Open Specifications and Guides on the World Wide
    Web.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first html titles correspond to hard copy publications
    since&nbsp; January 1997.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our policy is to convert our
    Specifications into HTML 3.2 using tables and other
    facilities which can be accessed through the most popular web
    browsers. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We ask readers to give us
    their name and email address for a number of reasons: </font></p>
    <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To enable us to gauge the
            interest in any particular document/subject area</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To enable us to alert you
            to new editions of the specification</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">To enable us to send you
            details of any corrigenda</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The documents are available
    under the following terms and conditions: </font></p>
    <ol>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You should note that The
            Open Group maintains full copyright protection on all
            its publications.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">You are permitted to read
            the HTML and PDF versions of Open Group publications using
            your HTML browser/Acrobat software and to download them for
            your own personal use provided you have given your
            name and email address for each publication
            requested. However, you are NOT permitted to amend,
            copy, reprint, offer for sale, or otherwise re-use
            material from these documents without explicit
            permission from The Open Group. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Whilst The Open Group
            will use its best endeavors to create HTML/PDF versions
            that mirror the hard copy publications, there are
            bound to be differences between the versions. The
            hard copy publication remains the authoritative
            version for Testing and Certification and other purposes.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">The Open Group reserves
            the right to charge for HTML/PDF&nbsp; versions of its
            publications in the future.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2" face="Arial">Readers who acquire the
            HTML/PDF version of The Open Group publications from a
            source other than The Open Group should be conscious
            of the fact that HTML/PDF is a revisable format and that
            the un-official, probably illegal, version they
            acquire might have been changed from the original.</font></li>
    </ol>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">
Additional terms and conditions apply to documents C950, C951, C952
and C953:
