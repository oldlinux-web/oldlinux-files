<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Linux is a Unix-like operating system, which runs on PC-386
computers. It was implemented first as extension to the Minix
operating system <A href="#minix">[Tanenbaum 1987]</a> and its
first versions included support for the Minix filesystem only.
The Minix filesystem contains two serious limitations: block
addresses are stored in 16 bit integers, thus the maximal
filesystem size is restricted to 64 mega bytes, and directories
contain fixed-size entries and the maximal file name is 14
characters.

<p>We have designed and implemented two new filesystems that are
included in the standard Linux kernel. These filesystems,
called ``Extended File System'' (Ext fs) and ``Second Extended
File System'' (Ext2 fs) raise the limitations and add new
features.

<p>In this paper, we describe the history of Linux filesystems. We
briefly introduce the fundamental concepts implemented in Unix
filesystems. We present the implementation of the Virtual File
System layer in Linux and we detail the Second Extended File
System kernel code and user mode tools. Last, we present
performance measurements made on Linux and BSD filesystems and
we conclude with the current status of Ext2fs and the future
directions.

<h3>History of Linux filesystems</h3>

<p>In its very early days, Linux was cross-developed under the
Minix operating system. It was easier to share disks between
the two systems than to design a new filesystem, so Linus
Torvalds decided to implement support for the Minix filesystem
in Linux. The Minix filesystem was an efficient and relatively
bug-free piece of software.

<p>However, the restrictions in the design of the Minix
filesystem were too limiting, so people started thinking and
working on the implementation of new filesystems in Linux.

<p>In order to ease the addition of new filesystems into the
Linux kernel, a Virtual File System (VFS) layer was developed.
The VFS layer was initially written by Chris Provenzano, and
later rewritten by Linus Torvalds before it was integrated into
the Linux kernel.  It is described in <A
href="#section:vfs">The Virtual File System</a>.

<p>After the integration of the VFS in the kernel, a new
filesystem, called the ``Extended File System'' was implemented
in April 1992 and added to Linux 0.96c. This new filesystem
removed the two big Minix limitations: its maximal size was 2
giga bytes and the maximal file name size was 255 characters.
It was an improvement over the Minix filesystem but some
problems were still present in it. There was no support for the
separate access, inode modification, and data modification
timestamps. The filesystem used linked lists to keep track of
free blocks and inodes and this produced bad performances: as
the filesystem was used, the lists became unsorted and the
filesystem became fragmented.

<p>As a response to these problems, two new filesytems were
released in Alpha version in January 1993: the Xia filesystem
and the Second Extended File System. The Xia filesystem was
heavily based on the Minix filesystem kernel code and only
added a few improvements over this filesystem. Basically, it
provided long file names, support for bigger partitions and
support for the three timestamps. On the other hand, Ext2fs was
based on the Extfs code with many reorganizations and many
improvements. It had been designed with evolution in mind and
contained space for future improvements. It will be described
with more details in <A href="#section:ext2fs">The Second
Extended File System</a>

<p>When the two new filesystems were first released, they
provided essentially the same features. Due to its minimal
design, Xia fs was more stable than Ext2fs. As the filesystems
were used more widely, bugs were fixed in Ext2fs and lots of
improvements and new features were integrated. Ext2fs is now
very stable and has become the de-facto standard Linux
filesystem.

<p>This table contains a summary of the features

<h3>Basic File System Concepts</h3>

<p>Every Linux filesystem implements a basic set of common
concepts derivated from the Unix operating system
<A href="#bach">[Bach 1986]</a> files are represented by inodes,
directories are simply files containing a list of entries and
devices can be accessed by requesting I/O on special files.

<h4>Inodes</h4>

<p>Each file is represented by a structure, called an inode.
Each inode contains the description of the file: file type,
access rights, owners, timestamps, size, pointers to data
blocks. The addresses of data blocks allocated to a file are
stored in its inode. When a user requests an I/O operation on
the file, the kernel code converts the current offset to a
block number, uses this number as an index in the block
addresses table and reads or writes the physical block. This
figure represents the structure of an inode:

<IMG SRC="../../../fs/ext2intro-gfx/inode.gif">

<h4>Directories</h4>

<p>Directories are structured in a hierarchical tree. Each
directory can contain files and subdirectories.

<p>Directories are implemented as a special type of files.
Actually, a directory is a file containing a list of entries.
Each entry contains an inode number and a file name. When a
process uses a pathname, the kernel code searchs in the
directories to find the corresponding inode number. After the
name has been converted to an inode number, the inode is loaded
into memory and is used by subsequent requests.

<p>This figure represents a directory:

<IMG SRC="../../../fs/ext2intro-gfx/dir.gif">

<h4>Links</h4>

<p>Unix filesystems implement the concept of link. Several
names can be associated with a inode. The inode contains a
field containing the number associated with the file. Adding a
link simply consists in creating a directory entry, where the
inode number points to the inode, and in incrementing the links
count in the inode. When a link is deleted, i.e. when one uses
the <tt>rm</tt> command to remove a filename, the kernel
decrements the links count and deallocates the inode if this
count becomes zero.

<p>This type of link is called a hard link and can only be used
within a single filesystem: it is impossible to create
cross-filesystem hard links. Moreover, hard links can only
point on files: a directory hard link cannot be created to
prevent the apparition of a cycle in the directory tree.

<p>Another kind of links exists in most Unix filesystems.
Symbolic links are simply files which contain a filename. When
the kernel encounters a symbolic link during a pathname to
inode conversion, it replaces the name of the link by its
contents, i.e. the name of the target file, and restarts the
pathname interpretation. Since a symbolic link does not point
to an inode, it is possible to create cross-filesystems
symbolic links. Symbolic links can point to any type of file,
even on nonexistent files. Symbolic links are very useful
because they don't have the limitations associated to hard
links. However, they use some disk space, allocated for their
inode and their data blocks, and cause an overhead in the
pathname to inode conversion because the kernel has to restart
the name interpretation when it encounters a symbolic link.

<h4>Device special files</h4>

<p>In Unix-like operating systems, devices can be accessed via
special files. A device special file does not use any space on
the filesystem. It is only an access point to the device
driver.

<p>Two types of special files exist: character and block
special files. The former allows I/O operations in character
mode while the later requires data to be written in block mode
via the buffer cache functions. When an I/O request is made on
a special file, it is forwarded to a (pseudo) device driver. A
special file is referenced by a major number, which identifies
the device type, and a minor number, which identifies the unit.

<A name="section:vfs">
<h3>The Virtual File System</h3>
</a>

<h4>Principle</h4>

<p>The Linux kernel contains a Virtual File System layer which
is used during system calls acting on files. The VFS is an
indirection layer which handles the file oriented system calls
and calls the necessary functions in the physical filesystem
code to do the I/O.

<p>This indirection mechanism is frequently used in Unix-like
operating systems to ease the integration and the use of
several filesystem types <A href="#vnodes">[Kleiman 1986,</a> 
<A href="#lfs:unix">Seltzer <i>et al.</i> 1993]</a>.

<p>When a process issues a file oriented system call, the
kernel calls a function contained in the VFS. This function
handles the structure independent manipulations and redirects
the call to a function contained in the physical filesystem
code, which is responsible for handling the structure dependent
operations. Filesystem code uses the buffer cache functions to
request I/O on devices. This scheme is illustrated in this
figure:

<IMG SRC="../../../fs/ext2intro-gfx/vfs.gif">

<h4>The VFS structure</h4>

<p>The VFS defines a set of functions that every filesystem has
to implement. This interface is made up of a set of operations
associated to three kinds of objects: filesystems, inodes, and
open files.

<p>The VFS knows about filesystem types supported in the
kernel. It uses a table defined during the kernel
configuration. Each entry in this table describes a filesystem
type: it contains the name of the filesystem type and a pointer
on a function called during the mount operation. When a
filesystem is to be mounted, the appropriate mount function is
called. This function is responsible for reading the superblock
from the disk, initializing its internal variables, and
returning a mounted filesystem descriptor to the VFS. After the
filesystem is mounted, the VFS functions can use this
descriptor to access the physical filesystem routines.

<p>A mounted filesystem descriptor contains several kinds of
data: informations that are common to every filesystem types,
pointers to functions provided by the physical filesystem
kernel code, and private data maintained by the physical
filesystem code. The function pointers contained in the
filesystem descriptors allow the VFS to access the filesystem
internal routines.

<p>Two other types of descriptors are used by the VFS: an inode descriptor
and an open file descriptor. Each descriptor contains informations related to
files in use and a set of operations provided by the physical filesystem code.
While the inode descriptor contains pointers to functions that can be used to
act on any file (e.g. <tt>create</tt>, <tt>unlink</tt>), the file descriptors
contains pointer to functions which can only act on open files (e.g.
<tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt>).

<h3>The Second Extended File System</h3>
</a>

<h4>Motivations</h4>

<p>The Second Extended File System has been designed and
implemented to fix some problems present in the first Extended
File System. Our goal was to provide a powerful filesystem,
which implements Unix file semantics and offers advanced
features.

<p>Of course, we wanted to Ext2fs to have excellent
performance.  We also wanted to provide a very robust
filesystem in order to reduce the risk of data loss in
intensive use. Last, but not least, Ext2fs had to include
provision for extensions to allow users to benefit from new
features without reformatting their filesystem.

<h4>``Standard'' Ext2fs features</h4>

<p>The Ext2fs supports standard Unix file types: regular files,
directories, device special files and symbolic links.

<p>Ext2fs is able to manage filesystems created on really big
partitions. While the original kernel code restricted the
maximal filesystem size to 2 GB, recent work in the VFS layer
have raised this limit to 4 TB. Thus, it is now possible to use
big disks without the need of creating many partitions.

<p>Ext2fs provides long file names. It uses variable length
directory entries. The maximal file name size is 255
characters. This limit could be extended to 1012 if needed.

<p>Ext2fs reserves some blocks for the super user
(<tt>root</tt>). Normally, 5% of the blocks are reserved. This
allows the administrator to recover easily from situations
where user processes fill up filesystems.

<A name="subsection:ext2fs:adv-feat">
<h4>``Advanced'' Ext2fs features</h4>
</a>

<p>In addition to the standard Unix features, Ext2fs supports
some extensions which are not usually present in Unix
filesystems.

<p>File attributes allow the users to modify the kernel
behavior when acting on a set of files. One can set attributes
on a file or on a directory. In the later case, new files
created in the directory inherit these attributes.

<p>BSD or System V Release 4 semantics can be selected at mount
time. A mount option allows the administrator to choose the
file creation semantics. On a filesystem mounted with BSD
semantics, files are created with the same group id as their
parent directory. System V semantics are a bit more complex: if
a directory has the setgid bit set, new files inherit the group
id of the directory and subdirectories inherit the group id and
the setgid bit; in the other case, files and subdirectories are
created with the primary group id of the calling process.

<p>BSD-like synchronous updates can be used in Ext2fs. A mount
option allows the administrator to request that metadata
(inodes, bitmap blocks, indirect blocks and directory blocks)
be written synchronously on the disk when they are modified.
This can be useful to maintain a strict metadata consistency
but this leads to poor performances. Actually, this feature is
not normally used, since in addition to the performance loss
associated with using synchronous updates of the metadata, it
can cause corruption in the user data which will not be flagged
by the filesystem checker.

<p>Ext2fs allows the administrator to choose the logical block
size when creating the filesystem. Block sizes can typically be
1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes. Using big block sizes can speed up
I/O since fewer I/O requests, and thus fewer disk head seeks,
need to be done to access a file. On the other hand, big blocks
waste more disk space: on the average, the last block allocated
to a file is only half full, so as blocks get bigger, more
space is wasted in the last block of each file. In addition,
most of the advantages of larger block sizes are obtained by
Ext2 filesystem's preallocation techniques (see section
<A href="#subsection:ext2fs:allocation">Performance optimizations</a>.

<p>Ext2fs implements fast symbolic links. A fast symbolic link
does not use any data block on the filesystem. The target name
is not stored in a data block but in the inode itself. This
policy can save some disk space (no data block needs to be
allocated) and speeds up link operations (there is no need to
read a data block when accessing such a link). Of course, the
space available in the inode is limited so not every link can
be implemented as a fast symbolic link. The maximal size of the
target name in a fast symbolic link is 60 characters. We plan
to extend this scheme to small files in the near future.

<p>Ext2fs keeps track of the filesystem state. A special field
in the superblock is used by the kernel code to indicate the
status of the file system. When a filesystem is mounted in
read/write mode, its state is set to ``Not Clean''. When it is
unmounted or remounted in read-only mode, its state is reset to
``Clean''. At boot time, the filesystem checker uses this
information to decide if a filesystem must be checked. The
kernel code also records errors in this field. When an
inconsistency is detected by the kernel code, the filesystem is
marked as ``Erroneous''. The filesystem checker tests this to
force the check of the filesystem regardless of its apparently
clean state.

<p>Always skipping filesystem checks may sometimes be
dangerous, so Ext2fs provides two ways to force checks at
regular intervals. A mount counter is maintained in the
superblock. Each time the filesystem is mounted in read/write
mode, this counter is incremented. When it reaches a maximal
value (also recorded in the superblock), the filesystem checker
forces the check even if the filesystem is ``Clean''. A last
check time and a maximal check interval are also maintained in
the superblock. These two fields allow the administrator to
request periodical checks. When the maximal check interval has
been reached, the checker ignores the filesystem state and
forces a filesystem check.

Ext2fs offers tools to tune the filesystem behavior.
The <tt>tune2fs</tt> program can be used to modify:
<ul>
<li>the error behavior. When an inconsistency is detected by
the kernel code, the filesystem is marked as ``Erroneous'' and
one of the three following actions can be done: continue normal
execution, remount the filesystem in read-only mode to avoid
corrupting the filesystem, make the kernel panic and reboot to
run the filesystem checker.
<li>the maximal mount count.
<li>the maximal check interval.
<li>the number of logical blocks reserved for the super user.
</ul>

<p>Mount options can also be used to change the kernel error behavior.

<p>An attribute allows the users to request secure deletion on
files. When such a file is deleted, random data is written in
the disk blocks previously allocated to the file. This prevents
malicious people from gaining access to the previous content of
the file by using a disk editor.

<p>Last, new types of files inspired from the 4.4 BSD
filesystem have recently been added to Ext2fs. Immutable files
can only be read: nobody can write or delete them. This can be
used to protect sensitive configuration files. Append-only
files can be opened in write mode but data is always appended
at the end of the file. Like immutable files, they cannot be
deleted or renamed. This is especially useful for log files
which can only grow.

<h4>Physical Structure</h4>

<p>The physical structure of Ext2 filesystems has been strongly
influenced by the layout of the BSD filesystem
<A href="#mckusick:ffs">[McKusick <i>et al.</i> 1984]</a>. A
filesystem is made up of block groups. Block groups are
analogous to BSD FFS's cylinder groups. However, block groups
are not tied to the physical layout of the blocks on the disk,
since modern drives tend to be optimized for sequential access
and hide their physical geometry to the operating system.

<p>The physical structure of a filesystem is represented in this
table:
<table border>
<tr>
<td>Boot<br>Sector</td>
<td>Block<br>Group 1</td>
<td>Block<br>Group 2</td>
<td>...<br>...</td>
<td>Block<br>Group N</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Each block group contains a redundant copy of crucial filesystem
control informations (superblock and the filesystem descriptors) and
also contains a part of the filesystem (a block bitmap, an inode
bitmap, a piece of the inode table, and data blocks). The structure of
a block group is represented in this table:
<table border>
<tr>
<td>Super<br>Block</td>
<td>FS<br>descriptors</td>
<td>Block<br>Bitmap</td>
<td>Inode<br>Bitmap</td>
<td>Inode<br>Table</td>
<td>Data<br>Blocks</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Using block groups is a big win in terms of reliability:
since the control structures are replicated in each block
group, it is easy to recover from a filesystem where the
superblock has been corrupted. This structure also helps to get
good performances: by reducing the distance between the inode
table and the data blocks, it is possible to reduce the disk
head seeks during I/O on files.

<p>In Ext2fs, directories are managed as linked lists of
variable length entries. Each entry contains the inode number,
the entry length, the file name and its length. By using
variable length entries, it is possible to implement long file
names without wasting disk space in directories. The structure
of a directory entry is shown in this table:
<table border>
<tr>
<td>inode number</td><td>entry length</td>
<td>name length</td><td>filename</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As an example, The next table represents the structure of a
directory containing three files: <tt>file1</tt>,
<tt>long_file_name</tt>, and <tt>f2</tt>:
<table border>
<tr><td>i1</td><td>16</td><td>05</td><td><tt>file1 </tt></td></tr>
</table>
<table border>
<tr><td>i2</td><td>40</td><td>14</td><td><tt>long_file_name </tt></td></tr>
</table>
<table border>
<tr><td>i3</td><td>12</td><td>02</td><td><tt>f2 </tt></td></tr>
</table>

<A name="subsection:ext2fs:allocation">
<h4>Performance optimizations</h4>
</a>

<p>The Ext2fs kernel code contains many performance
optimizations, which tend to improve I/O speed when reading and
writing files.

<p>Ext2fs takes advantage of the buffer cache management by
performing readaheads: when a block has to be read, the kernel
code requests the I/O on several contiguous blocks. This way,
it tries to ensure that the next block to read will already be
loaded into the buffer cache. Readaheads are normally performed
during sequential reads on files and Ext2fs extends them to
directory reads, either explicit reads (<tt>readdir(2)</tt>
calls) or implicit ones (<tt>namei</tt> kernel directory
lookup).

<p>Ext2fs also contains many allocation optimizations. Block
groups are used to cluster together related inodes and data:
the kernel code always tries to allocate data blocks for a file
in the same group as its inode. This is intended to reduce the
disk head seeks made when the kernel reads an inode and its
data blocks.

<p>When writing data to a file, Ext2fs preallocates up to 8
adjacent blocks when allocating a new block. Preallocation hit
rates are around 75% even on very full filesystems. This
preallocation achieves good write performances under heavy
load. It also allows contiguous blocks to be allocated to
files, thus it speeds up the future sequential reads.

<p>These two allocation optimizations produce a very good locality of:
<ul>
<li>related files through block groups
<li>related blocks through the 8 bits clustering of block allocations.
</ul>

<h3>The Ext2fs library</h3>

<p>To allow user mode programs to manipulate the control
structures of an Ext2 filesystem, the libext2fs library was
developed.  This library provides routines which can be used to
examine and modify the data of an Ext2 filesystem, by accessing
the filesystem directly through the physical device.

<p>The Ext2fs library was designed to allow maximal code reuse
through the use of software abstraction techniques.  For
example, several different iterators are provided.  A program
can simply pass in a function to
<tt>ext2fs_block_interate()</tt>, which will be called for each
block in an inode.  Another iterator function allows an
user-provided function to be called for each file in a
directory.

<p>Many of the Ext2fs utilities (<tt>mke2fs</tt>,
<tt>e2fsck</tt>, <tt>tune2fs</tt>, <tt>dumpe2fs</tt>, and
<tt>debugfs</tt>) use the Ext2fs library.  This greatly
simplifies the maintainance of these utilities, since any
changes to reflect new features in the Ext2 filesystem format
need only be made in one place--in the Ext2fs library.  This
code reuse also results in smaller binaries, since the Ext2fs
library can be built as a shared library image.

<p>Because the interfaces of the Ext2fs library are so abstract
and general, new programs which require direct access to the
Ext2fs filesystem can very easily be written. For example, the
Ext2fs library was used during the port of the 4.4BSD dump and
restore backup utilities. Very few changes were needed to adapt
these tools to Linux: only a few filesystem dependent functions
had to be replaced by calls to the Ext2fs library.

<p>The Ext2fs library provides access to several classes of
operations.  The first class are the filesystem-oriented
operations.  A program can open and close a filesystem, read
and write the bitmaps, and create a new filesystem on the disk.
Functions are also available to manipulate the filesystem's bad
blocks list.

<p>The second class of operations affect directories.  A caller
of the Ext2fs library can create and expand directories, as
well as add and remove directory entries.  Functions are also
provided to both resolve a pathname to an inode number, and to
determine a pathname of an inode given its inode number.

<p>The final class of operations are oriented around inodes.
It is possible to scan the inode table, read and write inodes,
and scan through all of the blocks in an inode.  Allocation and
deallocation routines are also available and allow user mode
programs to allocate and free blocks and inodes.

<h3>The Ext2fs tools</h3>

<p>Powerful management tools have been developed for Ext2fs.
These utilities are used to create, modify, and correct any
inconsistencies in Ext2 filesystems.  The <tt>mke2fs</tt>
program is used to initialize a partition to contain an empty
Ext2 filesystem.

<p>The <tt>tune2fs</tt> program can be used to modify the filesystem
parameters. As explained in section <A href="#subsection:ext2fs:adv-feat">
``Advanced'' Ext2fs features</a>, it can change the error
behavior, the maximal mount count, the maximal check interval,
and the number of logical blocks reserved for the super user.

<p>The most interesting tool is probably the filesystem
checker.  <tt>E2fsck</tt> is intended to repair filesystem
inconsistencies after an unclean shutdown of the system.  The
original version of <tt>e2fsck</tt> was based on Linus
Torvald's fsck program for the Minix filesystem.  However, the
current version of <tt>e2fsck</tt> was rewritten from scratch,
using the Ext2fs library, and is much faster and can correct
more filesystem inconsistencies than the original version.

<p>The <tt>e2fsck</tt> program is designed to run as quickly as
possible.  Since filesystem checkers tend to be disk bound,
this was done by optimizing the algorithms used by
<tt>e2fsck</tt> so that filesystem structures are not
repeatedly accessed from the disk.  In addition, the order in
which inodes and directories are checked are sorted by block
number to reduce the amount of time in disk seeks.  Many of
these ideas were originally explored by
<A href="#bsd:fsck">[Bina and Emrath 1989]</a> although they have
since been further refined by the authors.

<p>In pass 1, <tt>e2fsck</tt> iterates over all of the inodes
in the filesystem and performs checks over each inode as an
unconnected object in the filesystem.  That is, these checks do
not require any cross-checks to other filesystem objects.
Examples of such checks include making sure the file mode is
legal, and that all of the blocks in the inode are valid block
numbers.  During pass 1, bitmaps indicating which blocks and
inodes are in use are compiled.

<p>If <tt>e2fsck</tt> notices data blocks which are claimed by
more than one inode, it invokes passes 1B through 1D to resolve
these conflicts, either by cloning the shared blocks so that
each inode has its own copy of the shared block, or by
deallocating one or more of the inodes.

<p>Pass 1 takes the longest time to execute, since all of the
inodes have to be read into memory and checked.  To reduce the
I/O time necessary in future passes, critical filesystem
information is cached in memory.  The most important example of
this technique is the location on disk of all of the directory
blocks on the filesystem.  This obviates the need to re-read
the directory inodes structures during pass 2 to obtain this
information.

<p>Pass 2 checks directories as unconnected objects.  Since
directory entries do not span disk blocks, each directory block
can be checked individually without reference to other
directory blocks.  This allows <tt>e2fsck</tt> to sort all of
the directory blocks by block number, and check directory
blocks in ascending order, thus decreasing disk seek time. The
directory blocks are checked to make sure that the directory
entries are valid, and contain references to inode numbers
which are in use (as determined by pass 1).

<p>For the first directory block in each directory inode, the
`.' and `..' entries are checked to make sure they exist, and
that the inode number for the `.' entry matches the current
directory.  (The inode number for the `..' entry is not checked
until pass 3.)

<p>Pass 2 also caches information concerning the parent
directory in which each directory is linked.  (If a directory
is referenced by more than one directory, the second reference
of the directory is treated as an illegal hard link, and it is
removed).

<p>It is noteworthy to note that at the end of pass 2, nearly
all of the disk I/O which <tt>e2fsck</tt> needs to perform is
complete.  Information required by passes 3, 4 and 5 are cached
in memory; hence, the remaining passes of <tt>e2fsck</tt> are
largely CPU bound, and take less than 5-10% of the total
running time of <tt>e2fsck</tt>.

<p>In pass 3, the directory connectivity is checked.
<tt>E2fsck</tt> traces the path of each directory back to the
root, using information that was cached during pass 2.  At this
time, the `..' entry for each directory is also checked to make
sure it is valid.  Any directories which can not be traced back
to the root are linked to the <tt>/lost+found</tt> directory.

<p>In pass 4, <tt>e2fsck</tt> checks the reference counts for
all inodes, by iterating over all the inodes and comparing the
link counts (which were cached in pass 1) against internal
counters computed during passes 2 and 3.  Any undeleted files
with a zero link count is also linked to the
<tt>/lost+found</tt> directory during this pass.

<p>Finally, in pass 5, <tt>e2fsck</tt> checks the validity of
the filesystem summary information.  It compares the block and
inode bitmaps which were constructed during the previous passes
against the actual bitmaps on the filesystem, and corrects the
on-disk copies if necessary.

<p>The filesystem debugger is another useful tool.
<tt>Debugfs</tt> is a powerful program which can be used to
examine and change the state of a filesystem. Basically, it
provides an interactive interface to the Ext2fs library:
commands typed by the user are translated into calls to the
library routines.

<p><tt>Debugfs</tt> can be used to examine the internal
structures of a filesystem, manually repair a corrupted
filesystem, or create test cases for <tt>e2fsck</tt>.
Unfortunately, this program can be dangerous if it is used by
people who do not know what they are doing; it is very easy to
destroy a filesystem with this tool.  For this reason,
<tt>debugfs</tt> opens filesytems for read-only access by
default.  The user must explicitly specify the <tt>-w</tt> flag
in order to use <tt>debugfs</tt> to open a filesystem for
read/wite access.

<h3>Performance Measurements</h3>

<h4>Description of the benchmarks</h4>

<p>We have run benchmarks to measure filesystem performances.
Benchmarks have been made on a middle-end PC, based on a
i486DX2 processor, using 16 MB of memory and two 420 MB IDE
disks. The tests were run on Ext2 fs and Xia fs (Linux 1.1.62)
and on the BSD Fast filesystem in asynchronous and synchronous
mode (FreeBSD 2.0 Alpha--based on the 4.4BSD Lite
distribution).

<p>We have run two different benchmarks. The Bonnie benchmark
tests I/O speed on a big file--the file size was set to 60 MB
during the tests. It writes data to the file using character
based I/O, rewrites the contents of the whole file, writes data
using block based I/O, reads the file using character I/O and
block I/O, and seeks into the file. The Andrew Benchmark was
developed at Carneggie Mellon University and has been used at
the University of Berkeley to benchmark BSD FFS and LFS. It
runs in five phases: it creates a directory hierarchy, makes a
copy of the data, recursively examine the status of every file,
examine every byte of every file, and compile several of the
files.

<h4>Results of the Bonnie benchmark</h4>

<p>The results of the Bonnie benchmark are presented in this
table:
<table border>
<tr><th></th><th>Char Write<br>(KB/s)</th>
<th>Block Write<br>(KB/s)</th>
<th>Rewrite<br>(KB/s)</th>
<th>Char Read<br>(KB/s)</th>
<th>Block Read<br>(KB/s)</th></tr>
<tr><td>BSD Async</td><td align="right">710</td><td align="right">684</td><td align="right">401</td><td align="right">721</td><td align="right">888</td></tr>
<tr><td>BSD Sync</td><td align="right">699</td><td align="right">677</td><td align="right">400</td><td align="right">710</td><td align="right">878</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ext2 fs</td><td align="right">452</td><td align="right">1237</td><td align="right">536</td><td align="right">397</td><td align="right">1033</td></tr>
<tr><td>Xia fs</td><td align="right">440</td><td align="right">704</td><td align="right">380</td><td align="right">366</td><td align="right">895</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The results are very good in block oriented I/O: Ext2 fs
outperforms other filesystems. This is clearly a benefit of the
optimizations included in the allocation routines. Writes are
fast because data is written in cluster mode. Reads are fast
because contiguous blocks have been allocated to the file. Thus
there is no head seek between two reads and the readahead
optimizations can be fully used.

<p>On the other hand, performance is better in the FreeBSD
operating system in character oriented I/O. This is probably
due to the fact that FreeBSD and Linux do not use the same
stdio routines in their respective C libraries. It seems that
FreeBSD has a more optimized character I/O library and its
performance is better.

<p>The results of the two first passes show that Linux benefits
from its asynchronous metadata I/O. In passes 1 and 2,
directories and files are created and BSD synchronously writes
inodes and directory entries. There is an anomaly, though: even
in asynchronous mode, the performance under BSD is poor. We
suspect that the asynchronous support under FreeBSD is not
fully implemented.

<p>In pass 3, the Linux and BSD times are very similar. This is
a big progress against the same benchmark run six months ago.
While BSD used to outperform Linux by a factor of 3 in this
test, the addition of a file name cache in the VFS has fixed
this performance problem.

<p>In passes 4 and 5, Linux is faster than FreeBSD mainly
because it uses an unified buffer cache management. The buffer
cache space can grow when needed and use more memory than the
one in FreeBSD, which uses a fixed size buffer cache.
Comparison of the Ext2fs and Xiafs results shows that the
optimizations included in Ext2fs are really useful: the
performance gain between Ext2fs and Xiafs is around 5-10%.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The Second Extended File System is probably the most widely
used filesystem in the Linux community. It provides standard
Unix file semantics and advanced features. Moreover, thanks to
the optimizations included in the kernel code, it is robust and
offers excellent performance.

<p>Since Ext2fs has been designed with evolution in mind, it
contains hooks that can be used to add new features. Some
people are working on extensions to the current filesystem:
access control lists conforming to the Posix semantics
<A href="#posix6">[IEEE 1992]</a>, undelete, and on-the-fly
file compression.

<p>Ext2fs was first developed and integrated in the Linux
kernel and is now actively being ported to other operating
systems. An Ext2fs server running on top of the GNU Hurd has
been implemented. People are also working on an Ext2fs port in
the LITES server, running on top of the Mach microkernel
<A href="#mach:foundation">[Accetta <i>et al.</i> 1986]</a>, and
in the VSTa operating system. Last, but not least, Ext2fs is an
important part of the Masix operating system
<A href="#masix:osf">[Card <i>et al.</i> 1993]</a>,
currently under development by one of the authors.

<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>The Ext2fs kernel code and tools have been written mostly by
the authors of this paper. Some other people have also
contributed to the development of Ext2fs either by suggesting
new features or by sending patches. We want to thank these
contributors for their help.
