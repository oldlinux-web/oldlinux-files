OK, I've switched from TAMU to SLS (1.0, .99pl6-26), and I have some big
time problems that I need solutions for. I HOPE someone out there can help me.

1.      I am a victim of these random logout/process kills. Is there a
        solution?

2.      Can someone give me straight-forward instructions for upgrading
        to the latest version?

3.      I can't get getty/uucico to work, nore news in general. It
        appears that uugetty and uucico don't lock each other out
        properly.

        It took me quite a lot of playing around eith inittab and modem
        settings to get it partially working. -clocal causes any process
        to HANG on the modem port if CD is not enabled for one. This
        might be fine if getty was the ONLY process, but bi-directional
        modem usage is hampered.

        I have heard that there is a new scheme in Linux, where /dev/cul
        devices are used? Is the the "approved" method? How do I get
        this update?

4.      There is no cron anywhere. How does one set up a crontab for use?
        I can't schedule uucp and news stuff without a cron, can I?

5.      uucico obeys time restrictions, even if -S is used.

6.      There seems to be no method of establishing mail forwarding
        (i.e. mail -F xxx type stuff). How does one do this?

7.      When uucico finishes a call on a news feed, all the batch
        files vanish and I end up with a core file. I assume it was
        uuxqt that died, but I have no real idea what's going on.

9.      How can I change the "sync" interval?

10.     LILO no longer builds an interactive loader for selection partitions.
        How do I do this now?

11.     man getty (uugetty?) does not describe the -r switch. I know
        what it does (in fact, it ws necessary for me to use it), but
        it's missing from man.

12.     Does nntp work?


My BIGGEST problems are getting bi-directional uucp/uucico working
(and still allowing shell logins on the same port), and getting news
functional. I know how to configure the stuff - it's just not working.


Thanks!

OK, I was able to upgrade and rebuild by system, and am now running pl7a.
I still have some problems/questions I really could use help with.

1.      I created the /cua devices (with valid protection and ownerships),
        but any attempt to use the cua1 device (my serial port) results
        in a "device is inuse" error. How does one get around this, and
        how does this "solve" my uucp/uucico bi-directional modem
        problem. The /dev/ttys1 seems to work as expected.

2.      I created a 512k ram disk when I rebuilt and do get a message
        about it on bootup. How does one mount and use it though?
        I tried to create a file system on it, but got a superblock error.

3.      Any attempt to use the selection program results now in an IOCTL
        error. This USE to work -- how do I fix it?

4.      Is there ANY way to limit X windows to the vc that starts it?
        It's TERRIBLE that you lose your vc's when X is running. How
        about limiting XDM to a single vc?

5.      I STILL can't build an interactive loader program. The version
        of LILO I have only builds a loader that boots the first
        partition in your config file and doesn't know verbs like
        "prompt" and "message".

        Franks Xia loader builds, but won't boot my linux partition
        (hangs). I read somewhere about building a secondary loader in
        a reserved area. If I need to do this, how do I do it when I
        already have a system? I was fortunate enough to build my system
        with a root using e2fs, but I took default answers (except for
        file system size n blocks obviously). Can I build a secondary
        loader without harming my existing system?


Thanks!!!

The minor device number on /dev/ram as created by the SLS install is incorrect.
It should be minor device 1, not 0.

Reply-To: barrett@pamsrc.enet.dec.com
Date: Tue, 13 Apr 1993 17:09:32 GMT


I'm running .99pl6 (SLS 1.0), with an updated getty_ps package and call-out
devices for proper bi-directional modem usage. The modem is a 14.4 device,
connected at 9600 baud with no compression or error correction. The serial
tty is set to 38400 in gettydefs.

Everything pretty much runs smoothly, except that during every connection to my
news feed for a news download, I get a "header checksum" error and
"got packet xxx; expecting packet yyy" errors about 2 minutes into the call
(after a few compressed files have been received). This eventually hangs up
the phone.

I recently switched to this 486/Linux setup from my old SVR4 Bnews setup.
I never had a problem using the EXACT same configuration, sites, phone, and
modem - so I do not believe it's a real noise/phone/communication error.

Anyone have any ideas what could be going wrong, or what I should do to
fix this? Anyone else seeing this? Perhaps there's a problem in uucp
"getting back to the phone fast enough" when it creates/renames the temp file
into real files?

I'm experiencing the random logout problem, and heard that I need to upgrade
my sharable libraries to eliminate it.

I'm currently running .99pl6, GCC version 2.3.3

As I look around, I see Linux GCC releases and updates marked 2.11, 4.2, 4.3,
4.3.2, and 4.3.3

The various readme files are not clear as to which versions are in fact the
current releases. I'm also not sure which ones will work with my current
system images and kernel version.

Could someone give me some details as to what-is-what here, and what the best
upgrade path for me to take is? I can no longer just "wipe" out my system
and start over (too much has changed), so I have to deal with component
upgrades.

I want to get this right, because as you know a wrongly-done sharable
library upgrade will hose the system.


Thanks in advance

I tried to upgrade the kernel from .99pl6 to .99pl7

It pretty much worked, except for the following:

        1. I could no longer shutdown the system. shutdown, halt, etc would
           all simply display the shutdown message, but then just sit there.

           I can't use this kernel until I solve this -- anyone know what's

The Linux C library is named as x.y.z where x is the major release number, y
is the minor release number and z is the patch level. The shared library is
backward compatible. That is the new release of the Linux C library, x1.y1.z1,
will be compatible with x.y.z iff x1 == x and ((y1 >= y) or (y1 == y and
z1 >= z)). So 4.3.3 is the latest release and compatible with 4.2, 4.3 and 4.3.2, but not 2.11.

You should read the release notes for the compatible kernel versions. For
4.3.3, you should use 0.99.5 or above.

===================

This is a great idea, and now is a chance for some brave soul to do it
right, rather than using one of those strange DOS-based compression
schemes.   :-)

I am aware that some *real* standardization work is being done as we
chat (sorry, don't know where).  I heard ISO and/or ANSI was involved.

A standards body is dealing with the possibility of having intelligent
compression take place for magneto-optical read/write disks.  The idea
is to do as you suggest in your post ....  place a marker in the inode
to indicate the file is compressed.  That way, you can have both types
of files concurrently in the same filesystem.

An interesting offshoot of this is the use of a compression chip right
in the disk controller.  The chip is smart enough to recognize inode
structures as the data is read from the disk.  If it sees the compression
marker, it de-compresses the data in the file *in_hardware* and clears
the compression marker before the inode data is passed to the CPU.

If the same disk cartridge is mounted in a non-smart disk drive, the
kernel code for the filesystem gets the inode structure unmodified, and
does decompression in software instead.  Furthermore, if your filesystem
code can't decompress a file written by another, you can simply 'cat'
the file through a standard decompressor command to recover the data.

Neat idea!   The important thing here is that the *file* data is com-
pressed, *not* the inode data.   This is quite unlike the DOS schemes.

Such an ISO/ANSI filesystem is also portable by design, since filesystems
created on any computer can be mounted by any other compliant system.

If someone is tempted to try this, I'd like to suggest that now would
be a good time to investigate any possible emerging standards *before*
creating the filesystem code.  Since Linux is headed in the POSIX
direction, keeping up with the standards would be a good thing.

My $0.02 worth, anyway.

Chuck.

        This is what the bootable rootdisk is for.  I have yet to see a good
argument for why the bootable rootdisk cannot be used instead of specially
staticly linked binaries to fix screwups with the sharable libraries.

I, too, just upgraded from 8 megs to 16 megs and have the same exact
motherboard as yours.  The only thing different is that I have a 33
Mhz Intel chip & 128K cache.  I'm also experiencing some problems with
my Linux workstation (ver. 0.99pl7).  :)  If we do have the same
motherboard, it's definitely not EISA.

I'm have a different problem though.  I'm using 'mke2fs' version alpha
0.2b which came with SLS 0.99pl6 package.  It worked perfectly before
the memory upgrade.  I dropped back down to 8 megs of memory and
reconfigured the kernel for supporting > 16 megs memory.  After
creating the kernel, I then powered the machine down and upgraded the
machine to 16 megs.  For a couple of days, my machine was working
fine, but now it is slowly eating away my ext2 partition.  I keep
getting 'inode already cleared...'  Lots of the files have permission
bits set to '?---------'.  /usr/bin/less is one of the dead files.  I
understand that there is a new ext2fs 0.2c & 0.99pl8?  I'm hoping that
I have enough binaries to build a new kernel & re-compile ext2fs...

I also had problems with 'rm'.  It seemed to hang the shell (bash)
when I typed 'rm -rf' on a temporary directory.  I tried killing the
'rm' process also, but no luck.  The only way out is a 'sync;reboot'
on a a different virtual console.

I also added a Toshiba 3101(?) SCSI CD-ROM.  I took this off a PS/2
system that had some IBM proprietary SCSI interface.  I just pulled
out that card and now is a standard SCSI CD-ROM.  Does anyone have a
drive like this?  Does it work with the current port of xcdplayer?  I
just want to play my music on it.  Linux does recognize that it is a
CD-ROM, however.  I've verified that there is no SCSI address conflict
because my system worked with the CD-ROM under 8 megs of ram, but 16
megs gives my hard disk some problem.

Any help/suggestion(s) greatly appreciated.  Linus?

BTW, my $0.01 worth:  I've shrunk my DOS partition down to 40 megs
(for games).  Almost gone!  Heck, I haven't played games in a while,
maybe I just get rid of DOS completely... 8)

The interface builder I have found that I really like is SUIT:
Simple User Interface Toolkit.

Its very easy to learn and produces motif-looking widgets.

It is available on sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/linux/X11/devel, called suit.tar.Z.

The original (non-linuxed) distribution is available at uvacs.cs.virginia.edu.

Another thing I like about this package is that there are versions for DOS

I've heard about another interface builder that runs in a kind of shell-interpreted

bugs are fixed in that version.  But it handles '8dd4..' perfectly :) If your

changed in order to get the search/replace and ignorecase stuff to work with
1.24.  It appeared on alt.sources (articles 7084-7099 at wuarchive.wustl.edu
/usenet/alt.sources/articles).

I must say that this is the best VI clone that I've ever seen.  It has 1 or 2
annoying things (doing a !!  just puts you on the : line with x,x!  as the
command :( But overall it is faithful to the editing features, and improves
(optionally) the features that I really wanted improved.  But the most
important thing is COMMAND LINE RETRIEVAL AND EDITING!  :) I use it as the
default vi for my RS/6000, Linux and MessyDOS.  Check it out.

Subject: LILO-0.10 Hangs
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 03:46:51 GMT

I am running linux 0.99.8 and attempted to installed LILO 0.10  Everything 
appeared to work flawlessly during the installation -- no error messages or 
any other signs of trouble.  However, when I attempted to boot from my 
harddrive, lilo got only as far as printing "LI" then appeared to hang.  
I installed lilo with only the default /Image using QuickInst with all the 
preset defaults (nothing fancy ...)  Note:  lilo-0.9 worked fine for me.
Any ideas?

Since I am already posting, I have another question.  I cannot log in as 
root from my first virtual console.  The log in procedure appears to work 
fine up to the point where the shell is started, then it hangs.  All other 
consoles (2 ... 8) work fine and I can still access them after the first 
console hangs.  Ordinary users can log in fine from the first console, but 
if they log out, and then attempt to log back in, they have the same 
problems as root.  (Things appear to hang sometime near when the shell is 
started.)  Note, this problem disappears when I boot linux-0.99.8 from a 
floppy disk.

Thanks for any help.

           Yes.  Build them yourself.  Not intended to be a flame
           but all these sources are freely available, easily
           compilable, easily statically linkable, easily installable
           any way you please.

           Its YOUR system to do with as you see fit -- try it, you'll like it.

I'm certainly going to find the GNU file utilities and make
statically linked versions of things like cat and ln.

My recommendation was that binary distributions of Linux, such as
the SLS, ought to have a minimal set of statically linked
utilities so that a problem with the shared libraries won't make
the system completely unusable or unfixable.  It is very
frustrating to find that one weak link and then discover that you
can't fix it without something like a bootable rootdisk because
the tool you needed to fix it broke along with everything else.
The one simple way out of my problem immediately became
inaccessible to me; it also seemed impossible to do anything like
rename or copy one of the necessary files (although the trick
with using "while read x; do; echo $x; done < file" in place of
cat is a trick I hadn't thought of).

Unfortunately the SLS does not come with source for the GNU file
utilities so most SLS users without net access will find your
solution impractical.

This isn't a flame, either.  I've used UNIX systems for a long
time and am used to a certain amount of arcana and just having to
know things in order to keep the system going.  My recommendation
for a core set of statically linked utilities is intended in the
spirit of making Linux easier to deal with for people without the
resources or the knowledge that you or I have.

Until there's some agreement on what core utilities ought to be
statically linked, though, I highly recommend that new Linux
users keep copies of the a1/a2 SLS disks around or get HJ Lu's
bootable rootdisk, which will allow you to recover from a variety
of problems including mangling your shared libraries.

Yes. I've succeeded, except that I have a ADI dmc-2304 SVGA

No, you shouldn't. 

An horror story about my LILO installation follows. I have two IDE
drives on my system. 

I just installed LILO for the first time and I screwed up almost
everything with boot sectors and MBRs I could.  My first drive
(entire drive is in one primary dos partition) wasn't recognized,
so I had to do FDISK /MBR several times.  Then, my dos partition
didn't boot and I had to retransfer the system onto it.  At last
my dos drive were ok again and I read the README once again (I
didn't have the paperdoc available yet).  I checked everything
once again and got LILO to boot up linux.  But it refused to
install dos at all, so I checked my linux drive with fdisk and it
reported that my root partition's physical and logical start
points differ.  I had to backup my root and mkfs to it and
restore the files.  Lucky me at this point because I had just day
before downloaded HLu's bootable rootdisk (before that I had only
SLS-0.98.5 a1 and a2 disks to bootup from floppy!).

In the beginning of re-making my root partition (its size is
16MB) I had there about 3800KB free space.  After restoring files
back to fresh partition I had only about 1300KB free space!  So,
I remembered a utility called "makehole" and played with it quite
a lot and free space increased dramatically, to about 3700KB.
Then it was sleeping time.  In the morning I woke up and found my
system crashed due to problems with root partition's minix-fs.  I
had to boot from floppy and do fsck onto it a few times (three or
four times, so that it didn't complain anymore).  Then I checked
free space once again and got really surprised.  There were -- and
still is -- about 6300KB free space!  

Now I don't know if I should be worried about that since
everything works fine so far...

Date: Tue, 13 Apr 1993 21:02:55 GMT

Hi,
on sunsite.unc.edu I found a binary version of xdtm-2.5 (X Desktop Manager) 
for Linux. Great program! Unfortunately, it doesn't run properly on my Linux
box. At least the following problems I've noticed:
 - After calling the file information dialog I get an error message on the
   xterm that launched xdtm:
   "xdtm: Internal Error, permissions dialog not free'd"
   Sometimes xdtm crashes after this and dumps core.
 - Double clicking an executable file doesn't execute it, but calls the
   file information dialog.
 - 'set ignore' in .xdtmrc has no effect.
 - The long listing mode doesn't work at all. The short listing mode works, but
   needs an additional 'goto' command to show the directory listing. 
My attempts to compile the xdtm-2.5 sources failed so far. Although there are
the binaries on sunsite, I couldn't find any patches for Linux provided.

Any help to fix these problems is greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance.

Subject: gcc -traditional and memcpy
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 05:32:19 GMT

I haven't seen this mentioned in the FAQ.  Please excuse me if it's
old territory.

I'm running 0.99.7a of the kernel and a fairly recent SLS distribution
with gcc 2.3.3 and libc-4.3.3.  While trying to make rpcgen, snavtched
from wuarchive (why? I had this paranoid vision of losing part of the
source for mount and needing to rebuild the various modules from
mount.x by hand), I noticed that compiling a program referencing
memcpy or memcmp with the -traditional switch yields the following
error messages:

# gcc -O -traditional test.c
In file included from test.c:1:
/usr/include/string.h:38: warning: conflicting types for built-in function `memcpy'
/usr/include/string.h:38: warning: type mismatch with previous external decl
<built-in>:0: warning: previous external decl of `memcpy'
/usr/include/string.h:63: warning: conflicting types for built-in function `memcmp'
/usr/include/string.h:63: warning: type mismatch with previous external decl
<built-in>:0: warning: previous external decl of `memcmp'

Since experimentation on Ultrix and SunOS systems didn't produce the
same problem, I poked around a little in the Linux include files and
found the inlined functions for memcmp, memcpy, and the various string
functions in include/linux/string.h under the Linux source directory.

I presume that what's happening is that the GNU include files in
/usr/include provide prototypes that clash with the ones defined in
the kernel.  Granted, the example above demonstrates only warning
messages that don't impede the linking of a working executable, but
(a) it would be nice to eliminate the warnings if possible, and (b)
it's simply never a good idea to let incompatibilities like this
linger, for they may come back to haunt you when you can least deal
with it.

Might it be a good idea to fiddle with the GNU-supplied include files
so that they jibe with the kernel prototypes?  Or, for that matter,
should the kernel prototypes be changed to work with the GNU include
files?

Is it just me, or does less (version 1.77, SLS-supplied) not accept
regular expressions in searches under Linux?  It certainly doesn't
behave this way in general.  (Yes, I can rebuild it, once I spend a
half-hour or so downloading the source over a 9600-bps link, but it
seems peculiar that it wouldn't work in the SLS distribution).

I had just posted wondering about demand-paging, but came up with an
idea. Have it uncompress the file, and put it on some temporarily
allocated inodes, and exec/demand page it from there. It would require
some changing of filesystem allocation/exec/demand paging routines I

I hope selection becomes part of the kernel before the kernel is called

It sounds like a useful idea for those pressed on diskspace, and seems
worth implementing. Some problems that need to be addressed:

1. Speed of access.
2. Demand-paging. It'll probably be really hard to get this to work with it.
3. Backwards compatibility. Anyone out there know if there are any spare
fields or bits (seems like this idea only needs to steal one) in the
inode structure of the current filesystems?
4. How to have the kernel actually decompress? Exec an outside program?
(Hard to do, much kernel internals hacking, memory foo to deal with)
Work with a daemon? (What do you do if the daemon dies, etc? How does
the daemon start, and talk to the kernel?) Build gunzip into the kernel?
(Might be difficult, but then, the kernel does decompress itself, so
maybe we can steal that code.....)

This does seem a lot better than trying to compress the whole FS (not
quite as efficient for space, but probably a hell of a lot easier to
implement).

Anyway, good luck with this idea. It has been mentioned before, but this
time there is some proposed way of handling some of the implementation
details; it seems quite feasible. I don't know enough about filesystems
to know how easy/hard this will be tho...

about paging and random update:

it seems to me that the solution is simple.  don't compress the file,
compress on the block level.  You KNOW that when uncompressing a block how
big it will be.  You have to read in the whole block anyways the issue of how
big it is on disk is orthogonal to everything else.  prepend the block with
a byte identifying what compression alg (if any was used) and all is taken 
care of.  I'm currently working on implementing exactly this on a lfs.  In
this case, a number of different compression algorithms are used and the one
with the best compression (including no compression) wins.  the only real 
change to the surrounding lfs code was that the head position had to be
byte indexed rather than block indexed. no biggie.

Yoho,

I tried to boot the a1 disk from the SLS packages on a Compaq Deskpro with
an ADAPTEC 1542A and a Conner 200MB Harddisk. The Kernel unpacks, checks
for and finds my disk correctly, but then goes into an indefinite loop,
trying to reset the controller and failing.
Has anybody ever had the same problem and if so, what is the solution ?
(Other than: get yourself another controller, coz I can't)

I don't like the seagull idea however. Seagulls are too common I think...

Hi there,
just thought I'd post a few offerings after I found
while installing the latest SLS 1.0

1. the c proggy to test if the mouse is working
   (can't remember where it is)
   is missing the line
   #inlude <signal.h>

2. The file xinitrc has a line
   OPENWINHOME=/u/........
   which should read
   OPENWINHOME=/usr/..........

3. to get some of the man/cat pages to work in X you need to create
   two links. geqn -> neqn  and  gtbl -> tbl.

4. A few C proggys that compiled before, did not this time.
   The problem was the /usr/include/linux directory was a
   a true directory with a few files in it and not a link
   to /usr/src/linux/include/linux  (I think that's right)
   I just moved the files in /usr/include/linux, deleted
   the dir and created the link, and all compiled fine then.
   I needed to do this for a kernel recompile as well.

Apart from that it was a breeze.
One thing though. X now takes a LOT longer to start up, then the
previous SLS did. I'm using a Trident 8900C card :(
(the scrolling is painful).

Thanks again.

        Sorry to bother all of you with this but I couldn't find an answer 
in the FAQ.  I currently have the SLS distribution of linux on my hard
drive and am ready to install!  Now I know I'm supposed to rawrite A1 and
A2 to their respective floppies.  What I was wondering is whether the
installation can be switched to the B: drive after the initial boot.  The
reason I'm asking is because I despise 5 1/4 floppies and would like to
install the rest of linux from the B: drive (3 1/2).  Is this possible?
Also I've been told that X windows is a beast if you only have 4 megs of
RAM.  I'm looking to get 4 more megs but I'm kinda broke right now.  How
much of a beast is X at 4 megs...:) Thanks!

   This is what the bootable rootdisk is for.  I have yet to see
   a good argument for why the bootable rootdisk cannot be used
   instead of specially staticly linked binaries to fix screwups
   with the sharable libraries.

A good argument: If you trash the shared libraries you can't even
run sync!  If you use a bootable rootdisk you have to shut the
system down, but you risk filesystem damage because you couldn't
sync first.  shutdown or halt won't work with the shared
libraries gone either.

Ideally, if you haven't panicked the kernel then you really
shouldn't have to reboot the machine.  Something simple like
mashing the shared library links doesn't destroy the system to
the point of unusability _except_ that absolutely nothing will
run, including the commands you could have used to get things
going again without a reboot.  If only I had thought of using a
while/read/echo loop in one of the shells I still had running to
copy libc.so.4.3.3 over the top of libc.so.4 . . .

Perhaps I am harping on this point too much, since I have now
recovered from my mistake and I managed to sleep off the
incredible fit of anger I experienced when I discovered that I
had made it.  I am simply recommending that the basic set of
Linux utilities have a few critical statically linked members
(like 'ln'), so that some common mistakes can be recovered from
more quickly and conveniently.

Hello again everyone. For those that have been following the thread, I am the
same person who posted the bit about "Crashing machine with more than 16 megs
of memory" patch applied and all. I have gotten several replies and tried many
things and thought that those of you following the thread would appreciate an
update. Actually, I also think I should add a couple things I realized I left
out in my first post.

Oh, first the things I left out. I have been testing this under 0.99p8 (though
I also had made it crash under p6 and p7). Also, the memory itself is all the
same speed (80ns) so it's not possible that it could be a speed problem.
(Though I would be skeptical of that as a problem in the first place. Someone
explained to me that if you mix speeds it all just runs at the speed of the
highest in the mix, which makes sense from an architectural standpoint.)

As for the updates. Someone suggested that maybe it was a bad SIMM. I didn't
want to admit this as a possibility at first (it was easier to blame Linux :) )
so I cracked open the machine and ran a battery of tests. It all came up
negative. In the end I just SWITCHED the 4 SIMMS that have been working as my
16 megs for the past month with the other 4, and have been running fine with
them for days now. So, even though it would have been an easier solution to
the problem, it looks like my memory is fine.

Also someone pointed out to me that machines with a small cache and lots of
memory tend to run really slow. This explains a lot to me. I have just a 386/25
with a 64k cache, and I noticed that when I upgraded from 8 megs to 16 megs
that it spent less time swapping (of course) but it seemed to be running much
slower when doing normal work with the memory. So obviously this is linked to
the size of my cache. In other words, even if I COULD get all 32 megs to work,
with a 64k cache it's likely that it would be slower than I was at 8 megs with
swapping!

Nevertheless, these answers don't explain why it broke when I applied the patch
and tried to use all the memory. As another helpful soul pointed out, the patch
is amazingly simple and is only in place to watch out for things like the cache
problem. I guess the patch can't be blamed then. What is left? The motherboard?
Any other PD 386 owners try to go to 32 megs?

Does anyone have any clue as to what is wrong:
System:
        386DX40 UMC Chipset, AMI Bios
        IDE HD, 4S, 2P
        Generic WD clone network card.
        Linux 0.99pl8; upgraded from SLS Linux pl 4 disk A,B,C,X

Problem:
Telneting to another machine works initially, but after a short while,
it just hangs. I can ^[ back to my linux machine and 'c'lose the connection.
However, the connection does not close on the remote end. FTP also
hangs randomly. Telneting remotely to my linux machine also hangs randomly.
I tried using NCSA Telnet in MS-DOS and it works fine, so I am assuming it is
not a hardware problem. 

Any ideas as to what may be wrong or what I need to get?  Email if possible.
I'll summerize if there's any interest. If any relevant information is
missing, please let me know

Thanks.

1st: you wont get 14.4k times 4 through put! I never have and never will
        the best you can expect from V42/bis is 2 times.. or 28K for
        text only..

2nd: I have used the system at 14.4k - and dont forgot a lot of file,
        transfers are compressed - and u will get about 11-12k using
        Zmodem and the CPU use on a 386/40MHZ was approx 20-30%
        and i cant tell ya wat the load averages were.. coz
        i cant remember.
        This was using a normal (16450 nonfifo) serial card with
        an extrenal modem.

i dont know about internals.. they are probably better because they
are direct hardware and the bytes of data go direct to
the modem hardware.  *shrug*

Hi, there,


My friend installed the Linux 0.99 recently. He got the whole SLS package from
tsx-11 and installed about 1 weeks ago. But he has the problem on the SCSI
cd-rom. When he started the machine, Linux told him "0 host, 0 scsi, 0cd-rom"

I guess the problem is the interface. The interface is Future Domain TMC-850
(8 BIT) card. I once had read about to change the seagate.c in line about
548-550 to ...=...|80;. And I rebuild the kernel, but it still not work.

Any suggestion is appreciated, any idea?

To get people to read your post and answer your question:

- Read "Linux Documents Explained for Newbies" - posted weekly (see below).
- Please do not post questions answered in the FAQ lists.
- Please do not post "Please send me the FAQ". See below.
- Please do not post "Split this group now". See below.

- Please read the documentation for the program you have a problem with.
- Be informative, both in subject line and body. See below.

- Linux-specific posts only please - Unix, X, C, etc. groups listed below.

For more information read on ...

*** Linux Documents Explained for Newbies (like me 8-) *** is is posted weekly
by Jay MacDonald. If you can't find it email me or Jay <jay-m@equinox.unr.edu>.

It will tell you about the Linux FAQ, the INFO-SHEET, the META-FAQ, etc.  These
are posted regularly to comp.os.linux and c.o.l.announce, and can be found in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/linux-faq at pit-manager.mit.edu and on the Linux
archive sites. If you can't get them there, try mailing
"mailserver@nic.funet.fi", "mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu" or
"ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com". If you can't get them any other way, e-mail me.

Splitting the group (due to volume or other reasons): It's been tried, and all
the new groups except .announce failed. It can't be tried again within 6
months.  See news.announce.newgroups.  If you insist on discussing it, do it in
news.groups (if c.o.l has too much volume already, why make it worse?).

With threaded newsreaders now in widespread use using a good, specific, polite
subject line will get you many more readers. Most people will ignore posts with
subjects like "Linux", "Help", "SLS", etc. Don't shout to get attention.

Put as much information in your post as possible - preferably a brief summary
followed by session transcripts, etc. as appropriate. Include the precise text
of any error messages printed, etc., and appropriate info about your setup.

Linux is a Unix clone running on PCs; X has its own groups. One of the
following groups is is quite likely to be more appropriate for your question:
 Unix:   comp.unix.questions,  .admin,  .programmer,  .shell   etc.
 X:      comp.windows.x,  comp.windows.x.i386unix (for XFree86 etc)

Yes, Binkley is up and running since october last year. What I want
to release now is an updated version with a number of bug fixes.
The new version will also compile on BSD systems. Ben Stuyts 
ported Binkley to the Next, I used his port to get something 
working for Linux. The new version is coordinated between us, so it
will compile under (at least) the Next and Linux.

Currently both Rfmail and Binkley use their own nodelists. I will 
try to update Rfmail to use the Binkley (version 6) nodelist.

Rfmail also includes a mailer (very simple) but I never used it.
Rfmail is primarily intended as a fido <-> news/mail gateway so 
it requires news, (s)mail, a mail interface (e.g. Elm) and a newsreader.
It does work quite well at the moment, even though a lot of fido people
would like to see native fido compatible programs a setup with Rfmail `
works for me.

Sure you can "see" it :

# echo *

Will happily list all the files in your cwd.

Bare minimum is your shell, 'cat' and 'mv' IMHO.  'ln' would be nice,
but not absolutely neccessary, You can always make a COPY temporarily,
and then link back correctly later.

I suggest to have a bootdisk/rootdisk handy and _sync_ as statically linked
binary. I think it's better to maintain a good list of utilities / files
on a root disk then to discuss some static linking. The reason
is that static linking doesn't help anyway if you make typing errors
and delete something valuable. 

Some old Unix hackers might use 'echo *' instead of ls. But I would not
get such an idea. This is the reason, because I tell everybody to
use a good bootdisk, where you find everything you need.

I've made a recovery disk as a rootdisk for my 5.25 '' drive. It contains
no kernel and I could put _everything_ on this disk I need to
install linux. (tar, gzip, rdev, ln, mkdir, dd, beav ...) 
And there is enough place left for zcat, less and faq.z :-)

Couldn't future version of linux binarys be compiled to first search for

Hi,

With all this talk about new features for the various filesystems, I figure
no-one's really mentioned anything about Disk Quotas. 

Ok - it's fine if you're a just using Linux as a single user machine, but if
you have a whole load of users hanging out of it, you really _do_ need some
form of mechanism for making sure that people don't hog the machine.

Is there a chance of seeing code for them being written in the (near)
future?

I had the same problem. My solution was to install the sendmail+ida package.
Now I have simple /bin/mail and /bin/rmail as transport agents, elm as a
frontend and sendmail as the "router". There were only few things to change
in the sources. I don't remeber exactly, but the most important thing was to
change the header format of elm. The "from" line must be the first one and
the "subject" line the last.

I would be interested too in this feature. Is somebody out there working
on a BSD or a log file system (like the one implemented at berkeley) ?

These filesystems are commonly implemented together with quotas.

This is not specific to less/vi. Try useing elm, and starting emacs,

As far as I am aware, this is actually a problem with bash. Bash is a
little silly about intercepting signals in the background, and so it
exits, so less/elm think that vi/emacs has exited, and so it starts

As yet, I haven't managed to find a patch for bash that will fix the

Hi folks,

I tried to access a Kodak Photo-CD with my Toshiba XM3401 SCSI CD-ROM.
But there's no chance to read the files because Linux can't mount the
CD-ROM. The Filesystem is unknown to it. 
Reading "normal" CD-ROMS doen't make any problems at all.

Does anybody know about this problem? Who can help?

Subject: Does _anyone_ use a WD-7000FASST with Linux?
Date: 14 Apr 1993 07:12:13 -0500


A while ago, my brother posted for me about a problem I'm having getting my
WD-7000FASST SCSI controller to work under Linux.  At this point, the only
replies I've seen in e-mail were from other people who have the same sort
of problems, asking to get copies of any help I get.  

I don't know about any of the other people, but I bought this card 
specifically because it was listed as a compatable controller in the 
hardware FAQ.  I'm very bummed; here I sit with a nice system full of 
supposedly compatible hardware just BEGGING to have Linux installed, 
and I can't get past booting A1.

Does ANYONE have a WD-700FASST controller functioning PROPERLY under
Linux?  If so, what is the ROM release on the card?  What kind of 
hard disk are you using?  What SCSI ID is assigned to the disk?
I had all sorts of trouble with the controller when I had the disk 
as SCSI ID 0, but when I moved it to ID1 it works fine under DOS;
maybe the SCSI ID has something to do with it.

I'm dying to bring up Linux, but until one of my SCSI controllers
is properly handled by the OS, I'm SOL (My other SCSI is an IN-2000;
it's looking like that may be supported soon, which would be GREAT).

Please, if you're using a WD-7000FASST card with Linux, I need to 
hear from YOU.

Pet Peeve #2: Linux thinks my digiboard is on IRQ4, when it's 
configured at IRQ3.  Of course since I can't get Linux installed,
I can't really address this problem just yet...

or PPP support so I'd be interested in hearing whats out there for BSD
or Linux in that area (ie which has the better support?)

So if Brandon could post a summary of the Email he gets on this I'd
appreciate it (I'm sure there are a couple of other people out there
that are at least *mildy* interested as well).

Subject: Basic info on LINUX.
Date: Tue, 13 Apr 93 23:29:37 PDT

        Can anybody out there answer a few elementary questions on LINUX?
I am familiar with the general concept of the system but I have quite a 
few simple questions. Here goes:

- What are the minimun hardware requirements for decent operation? ( I 
  have a 386DX40, 4megs and 120megs )

- Recommended hard disk space?

- Can Linux run DOS apps? To what extent?

- Is cohabitation of DOS on the same HD simple or a headache?

- What level of technical knowledge is required to install it?

- Where can I find information text files via ftp? (I'm looking for basic 
  info, not a whole manual)

I would greatly appreciate any type of answers, I want to escape the 
Gates of hell!

Please respond via email if possible at phil@pixie.login.qc.ca

Philippe.

Reply-To: davidsen@crd.ge.com (bill davidsen)

  I have the Apr 5 SLS installed and have finally hacked the tcp stuff a
bit and gotten it going on my system. The problem I'm seeing is that:
  1) telnet works fine
  2) ping works fine
  3) NFS works fine
  4) ftp works only for small file (<100k) and is slow (<30k cps)

  Is there some parameter I have to set to get this working, or is this
a known limitation of the current tcp, or what? Any clues would be
useful, I have more time in this already than I can afford.

  Note, all my changes were in the area of card detection, in wd.c. I
did a bit of work to insure that the probe didn't run off singing "I
found it" when it hadn't, and didn't use the transfer address in EEROM.
The logic was changed not at all, I just have some stuff in the system
which could look like a net card.

I wanted to say:
Some motherboards may be unable to make a different timing for the EISA-Slots with

Reply-To: frampton@vicuna.ocunix.on.ca

Hello!

First of all, I wish to express my gratitude to all who responded to my 
queries.  My mailbox has been literally overflowing with answers.  The 
response was so overwhelming I must apologize for not being able to 
personally thank each of you via private e-mail.

My question was simple:  After removing Linux from my hard drive, and 
formatting my drive, I was quite surprised to see LILO still prompting me 
to enter the boot partition.  I wanted to know how I could get rid of 
that boot message and use the standard DOS one instead.

Using 'FDISK /MBR', the master boot record on the hard drive will be 
replaced with one specific to DOS.  No data is lost whatsoever.

Surprisingly, a number of you did not believe 'Enter boot partition 
(1-4)' was a LILO prompt.  I am using TAMU Linux .99p4 and perhaps LILO 
has been patched with this revision to make it easier on the user, but 
yes, this is definitely a LILO (or at least a Linux) message.

Thanks again!

Well, I have thought about these disk quotas for sometime now.  One of these
days, I will actually sit down an implement them.  Here is what I think is 
involved:

1) The filesystems must all be modified to handle quotas... Essentially,
     at least the "writing of files" mechanism must be modified to check 
     for reached quotas before going through with the right.  Also, many
     popular quota systems also start setting file sizes to 0 when any 
     file is a) opened b) over quota c) used up time period or warnings.
     So, the "opening of files" mechanism may also need to be modified.

2) There must be a way for quotas to be maintained.  I think BSD's approach
     is to include a quota field in the password structure, or something
     like that (I am not sure, though).  Most systems keep track of a file
     called "quotas" which would determine the quotas of every user on the
     system.

3) Some library calls may need to be modified to handle quotas.  At the
     minimum, every library call that has to do with writing of files, 
     must at least check for quota violations.  I figure that a new errno
     would be created, something like ERRQUOTA or something like that.
     (There is probably a standard for it.)

I am sure there are others, but this is good enough for now.  I don't think
a quota daemon (i.e. quotad? :-) ) would be good enough, since it is very
hard to detect when a file is going to exceed a quota and stop that write
*before* it happens.

2 concepts of most quota systems:
  1) Soft Quota -> If you exceed this quota, then the writes will succeed,
        but you will be given a time period (i.e. 1 week) or a number of
        login warnings (i.e. 3 logins) before the quota system will take
        action.  Taking action usually means that any file that is written
        to, and sometimes, any file that is read, will have its filesize
        effectively changed to 0.  This would continue until the user
        removes enough files to go under the quota, or the quota system
        changes enough files to reduce the quota for the user...

  2) Hard Quota -> This one is set higher than the soft quota, and is the
        absolute highest amount of disk space the user can use at any time.
        If the hard quota is reached, whatever write was going on at the 
        time is halted and the file closed.  So, in most cases, the user
        will be left with a file that is incomplete, but uses up the rest
        of the hard quota.

I don't think quotas will be that hard to implement.  I am concerned, 
however, how to handle any modifications to the libraries, such as libc
and any of the gnu libraries.  HLU?  Can you give us any ideas on this?
Is it necessary?

The "proper" way to do a compressed filesystem is in fact not a compressed
*filesystem* at all, it's a compressed *disk*.  Which means that individual
blocks are compressed regardless of contents.  Since *ix does updates on
entire blocks in all (current) cases, this imposes only a decompression speed
penalty on demand paging.

Of course, it *does* make it rather difficult to put an FFS on a compressed
drive, since you need to sandwich an uncompress/recompress operation around
fragment updates....

Subject: Possible gotcha in gcc
Reply-To: davidsen@crd.ge.com (bill davidsen)
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 13:01:10 GMT

  I noted an interesting behavior in gcc last night, it doesn't ignore
stuff which is #ifdef'd out! I got a program to port to Linux, and I had
some text included which I found valuable. Having learned long ago that
putting /*...*/ around arbitrary stuff might be a problem due to */ in
the text, I put #if 0 ... #endif around it instead. A gcc generated
error messages about the text it should have been ignoring!

  Obviously the preprocessor has to scan for #commands, but it shouldn't
be complaining about other things in the text, like over-long strings,
etc. This *may* be an enhancement of the Linux version, since the
V.4/386 and Sun versions of gcc don't complain about the problem.
Therefore I want to check it carefully before I report it to the
developers as a generic bug in gcc.

  Just a warning to jiggle your memory if you ever have something
similar happen.

I made the same, miserable experience. I tried to repartition the hd.
As i realized later, i made a fault by setting the unit size in fdisk to <sectors>
and created partitions, that didn't start and end on cylinder boundaries. I never recognized
this error, because (older) fdisk gave no warnings and i had ext fs running stable
for 4 months. When i now changed to ext2 fs, mke2fs didn't correctly allocate
my 32 MB root partition. While there had been ~8MB left on that fs (output from df 
and e2fsck), write accesses had 'no space left on device' as result. Beside that,
i did get these 'bad directory entry errors' from time to time
When i tried to mount that fs from the rootdisk (from tsx-11:/pub/linux/GCC/rootdisk)
i got a similar error as you described. When i ran fdisk from that rootdisk,
i got many warnings about physical and logical sectors not beeing the same.
So i had to delete all the old partitions and started a new installation. I'm not done
now, but i didn't have any problems creating my ext2 filesystems.

  Sounds like a non-problem to me, I've occasionally whacked the Linux
partition so hard it wouldn't boot, and I've always been able to fix it
from the A1/A2 SLS disks.

  No, buy the serial port and modem. Each can be used for other things,
you can use the modem with your next computer (might not be a PC) or
upgrade the modem without changing the box. I hear that ISDN is big in

On a related note - has anybody done/or is planning to try and get
Xfree to support other accelerators?

I would like to get a linux machine soon (in a couple of months), but
don't want to be limited to having to buy an S3 accelerator when there
are other cards out there claiming (don't know if this is true or not)
to be faster for similar price.

I use SUN systems at the mo, which have a variety of accelerators
(/dev/cg[two|three|six|etc...]) I suppose if you wanted to develop
Xfree for some other chip set we'd have to agree on a device driver to
start with.

If, when I get a system and there was still nothing done on a card I
bought I'd be willing to have a bash at this, but how much info, help,
etc. is there about, and how long do you reckon it would take (this
bit mainly aimed at whoever wrote XS3)?

Just a couply of thoughts,

Rob.

Subject: NEW FILESYSTEM IDEA!

I've just started using Linux, and I think it's way cool.  I've been
using Stacker for a couple of years now, and I want to write a version
for Linux.  All you need to do is put gzip into xiafs.

PS.  Has anyone done a version of SmartDrive for Linux?
----

I suppose it's seen as a good idea because it's standard in DOS 6.
However, I can't think of many compelling reasons why such a thing is
needed in unix, let alone the unix kernel.  Uncompressing files on the
fly mucks lots of assumptions in the basic workings of the filesystem
and vm system, and prevents things from happening that are a bigger win
in the long term.  It seems to me that a cron job that finds long-unused
files (most of them) and compresses them would be more useful.  The tcx
(?) system is example of this idea.  Frequently used files shouldn't
be compressed, its not so hard to decompress files that are only used
every now and then.

Some kernel support would be nice, but not by putting gunzip into /Image.

This is like something I'm currently working on.  I've written a
filesystem which is essentially a stub which communicates with a user
process through a pair of file descriptors attached to pipes or sockets.
It allows the user process to either completely synthesize a filesystem
at the mountpoint, or generate it from another source.

Apart from filesystem prototyping, the kind of applications I can see
for it are a compressing filesystem (which I can't see as being very
useful) or an encrypting one.  Other ideas are a /u filesystem that is
just appears with a symlink for each user, pointing to their home dirs
(a good way of not needing ~ expansion that works for everything),
an ftp filesystem (tho Alex has preempted that) or mounting tar files.

The nice thing is that the kernel remains small (userfs makes the
kernel less than 10k bigger), but offers a facility which has unlimited
flexibility.  Yes, this is a project influenced by Plan 9 :-).

Currently its incomplete, but it might be ready for alpha testing in
a few weeks.

Dear Netters,

        Now I come accross another problem while installing the SLS package.
Here is my partition table:
==========================================================================
Disk /dev/hda: 8heads, 39 sectors, 761 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 312 * 512 bytes

Device     Boot  Begin  Start  End  Blocks  ID  System

/dev/hda3          730    730  761   4992   82  Linux swap
==========================================================================

        Boot by a1, I have done the following commands with no error messages:

# mkswap /dev/hda3 4992
# swapon /dev/hda3
# mke2fs /dev/hda2 36816

        But now when I started to run "doinstall /dev/hda2" , the following
messages appeared when installing the a3 disk:


MINIX-fsmagic mathc failed
[MS-DOS FS Rel.alpha.8, FAT 16, check=n, conv=b, uid=0, gid=0, umask=000]

ts=1963212550]
Unsupported FS Parameters

Insert disk a3 into the floppy drive then hit enter, q to quit


       Then after I pressed "enter", the same message appeared. I tried 3 times
and was quite sure that the installation failed when the below appeared:


mv:can not move `/root/fstab.tmp' to `/root/etc/fstab':No such file or directory


       I also tried another way: to install with the LILO a1.test disk. I did
the same procedure as above, and went quite fine before  the " doinstall
/dev/hda2 " command. This time the following message appeared when installing
a2 disk:

mount: mount point /root doesn't exist.
Error: Can not mount /dev/hda2. Did you use: mkfs /dev/hda2 SIZE
where SIZE is the number of blocks shown by fdisk?

        But I did have done "mke2fs /dev/hda2 36816" already... Can anyone
help me with this problem? Thanks very much...


Sincerely

  Depends on the interrupt rate. On a 386DX-40 Linux seems to live with
400-600 int/sec without dropping (serial data). But the UART has a FIFO
so the required response is something like 6ms (12 bytes at 19200).
Linux will run faster, but the int rate generally doesn't get higher,
the FIFO gets deeper.

  If your hardware will fill a buffer or something, I'm sire you can
make it work. If you can come in via serial port, that will work. If you
need better latency than 2ms you may have to limit what you do on the
machine to reach that level.

  If you write an IEEE-488 driver for Linux I know someone who would
like to know about it (maybe 9000 systems worth).

I didn't find any direct info on this question, so I "dare" posting
it: quite often when I try to compile software on linux there are
files for lex or yacc. Usually I think it's a good thing to have
scanners and parsers generated automagically, but I seem never to be
able to use files written for lex with flex. (Yes, I DO change the
library to -lfl!) There are always quite some undefined symbols.
Mostly I get this straightened out by pushing the file through lex on
a Sparc2 and the hand-editing it so it goes along with libfl. But that
certainly can't be the way to go. Could someone push me back on right
path, please! How do I do it the right way??

Thanks for any advice,
Hank.

Reply-To: hank@Blimp.automat.uni-essen.de

There seems to be something wrong in the NFS-code in 0.99-p8. Today I
got the new kernel and also the new nfs-server. I tried all
combinations, so I know the following problem is caused by the new
kernel, NOT the new nfs-server (nfs-server 1.5 with the p7-kernel
works). So here is the problem:

My /usr/spool/mail is a sym-link via a mount-point to another machine
(also linux), where all mail is sent to. This works fine. Just with
the new kernel elm can't open /usr/spool/mail/username for reading
anymore. The user can look at the file using more, can edit it with
emacs, can receive mail, just elm won't work.

I tracked it down to probably being a group permission problem in the
nfs-code. Users belonging who have an additional *group* membership of
root can read their mail, others cannot.

For now I rebooted using the old kernel. But I guess one should
lighten this up a bit. (Yes, IF I should find time I'll have a look
myself, to help all those great people out their dedicating their time
to Linux.)

Hank.

  A related question, the V.4 (ufs) filesystem doesn't by default
reserve a lot of room for root only. The 10% reserve to prevent
quadradic behavior (slowdown) and fragmentation is not there. Neither
are the slowdown or fragmentation. And you get 32 bit inodes, so you
don't run out of inodes all the time.

  Sure would be nice to have this functionality on Linux.

You should have the emulate 3 button set in your Xconfig and then you should

Currently, I installed Linux 0.99p6 and I couldn't run X because
my Logitech S9 BusMouse functions weird.  Now, I set it to IRQ 5.
No matter how I move the mouse, the cursor just move to the lower left

doesn't recognize the screen resolution.  I use 1024x768 ET4000

Only if you've managed to get the tape patches to install in your new

OK, I took the plunge and upgraded my X to 1.2 (via SLS).  I was running with
a 832x600 at 36 just fine.  I put in the EXACT same information in the Xconfig
and when I ctl-alt-+ over to that setting the screen is all out of sync and
messy.  My setup is as follows: Samsung Multi-sync monitor with a Diamond
Speedstar Plus.  With the previous version of X this set up worked just fine
(no problem with the clock).  I am now wondering if I am being bitten by the
Diamond bug and need to do something else to make my set up work (like run
something called freq???)?  I have made the Xconfig for this new version have
as much of the same information as the previous version to try to reduce any
errors.  I can't provide the speeds for monitor and card as they are at home.
If it helps I purchased the monitor in '88 and the card in 90(maybe early 91).
I have been thru the FAQ's and will be going thru the modegen tonight.  But,
I played with modegen before, thats how I came up with the 832x600 setting.
So, if modegen hasn't changed for this new version, it will probably be a 
futile effort.  Any other help?

Subject: Has anyone run Minix 1.5 in the DOS emulator?
Date: 14 Apr 1993 15:47:20 GMT

Due to an end-of-semester project in my operating systems class, I need to run
Minix 1.5 on my PC.  Rather than having to reboot whenever I need to work on 
it, I thought it would be really cool to run it in the DOS emulator.  The
problem is that even the universal boot diskette (which only uses BIOS calls to
access the HW) won't boot in dosemu 0.48; I suspect that all the BIOS calls 
that Minix wants aren't there.

Has anyone successfully done this?  I don't have a lot of time right now to 
hack dosemu (whatever Linux hacking time I have I intend to spend on the Ultra-
Stor 14F/34F driver), but if anyone has any "fast & easy" tips, I would really
appreciate it!

Look, I understand the FSF position regarding Apple, *but* I am still playing
around with porting Linux to the Mac platform along with other motivated people
(much more motivated than I am, as a matter of fact :-).

The point is, there are a lot of folks out there with Macs.  They are not
encouraging facist computing, nor are they a member of Apple's "Evil Empire"
and wander around with a Borg-like mentality--"My user interface will 
assimilate you, resistance is futile".  They merely bought a nifty, well 
built machine that fills their needs, why punish them?  Shoot, most of 'em
don't even *know* about the FSF or GNU or any boycotts!

The last thing I need to hear is, "Ohhh, you're doing a *bad* thing,
you'd better stop it".  I don't consider a Mac port wrong in any way shape or
form.  Besides, if the FSF doesn't like Apple's legal tactics regarding their 
user interface, what would be better than giving everybody a viable alternative
to that Mac OS that Apple is so protective of?

Ironically, the biggest stumbling blocks have been the lack of *useable* FSF or 
GNU tools to get the job started in the correct spirit--free tools used to 
develop a free OS.  Actually, there *is* quite a lot of GNU stuff ported to 
the Mac, my only beef is that gcc needs the MPW to run under.  Irregardless, I
think I've solved that problem and I'm charging on.

I want to learn, I want to do something worthwhile and give a little back to
the computing community that has helped me so much, and I think this is a good
way of achieving these aims. . .

By the way, this is *not* an announcement of *anything*!  I'm just starting
out, I don't expect anything anytime soon--Heck I don't know how far I'll get or
if I or others will even come close to such a beast in this decade!!!

So much code, so little free time :-)

I have warned you in c.o.l. Please dig out my old article. I may miss
something here.

1. Get Rick Sladkey's mount 0.99.6. It is in mount-0.99.6.tar.Z and
   utile-1.4.src.tar.z from sunsite or tsx-11.
2. Remove any
        rdev > /dev/mtab
   from /etc/rc.
3. List / partition in /etc/fstab.
4. Add "mount -av" in /etc/rc or somewhere like that.
5. Always provide a fs name in /etc/fstab.

After rebooting, you will be fine.

the mode you have to specify in the 'Xconfig' file in /usr/lib/X11. OK. He ownes the

machine:        486DX33 with 16MB ram and 256kb cache

Has anyone of you the correct modes for this monitor, yes we tried to calculate them
but it wouldn't work.


If you have any positive answers to my questions, please e-mail to: grobi@uni-paderborn.de because I don't read this special newsgroup very often.

I am new to Linux and am trying to install it to my system and experienced some problems.

I have the following hardware spec.

        486DX - 33MHz
        8M RAM
        Seagate ST3238A IDE 245M hard drive (solely for Linux)

        1.44M floppy drive
        SVGA display

When I put disk a1 into the floppy and reboot, the system reads it without any problem until it comes to the part where the user has to key in drive that installation is done from.  Below is the message that appear on the display:

=============
.....
4) Drive B, 5.25in

Further instructions can be found in the file /user/README.
Type 'more /user/README' to look at it.

I tried to list the directory but no files or directories are found.

I have also look at the latest posting of FAQ that suggested using 'rdev' to correct to problem, but the file can not be found.

Can anyone tell me what is wrong and what should I do.

Thanks in advance for any hint.

You'll see a performance hit if you do it that way (byte indexes)...  I would
arrange for logical blocks (probably 4K) to be stored in any of several
physical block sizes, from 1K to 4K (e.g. uncompressed).  (I'd include 512
bytes but this is problematic when the kernel only supports 1K blocks.)

Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 16:21:44 GMT

Hi!

I am trying to use xgdbbin (0.99 pl4) with no luck.  I made the correct
compiler switch (-g) and I started the debugger with 
     xgdbbin -exec=program -symbol=program &
The debugger started and loaded the code into the top window.  However,
when I click on run or if I try to type in the lower window I get the
following error:
     [ioctl TIOCSPGRP failed in terminal_inferior: Not a typewriter]
Do you recognize this error and can you make a suggestion as to how
I might solve it?

If this posting should not be in comp.os.linux which conference should it
be a part of?

Thanks,

Sort of like the Plan 9 interface for file (or anything else) servers.

It would be neat to have something like the bind() call from Plan 9
that would let you attach a process to a particular file.  All
filesystem calls to that file would be get directed to that process.
I guess streams might be another way to achieve the same thing.  At
the very least this would allow user level testing of filesystem
code, and would allow one to develop a transparent networked
filesystem with little effort (in fact, whether the filesystem is
accessed from over the network or not becomes totally irrelevant).

Extensions from filesystems are also obvious.  This would be a way to
get access to any device.  To take an example from one of the the Plan
9 papers, you could implement a line printer daemon that mimics a
filesystem.  Creating a file in that directory is the same as sending
it to the printer queue.  rm removes it from the queue.  ls -t prints
out the queue in the order files will be printed, etc.

Something like this would also let you establish specific access
methods for specific files.  For example, if you are worried about
security and the encrypted passwords in /etc/passwd, you could bind a
process before that file.  Any program now reading that file will get
the passwd records it expects, but with the passwd field stripped out.
Only properly authorized programs would be allowed to see the real
record.  This would allow you to enforce an update policy for a
database file, for example, by routing everything through a single
server, and not have to rely on advisory locking.

Well, it is in ALPHA testing. That means you take your own chances. I
just had my msdos and root partitions bleed into each other. I'm not
sure if it was the new lilo (0.10) or the ext2fs or a combination of
the two. The point is if you use stuff in ALPHA testing, you have to

I think it's the 'access()' bug that was uncovered by the pl8 NFS code. 
It's not actually a NFS bug, but some silly coding in the sys_access()
routine in linux/fs/open.c - the following short and simple patch should
fix it.  The patch is also part of the ALPHA-diffs I made for the msdos
people due to the vm86 signal problem..

As you can see, it's just a 'iput()' call that is made too early: it
works on the other filesystem types due to the inode caching, but under
NFS this breaks..

Yes, it most certainly is.  Although this does bring up the question of
configuration...

With a NE2000 card, a multi-port serial, a sound-card, a QIC-36 tape
controller and the like, it sure would be nice to have configurable
IRQs, port addresses, etc available without multi-kernal remakes.

Has anyone else done any thinking about this?

As of Xfree86-1.2 I moved from maintaining XS3 to adding support for S3
cards in Xfree86, The S3 support will not make it into the next release of
xfree86 (be it either 1.2.1 or 1.3), but will definetly be there in 2.0.
Don't ask me when v.2.0 will arrive, but it won't be this or next month.
There are plenty of bugs and performance problems to be ironed out yet.

Support for mach8, ibm8514, and probably cirrus are in the makings. This

Nobody said it *couldn't* be used... but a strategic statically-linked binary
could be used to fix things more quickly and without a reboot.  If you want to
repair things *without* blowing off that program that's been churning in the
background for an hour, you want tools that are installed on the running
system.

And while pdksh is certainly smaller than bash, rc is smaller yet... and the
bootable rootdisk is already squeezed for space.

In any case, I didn't say -- or intend --- that all those suggestions should
actually be followed; I was just commenting on the individual suggestions
themselves.  Personally, I have the bootable rootdisk because I don't really
*have* any big background churners on my system (yet :-)

The thing is, that if they have a MAC and they don't know about the FSF/GNU then they won't want a CLI, they won't want Un*x. So I agree that porting Linux to the MAC would
be in violation of the FSF recomendation/guideline/rule/whatever.

BUT, having said that, I do believe that the FREE OS / FREE Software thing from GNU
will have to be clarified....

Subject: keyboard w/o X-Windows (German_latin1)
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 93 16:06:48 GMT

Having recompiled the kernel the German_latin1 keyboard which
I personally prefer worked quite well.

Even though there are some changes which I made and which might
be a suggestion to others.

1. Control-keys:  keyboard.c does them by pressing control+ the
combination to the corresponding key.  This differs from what is
common for German keyboards:

ctrl-"u (not ctrl-altgr-8)  ^[
ctrl-+  (not ctrl-altgr-9)  ^]
ctrl-#  (not ctrl-altgr-"s) ^\
ctrl-2  (not ctrl-altgr-Q)  ^@
ctrl-6  (not ctrl-^)        ^^
ctrl-_  (that's the same)   ^_

Those who do not know the German keyboard can still get the idea.
It seems to be necessary to have a control-map for each keyboard-type.

2. altgr-keys: Some characters (like {[]}@~|) can only be accessed
with altgr+something (7890q+<). That is ugly for some of them, because
it requires holding the right hand in a strange way.  Try, if you
don't know.  The keyboard driver of DOS 3.2 had the additional way to
access these characters by ctrl-alt-+something which works much better
for most of them.

3. numlock and shift:  traditionally one could get the digits with
shift, if numlock was off and the arrows with shift if numlock was
on.  That still makes sense to me.

4. esc-Sequences for arrow-keys and function-keys: There seem to be
many esc-sequences for encoding the arrow-keys and things like insert,
page-up, page-down, etc.  Some look like \e[x (x is a letter), some
like \eOx (x letter), some like \e[n~ (n number) and some like \e[nz
(n number).  I got an idea which sequences have which meaning but I do
not know, when the different encoding methods are changed.  The
\eO-stuff is used in cursor set mode and application mode, the
\e[-stuff otherwise.  But the switching to these modes seems to depend
on the machine...

The \eOx and \e[x-stuff is easier to use for programs so I would tend
to prefer it as much as possible.  There are sequences of this type
for page-up, page-down, PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4.  Why not map F1...F4 to
the PF1...PF4?  Also the well defined numpad number encoding
\eOp..\eOy could be used for the ctrl-numpad-key-combinations and
ctrl-arrow-key-combinations.

This would make it possible (and makes it possible for me) to use
these keys heavily for editing with a configurable editor (like emacs
is).

So I discribed my personal preferences.  I would be interested if
the suggestions which I made are shared or if there are other suggestions.
In that case it might be useful to ask the author of keyboard.c for
some enhancements or to supply them.

I want to thank the author of keyboard.c for having written a useful
and lucid program which could easily be understood and changed.

Anyone interested in implementing a threads library
might want to have a look at POSIX 1003.4 Draft 9, which include 
asynchronous i/o and application threads (aread(), aio(), etc.).

(no, I don't have it, and no, I'm not working on a threads library)

well, here's one person (who was recently new to Linux...not to UNIX, but
new to Linux) who disagrees with you.  I've gotten nothing but good help
from this group, and all from people who were quite ready to help however
they could.  this trend has continued even up to this morning---I have
more than a few e-mail messages that came in during last night's UUCP poll
regarding some stuff I'd asked about recently.

sure, it's a high-volume newsgroup.  but that's due to the fact that
there is an awful lot of stuff going on here.  there's nothing that
says you have to read every single article, though.  :-)

>In an effort to help these people I am willing to host a 'Linux newbie
>mailing list' where there aren't any 'what not to post here' or 'read this

first off, ignore the ``what not to post here'' post that appeared a while
back.  it appeared to be either a badly-timed April fool's joke or someone
on a power trip.  it certainly wasn't intended to be taken seriously.

as for the ``READ THIS BEFORE POSTING'' post, I've talked (via e-mail, of
course) to the guy who posts this, and it is definitely not intended to
intimidate anyone (I'd originally made this mistake, too, btw, when it was
worded a bit differently).  it's intended to give you pointers to where
you can find certain info faster and easier than you would if you posted
here.  if you haven't looked at it recently, take a look---he's revised
the wording now to where it doesn't lend itself so easily to this type of
mis-interpretation.

>Do you think this is a good idea? a bad idea? Let me know. If I get

personally, I think it's a bad idea.  c.o.l isn't hostile toward new
Linux users....if it was, there wouldn't be any new Linux users.  like I
said earlier, I've gotten a lot of great help here.  also, if all the
new folk leave here, they're in a pretty good position to miss out on a
lot of stuff they might be very interested in, if they knew about it.

I'd originally heard that c.o.l was hostile toward new folk, but this
has turned out to be nothing but pure BS...quite the opposite is, in
fact, the case.

if anything, people just need to pay attention to how they post their
question.  I see lots of subject lines with things like ``I NEED HELP''
or ``PLEASE READ THIS'' that, of course, nobody ever reads.  then, I see
people who, instead of calmly describing a problem and asking for help, go
straight to being hostile and say this or that sucks because they couldn't
install it....this, of course, is going to make a lot of people get hostile
with them (they asked for it, they got it).

If they don't know about FSF or GNU it is because they *have* been
'assimilated' by the Macintrash empire.  If they were dumb enough to
buy an over-priced-one-mouse-button-tiny-black-and-white-screen-

in the first place, there's really no reason for them to want or need
UNIX.  After all, purchasing a Macintrash is acceptance of its point
and drool interface, AND a token of acceptance for Apple's business
practices-- both of which go against the free software/UNIX tradition.

Not at all.  The best way would be to chuck that Mac out the window

Well I have _already had three emails about this so I'll reply to my own
post to save /usr filling :->

The people who emailed me pointed out that gzip is a darn site more
effective at compression than compress is. I can see the importance of
this when Gnu rely so much on the net for distribution.

What I meant was using a 'proprietory' (although that term doesn't apply
to copylefted stuff very well) compression system is dangerously like the
sort of thing that Microsoft would do IMHO. At the time of posting I
didn't realise that gzip was a better program anyway, so I shall retract
my earlier statement.

Hmm - the biggest problem I can see here is that filesystems can be
pretty dynamic things.  For instance, how would a centralised security
server cope with maintaining consistency across remote (NFS)
filesystems, and how would it cope with dynamicly mounted filesystems
or filesystems with removeable media?

It may be a good idea to have a security service daemon, for example,
but this would have to be done in such a way that the security
database could be distributed over the various filesystems so that the
security information for any filesystem is kept on that filesystem.

Indeed - the ext2fs has inodes reserved to hold an ACL database, and
has reserved space within each inode for file and directory indexes
into the ACL database.  However, there is as yet not even any proposal
as to the precise form these will take - they are currently just
placeholders, there to ensure that an ACL extension in the future will
be compatibile with existing ext2fs filesystems.

If your commands still work then there is probably little need to
upgrade.  Binary compatibility is as much a function of the system
shared libraries as it is of the kernel - kernel upgrades go to great
lengths not to break existing code, but rather to fix bugs and to
provide extra functionality.

You can use the "ldd" command (part of the Linux binary utilities in
the GCC directory on tsx-11.mit.edu) to find out which libraries an
application depends on.  The current main library is now
libc.so.4.3.3, available in the same GCC directory; by following the
instructions in the release note you should be able to upgrade from
any libc.so.4.x without changing your binaries.  You might however
want to replace any programs that depend on libc older than
libc.so.4.0, or on X libraries older than libX11.so.3.0.

Between them, sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu hold pretty much all
of the significant Linux binaries and source.

Only partially.  There is no support for quotas (although there are
patches around which add quota support to older kernels).  ulimit is
partially supported; currently, only the core-size limit is respected,
and (for ext2fs filesystems only) the file-size limit.

The easiest way to use these is to use the builtin ulimit command of
the bash shell.  "help ulimit" will help you get started.

Try "echo ^Q^O".  You will need to type control-Q twice to get the ^Q
character, and use control-Q control-O to get ^O.  (This is again
assuming you are using bash.)

This seems to be most reasonable.  The technique (of bound programs)
was used in some old (CDC's NOS)? opsys developed before the mid 70's
as we studied the mechanism in school.

The concept is pretty clean and lets the user decide whether to incur
additional overhead for a given file or set of files.  Compressing
disk controllers would be the best bet as the main CPU is not used for
the work, but compressing blocks in the system could be quite time
consuming, expecially for one using, say, X11...

The binding mechanism is also quite general and would allow many more
features such as passwords for individual files, locking, etc.  This could
be especially valuable in an environment where filesystems could be
created on arbitrary sets of disk blocks (files) because then one could
implement the compress-each-block-of-the-fs type of fs also.

As long as there is no other disk activity going on, it is safe to run
fsck on a mounted partition just to check the correctness of the
partition.  However, if you are using the -r or -a options to repair a
filesystem, then there are basically two safe ways to go about it:

* Boot from a different filesystem (eg. from HJ's excellent bootable
  floppy rootdisk, from the GCC directory on tsx-11.mit.edu) and use
  the fsck there to check your primary root partition; or

* Using the latest kernel, elect to mount the root filesystem
  readonly; upon boot, run fsck on the partition, and once that has
  finished, remount root for writing and mount the other partitions.

The kernel code to support this is already present, and a version of
mount(8) which supports the necesary remounting of the root filesystem
should hopefully be available soon.

Cheers,
 Stephen Tweedie.

Try upgrading your shared libraries to libc.so.4.3.2 or later -
version 4.3.3 is the most recent.  Read the release notes carefully
before installing, and you should have few problems.  The libraries
are available in the /pub/linux/GCC directory on tsx-11.mit.edu.

I use g++-2.3.3 with libc.so.4.3.2 pretty extensively, and have had no
problems with it at all.

I love it.  I can swap code between the University's sun-4 system and
my Linux box at home, and the only difference I notice is that the
Linux box goes faster.  :-)

This is a well known bug with gcc, not just the Linux version.  Gcc will
take outrageous amounts of memory when compiling large static initialized
arrays. Fear not! there are people with such ridiculous amounts of memory
and swap space; Rob Hooft is one of them.  You can find his jump-tabled
compilations of lib<tiff|jpeg|etc> in /pub/Linux/apps/graphics/libgr-1.0.tar.z
on sunsite.unc.edu.

There is ported source for xv in /pub/Linux/X11/xapps/graphics/xv221.tar.z

  When I use the a1 bootdisk to do my install it recognizes my

problem is when it is all done installing and writes out the image
to disk to use as a bootdisk.  When I use that disk now it comes up
and then corectly identifies the scsi disk but then soon after it
errors with something about superblock reading and then says
that it is unable to mount the root partition.  I presume that since

Taylor UUCP is taking up 17 megs of disk space (yes, how absurd)
because the default compile flags include debugging information, and
apparently there is lots of it in Taylor uucp binaries.  Strip the
binaries and uucico will go from two-odd MB to 200k.

That's pretty serious.  I can't think of anything major which has
changed between pl4 and pl7 which could cause this, except for the
SCSI drivers.  I assume your partitions live on SCSI disks?

I think that the 0.99pl8 release cures the problems known to exist in
the pl7 SCSI code; you might want to see if this helps.  It may well
do.

> Anybody else noticed this?  Should I just switch to ext2?

Ext2 ought to give much better performance, but the extfs is probably
not responsible for your problems.  Try out 0.99pl8 first.

For plain vga (non-X) use dpg-view.  You will also need vgalib12.tar.Z
For X use xv.  An xv binary exists on sunsite.unc.edu, however it 
needs a rather large set of shared libs to run.

Note to sunsite admins: There was also a binary version of xv that
did not require these libs.  It went by the name xv-jmp.Z (I think).
It would be nice if it could be restored.

Thanks very much for the bug report.

I have twice noticed an unexpected "file not found" error under ext2fs,
but this was never associated with any filesystem corruption.  Being
unable to reproduce this problem, it has been extremely hard to trace.

This is the second report which looks as if it might be able to
reproduce the bug - if I can duplicate the effect then I'll hopefully be
able to get a bug fix soon.

If you any problems with the ext2fs which can be associated with any
particular behaviour (such as rename here), or which can be readily
reproduced, *please* let Remy Card <card@masi.ibp.fr> and myself know -
we are trying hard to make ext2fs the best filesystem we can, and your
feedback is greatly appreciated.

Which kernel are you using?  There was a known keyboard problem in
some of the 0.99pl7 releases which caused this type of effect; the
problem is cured in 0.99pl8.

It certainly is.  8MB is the general recomended minimum ram for
running X11 on Linux, because you are guaranteed to get a lot of
swapping with any less than this.  This is not anything specific to
Linux - the X server is simply _very_ big, so you will have the same
effect on any machine running X.  If anything, the problem is less
severe with Linux because of the quality of its memory management.
However, there is really no substitute for more memory here.

> Also, I'm using the e2fs for my main partition. What is the proper

You can run e2fsck with no options just to check your filesystem even
if it is mounted, as long as there are no applications writing to the
filesystem at the time.  If you need to do any repairs, the best way
is currently to boot of a floppy rootdisk and e2fsck from there.
There is currently work in progress to allow checking of the root
filesystem during boot, by mounting the root readonly during kernel
startup and only allowing root to be writeable after the fsck.

In the mean time, don't worry too much about the "filesystem not
valid" messages you get from e2fs at startup.  Just run e2fsck
whenever you have a system crash.

I tried the lesskey program that someone pointed out to me...
Wow, what a concept!  :)

Here's what I did:

I have a file called .lessrc that contains the following:

^[[B    forw-line       # down arrow
^[[A    back-line       # up arrow
^[[6~   forw-scroll     # page down
^[[5~   back-scroll     # page up
^[[1~   goto-line       # home
^[[4~   goto-end        # end 

(note:  the ^[ has to be an ESC  i.e. in vi, type "i" for input mode,
        press CTRL-v, and then press the Escape key.  I'm not sure if
        putting the '^' character and then the '[' character works.)

After you have this file, enter:
        lesskey .lessrc
and the file ~/.less will be created with the key sequences.
Now less recognizes your new key sequences.

When I compiled it under 0.99.7A on a 16MB 486/33, the machine appeared
to "hang" while compiling files for libtiff.a.  Under X, the mouse no
longer moved; outside X, I could still switch consoles, but could not
type anything at any of them.  This has to be more than just gcc or
bad options.  Had to hard-reset to reboot.

Fortunately, I didn't really need tiff support, so I just commented it
out of the makefile and went on my merry way... ;-)

SysAdmin...

  I never saw that, and I just spent a half day playing with quotas in a
course. When you hit hard quota you stop writing. After you have been
over soft quota for a given time (in sec up to weeks) you can't write
until you get below soft quota. I never heard of or saw the o/s zap data
for you.
| 
| 2) There must be a way for quotas to be maintained.  I think BSD's approach

|      called "quotas" which would determine the quotas of every user on the
|      system.

  There is a quota file for each filesystem, and it must be mounted with
the quota keyword to enable quotas. The quota is then kept "per user" in
terms of soft limit, hard limit, and time limit.
| 
| 3) Some library calls may need to be modified to handle quotas.  At the

|      (There is probably a standard for it.)

  Yes. I don't have a pure BSD system here, so I'm not sure if any of
this is Sun speciffic.

|

  I think quotad handles the timer after you go over soft limit, and the
kernel does the actual enforcement. It pretty much must be to work over
multiple processes.

| 
| 2 concepts of most quota systems:
|   1) Soft Quota -> If you exceed this quota, then the writes will succeed,
|       but you will be given a time period (i.e. 1 week) or a number of
|       login warnings (i.e. 3 logins) before the quota system will take
|       action.  Taking action usually means that any file that is written
|       to, and sometimes, any file that is read, will have its filesize
|       effectively changed to 0.  This would continue until the user
|       removes enough files to go under the quota, or the quota system
|       changes enough files to reduce the quota for the user...

  I've never seen space deleted for you, you just can't write until you
get down below soft limit. Of course that may be an option, but I've not
found it in the docs. The sysadm is usually the dark force, through
scripts.
| 
|   2) Hard Quota -> This one is set higher than the soft quota, and is the
|       absolute highest amount of disk space the user can use at any time.
|       If the hard quota is reached, whatever write was going on at the

|       will be left with a file that is incomplete, but uses up the rest
|       of the hard quota.

  It will need a bunch of kernel support, since it has to be done on a
per file owner basis. If I give you write on a file I own the size goes
against my quota, not yours. Non-trivial!

Why??  Use the lesskey program and the following input file like this:
    lesskey < lesskey.input

lesskey creates a file called .less in your home directory.  Try "man
lesskey" for info about it.  Maybe even "man less".

=====8<=====8<=====lesskey.input=====8<=====8<=====
^[[B    forw-line
^[[A    back-line
^[[6~   forw-screen
^[[5~   back-screen
^[[1~   goto-line
^[[4~   goto-end
^[[D    prev-file
^[[C    next-file
=====8<=====8<=====lesskey.input=====8<=====8<=====

Make sure the ^[ is an esc character.  You can create one of these files
with emacs by typing control-q before typing the key you want.

i.e.: <C-q><downarrow><tab>forw-line<enter>
      <C-q><uparrow><tab>back-line<enter>

and so forth and so on.  It's very easy doing it this way, and people
that call in to your system with different terminal types can create
their own .less files that work with their terminals.  No need to
recompile the darn thing.

Besides, if you get a newer version of less, it should see your key
mappings automagically... :-)

Hah!  If this is the same bug Carsten Fischer and I reported a little while

Well, there certainly seems to be a lot of interest in this, so I
though I'd post about work currently in progress on the ext2fs.

In outline:

    I am working on adding the option to transparently compress and
    uncompress ext2fs files.  Compression will be selectable on a
    file-by-file basis.

    This will be an enhancement to the existing ext2fs.  The new
    facility will be immediately useable by anybody with an ext2fs
    filesystem without requiring any reformatting.

The filesystem data structures and directory tree will remain
uncompressed for speed.  Uncompression of data should not be too slow;
the code is based on gzip which is already reasonably fast at
decompression.  Uncompressed data will be buffer-cached on the same
terms as raw device blocks, which will significantly improve
performance.

Done. :-)

I have a set of kernel patches which implement an extension to the
standard kernel inode operations, to increase the flexibility of the
demand paging software.  This will also incidentally allow demand
paging and caching of NFS data.

This work is already complete.  As an example, it is now possible to
demand-page binaries and shared libraries from an msdos floppy using
sector (512-byte) alignment, even though such a filesystem cannot
support the bmap() call previously necessary for demand paging.

With this extension, demand paging just degenerates to randomly
accessing compressed data.  I am storing a form of indirection data
within the file, similar to the inode's own direct/indirect block
pointers, which will allow random read access to the compressed file.

Incidentally, I don't intend (at least at first) to allow random
writes to the compressed file, but concurrent random reads will be
fully supported.

There is in the ext2fs, which is what I am basing my code on.

Yup - internal kernel compression/decompression.

Indeed.  It is also safer - you don't run nearly as much danger of
corrupting your entire filesystem if it is only individual files which
get compressed - more flexible, and faster (the high-level filesystem
data remains uncompressed).

The other advantage of per-file compression is that the superuser will
be able to directly access the raw compressed form of the data.  This
will allow quick backup/restore of compressed files, for example, and
will also allow suid-root programs to do their own compression on
files (to get better compression than the kernel's default faster
compression), or to repair or check for damaged compressed files.

It is definitely possible.  All of the necessary design details have
(I hope) been addressed, and I hope to get something working over the
Easter holidays.

There is a possible cause for this which has tripped up other users
before now.

The recent ext2fs now respects the FSIZE resource limit, as set by the
"ulimit" command in bash.  Type "ulimit -a" to see your current
limits.  If you have a filesize ulimit in place, then you can get "no
space left" errors even if there is space left on the device.

The next release of ext2fs will report "filesize limit exceeded" in
this situation rather than "no space left".

This was a known bug in e2fsprogs-0.2c.  Upgrade to version 0.2d.

Why not just .tar?  

It has been my experience that gzip is as much of a saving of space over
compress as compress is over normal files.  So if we can justify .Z files
we can use the same justification to use .z files instead.  What I find
interesting is that gzip and gunzip seems just as fast as compress and
uncompress.  So if I had my way, I would add in an option to use old style
compress with gzip and then do away with compress on any system that still
uses it!

Yes I haven't seen a system yet that properly handles hard quotas.  Most
systems will still let you write to /tmp so you just direct the normal
programs to put thier output to there and then take care of them before
logging out.  For the few systems that I've seen that aren't fooled by
placing the file in /tmp, they are fooled if you do a chown on the file
before you exceed your quota.  Installing a hard quota is by no means a
simple task.  For the most part, if you are using a file system that reserves
space for root, these shouldn't be neccissary.

Pretty cool. I have been waiting for somehting like this for some
time. I now have Babaya run in the foreground as the last command in
my ~/.xinitrc (well, pretty much the only one, all others I have moved
to Babaya's startup file), and besides shutting X gracefully, I can
now also quit gwm and start olvwm whenevr I feel bored with the former
(it used to be that quitting gwm shuts the server since it was run
last from ~/.xinitrc).

I have some questions, though:

1) Can I make Babaya use a different mouse key, or possibly a
   double-click? My hand is pretty quick with the right mouse button
   (blame olvwm for that!) and I don't want to logout if I happen to
   click on Babaya by accident.

2) Can I start Babaya as an icon?

3) Since it's pretty small (9k, linux shared libraries do wonders), is
   it a good idea to compile it with the gcc -N swicth? (there was a
   recent thread about that, but I'm afraid I didn't absorb all of
   it).

Thanks.

Subject: Memory problem with Linux?
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 23:39:55 GMT

        I think there may be a memory problem with Linux.  I have a 386,
33Mhz machine with 8Megs, and a 5 meg swap partition.  However, when I run
about 4 instances of xv (and load a JPG in each one) with other things
going on too (like seyon, and an xterm), the machine locks up.  The mouse
doesn't move, I can't switch to the other VCs or anything.  This seems to be
the same problem that people are having when they try to compile xv under
gcc.  It is using up all available memory, and locking.  What does Linux
do when it runs out of swap space, or memory in general.  Whatever it
does, it doesn't seem to be doing it correctly.  Also, I had a 234K JPG
picture that would lock up the machine EVERY time I tried to view it.  I
never have seen it.  JPGs are compressed very highly, so I imagine this
was a very very large picture.  With nothing running, when trying to view
this, it all locks up.
        Also I have locked the machine up while in X by trying to scroll very
quickly through a man page using xman.  This is recreatable, at least for
me.  I run xman, and then push the left mouse button very quickly on the
scroll bar, and it will lock the whole machine.  The mouse still moves,
but is the shape from the scroll bar.  Nothing else works.  No VC
switching or anything.
        I just thought I would point these out.

Hello Linux Users:

I heard about Linux OS only yesterday through a friend.

        The questions I have about this OS are:
        1. Is Linux a true clone of UNIX?
        2. Where from can I get a copy of this OS and how much does it cost?
        3. What are the Hardware requirements(Hard Disk size)?
        4. Do you get the X-Window system along with the OS?
        5. Is there a C++ compiler along with the system?

I have a 486 DX from Gateway2000 with the ATI video card and a FAX/Modem. Can
Linux be installed on this system?

All email replies are appreciated. Thank you in advance.

Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 00:38:40 GMT


Yes, I use a WD-7000FASST with Linux and it works great The ROM is only used
for identifying the card, so the rev shouldn't matter. What does matter, is
the address the ROM is on. The standard code starts looking for the ROM
signature from D8000 or smth like that. If your ROM lives at say c800, you
lose.
Also the driver is hard-programmed to use only one of (3?) possible
interrupts. So you either configure the card accordingly or make a trivial
changes to the device driver code and recompile. If you do, the system will
boot MUCH faster not looking for hardware that YOU KNOW is not there.

        No, it can't.  The remount call is handled by the VFS layer and the

The FSF says that the reason for replacing the de-facto standard (compress)
with gzip, was the potential legal problems with using a compression algorithm
which two seperate companies own patents on (IBM and Unisys, I believe).

Gzip's technical superiority is very nice, but apparently was a secondary
consideration.

        I agree whole-heartedly, such a feature is desperately needed if Linux
is to be more than a single-user OS (ala DOS). We don't want people to
switch to 386BSD, now do we? The thing that bothers me, is that someone
did write a quota patch, but it is out of date, and won't fit any newer
kernels. (without hacking on it). :(

(This is *not* a flame of Linux. It is a very good OS, it is much better
than DOS, but if it is missing a feature someone critically needs, they
simply can't use it, and that's a shame. I am afraid to do any major
work, as others may be, to improve Linux, for fear that one's work won't
make it into the kernel, and will thus break in a couple of months and
have to be redone, abandoned, or updated (or the person will have to
install the patch, then all the official patched till one reaches the
current patchlevel, and hope it still works/patches cleanly, etc.)

I thought that I would second Jim Graham's position that the Linux
community has
been incredibly helpfull and responsive.  I've been using Linux for 11
months now.
When I started off I knew nothing of Linux and little of UNIX.  I knew
NOTHING of
system administration.  Now, generally, I'm able to get things done, do
a bit of
programming, and in general have fun with the beastie.  I periodically post 
requests for help (for instance the mfm/ide thread) and have gotton an enormous
amount of help from more people than I can give sufficent credit to.  In
general I have found that if I wait a week between discovering a
'problem' and posting a
request for help I usually a) figure out the solution myself b) find
that someone
else has had the same problem and send him/her a request for the
solution c) find
that what I thought was the original problem wasn't.  If after a week
I'm still 
hosed, I post a request for help including what I think is going on.  Without
exception, I have gotton useful and prompt replies from more people than I can
give sufficient credit to.  What I really think 'newbies' need more than a 
special forum which alot of people will ignore, are large pink letters saying:
DON'T PANIC.  Be patient.  Read the documentation provided.  Try to isolate 
WHERE things are dying, and *ask* for help, don't demand psychic
software that does everything.  UNIX and subsequently Linux, is big,
MSDOS is simple but for that price, you get a glorified boot loader.

        Another way that works quite well is to only respawn uugetty at
init levels 5 and 6, or even just 6. Then if you want to call out, do
an init 4. The new duel package is supposed to fix all this though,
so hopefully all this wil be history soon.

Subject: Mounting an extended dos partition
Date: 14 Apr 93 13:51:19 GMT

My Dos disk is partitioned into two parts, a primary partion (C disk)
and an extended partition, with one logical partition (D disk).
There is no problem to mount the C disk with the command

   mount -t msdos /dev/hda1 /usr/dos

but the similar command

   mount -t msdos /dev/hda2 /usr/ddisk
or
   mount -t ext /dev/hda2 /usr/ddisk

fails with the error message

   mount: Unknown error 26240

I guess this is expected as /hda2 is not an 'msdos' partition
but an 'extended msdos' partition.

Has anybody overcome this problem? Does mount at all support
extended ms-dos partitions?

Mtools doesn't manage to access this partition either. My
/etc/mtools file looks as follows:

  A /dev/fd0H1440 12 80 2 18      # A: 5 1/4
  C /dev/hda1 16 0 0 0
  D /dev/hda2 16 0 0 0

But trying to access d: gives the error message:

Probable non-MSDOS disk
mdir: Cannot initialize 'D:'

Any solution to this?

   Yes, they are gzipped...GNU zip - check archie for availability. If

   what was wrong with .tar.Z?

The compress algorithm is covered by a patent, and may
be subject to royalty payments.  Besides, gzipped files
are usually a third smaller than compressed files.

Subject: An quick-fix to the static binaries issue
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 21:47:50 GMT

        I know many of you have discussed concern about messing up
installing shared libraries and then having nothing work. My solutios is
to make copies of my essential utilities, rm, sh, ln, ls, and so on with
the first letter capitalized. Then I edit those files so that instead of
looking for "libc..." they look for "Libc.." and I make a copy of the
library and symlinks with the first letter capitalized.

        Now if I mess up my libraries or symlinks I can use the
capitalized versions of those utilities to repair the damage. Easy. Works.

Subject: hooray! voodoo spell broken. network works now!
Date: 14 Apr 1993 23:19:52 GMT


a few days ago I posted that our networking had mysteriously died.
there were no obvious indications why: all I had done previously was
edit /etc/inittab and /etc/gettydefs to try and get a modem working.

then a reboot or two later, and the ethernet card would NOT transmit.
I would get wd8003 transmit timed out. errors in the logs.

I had a backup on tape, and I restored all of /etc, /etc/inet and the
kernel. the network still wouldnt work. ping would just generate
kernel errors (the wd8003 ...error). I thought this was a bit strange.

I restored any kernel I had saved. no luck. I built 99.8 from patches.
no luck. I built 99.8 fresh from the sources. no luck.

the only thing that worked was an old SLS boot disk.

Some e-mail correspondence suggested that I use the ethernet drivers
from ftp.super.org. Well whattaya know: that old SLS boot disk pops up
with a message attributing the drivers to super.org.

I cant explain why *several* kernels later, 99.7, 7A, etc. the net
still worked, then *without* even touching the kernel, it mysteriously
stops working. Anyway, I followed the instructions on ftp.super.org,
and I used those ethernet drivers to make a kernel that works with our
SMC 16 bit ethernet card.

So Im happy it works now. Anyone have theories about why it *stopped*
working, when there was no visble change to the files? (this is weird:
I restore files from a tape made from a *working* system, and the
system still wont work).  maybe the soft settings on the ethernet card
got twiddled , making it fail with my previously working kernel.

Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 22:46:52 GMT

Well, here's to life on the bleeding edge.

I initialy installed the new kernel, 99p8,
which caused xdm to fail.

- xdm comes up and presents login prompt
- login takes username and passwd
- seems to pass control to xinit
- then snaps back to the login

So, switch back to 99p7A.

Lilo 0.10 comes out.  Install lilo
boots fine.  
Now X wont even come up!  Both for the 99p8 kernel
and the 99p7A kenel.

- startx runs and sets userresources and systemresources
- xinit gets called
- xinit dies with ..

Fatal server error:

server is already active for display 0

What is that now?
Thouroughly baffled.  Any help appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: About disk quotas...
Date: 15 Apr 1993 01:32:04 GMT

I have a thought on quotas...  my thinking originates from experience
as a Novell programmer.  I'm no Un*x expert, and I'm new to Linux, but I
do write code and have I think enough understanding of how things work to
suggest a possible solution...

I think a quotad would work... hang-on, don't flame me just yet... :-)

        1) Make a filesystem limit using *directories*.  If quotas were based
        on "max K per directory", this could very easily be translated to a 
        user basis, since most users (that you'd want to restrict) don't have
        write privs. outside of /usr/spool, /tmp, and their home dir.  You
        wouldn't want to limit the spool and tmp dirs much, except maybe alert
        root when a user's usage gets large without shrinking.  Limit the home
        directory.

        2) Home dirs are limited by belonging to root or somesuch, with 
        g+rwx (where g is just root & the user).  When the user's disk space
        gets large enough, the daemon just turns off g+w in the home dir, and
        a+w in all subdirs (recursively).

        3) Quotad should e-mail both the user & root (or other admin) whenever
        it takes action.

Problems to overcome:

        1) quotad should know about mail spool dir, and use that when changing
        permissions on home dir.  Users could still cheat, but they would have
        to use the spool dir.  This is usually more inconvienent than tarring 
        and zipping or removing files in the users home dir (to the user).

        2) quotad must know how to restore the rights to a users dirs at any
        given time.  In particular, it should restore the "w" rights only if
        they were there before.  This may be overcome in 1 of two ways (others?)

                i) use some sort of database file to store original permissions.
                ii) use extra permissions bits or inode bits if 3 bits can be found.
                        (try to avoid using inode bits to maintain fs portability)

        3) user-owned sub-dirs... may be problematic.  User could reset the
        permissions if he owns them.  Perhaps this can be solved by having
        quotad automatically change subdir ownership at the same time that 
        it does chmod....

Advantages:

        1) filesystem and kernel independent.  (yay!)
        2) spool files unaffected.  (allows printing of big postscript files
        and creation of temporary files)  We use this type of restriction    
        instead of the user quotas in Netware 3.11 because users frequently 
        spool postscript files that are bigger than any quota we would give them,
        but these spools are very temporary.

        3) No problems if user does chown.

Disads:

        1) can only be done to certain dirs?  user doesn't get write access
        elsewhere, or if he does it is unrestricted...  ideas for fixes..

        2) probably a kludge that is not terribly difficult to get around.
        A kernel based solution would be more secure.

Any Linux hackers out there want to comment on this idea?  Is it feasible?
Is it worth it?  Is anyone working on a kernel or fs-based solution?

What I would like, (and I feel is logical, but that is just my opinion), is
that the above command '8dd4..' would be intepreted as:
put 8 as a numeric argument in the Global Counting Register
dd delete lines... how many? 8, since that is what is the the GCR (:-)
put 4 as a numeric argument in the global counting register (GCR for short)
. repeate last 'action' (which was dd) with the GCR
(implied: put 1 in GCR)  <--------------------- Note this line.......
. repeat last 'action' (dd) with the GCR which (IMHO) should contain 1,
i.e. delete one line.

This is what I think is logical, but you are of course free to
have your own views about that :-)

It would seem to me, from a new sysadmin standpoint, to have
anyone but root able to use chown. At least that's how it's done
here on the Ultrix systems at our site. Our system works as
follows as far as quotas:

1) If the file is in the middle of a write when you exceed your
quota, the file will be written in its entirety and not
truncated. Any furthur write requests will be denied

If you don't have any disk space when you start writing a file,
you will be told you have exceeded the quota.

I have been struggling with the following problem since I started

I have a 486, 8Mb, with a Trident 8900c video-card, and I have

Can somebody with a bit more insight that me try to point me in the

It also seems like there are some other Trident 8900 - persons who

I have seen a very similar problem involving "elm" and "vi".  If you are
composing mail under elm, it invokes your EDITOR, in my case vi.  If you
suspend from the editor with ctrl-Z and then resume it with "fg", it
appears input is being read simultaneously from vi and elm.  Anyone else
have any clues?  Perhaps some weirdness with process groups, or with
interrupted system calls?

By the way, either elm or vi by themselves seem to handle ctrl-Z just fine.

Date: 14 Apr 93 21:40:09 GMT


I'm sorry if this is a FAQ.

I have successfully partitioned my hard disk and installed Linux SLS 0.99p6

/dev/hda:

        C: 1 active MSDOS
           2        Linux ex2fs
           3        Linux ex2fs

I then reinstalled MSDOS on partition 1, which first made me reformat
partition 1 and then reinstalled, successfully, I was told by MSDOS
setup :-(. I can mount the MSDOS partition under Linux, but MSDOS
fails to boot from the harddisk.  The MSDOS filesystem is OK, as I can
'dir' it when booting MSDOS from floppy.

Somebody said MSDOS is touchy and needs to be installed *before* any
Unix(Linux) on the other primary partitions.

Is is the MBR (master boot record) on the disk which is the problem?

When I try to boot, the BIOS tells me "missing operating system".

Thanks,

go completely and utterly crazy; not moving where he's supposed to,
randomly clicking buttons without my fingers, driving me essentially crazy :)

I do not have anything that has conflicting inturrupts (Modem on com2, no
printer.  SBlaster card on IRQ7). 

Any thoughts at all what might be causing this?  I've made two recent
changes to the system.  Upgrade to pl8 and change from efs to e2fs.

Thanks for your time.

I noticed this too.  An excerpt from the GCC manual:

|    * GNU CC will flag unterminated character constants inside of

|      comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if

|           You can't expect this to work.
|           #endif
| 
|      The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an

As far as I know this isn't related to gcc, other vendors compilers do the same.

Actually, since the shell can simulate cat with:

You can cp with this, so that should be all you need. Just a bash process,

Subject: NFS troubles
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 93 21:41:03 GMT

First let me say that I'm sorry about causing unneeded traffic in
this newsgroup by asking questions that I should have been able
to figure out for myself.  Specifically, I'm referring to my last
post in which I asked why networking on my system wasn't working
anymore after I upgraded to libc 4.3.3.  Yesterday I reread the
release note for libc 4.3.3 and I discovered that it indeed
mentioned that you need to move the networking files to /etc.
Somehow or another I missed seeing this when I read the file before.
In the future I will endeavor to carefully read all the release
notes and FAQs before posting to this group.  This isn't the first
time that I've had to eat my own words. :-)

I realize that this group gets a lot of traffic so I will try to
minimize my postings by going through all the relevant docs first
and corresponding with people via email.  Whenever possible I do
try to figure things out first.  As a matter of fact, I've helped
out a number of people myself by way of email...the reverse is also
true.  I suggest that other people do the same whenever possible.
BTW, I think the creation of c.o.l.a. was a great idea.  If we
didn't have this newsgroup then it would take a lot more time to
wade through c.o.l. to find info on new releases and important
notices.  My compliments to the people who thought up this group.

Now here is a *real* problem I'm having.  After upgrading to the
new version of mount I've been unable to mount a directory using
NFS.  I have my Linux system networked to a Sun 386i.  I can't
mount any of the Sun's directories onto my Linux system.  When I
was using an old version of mount with .99pl7 (I'm still using
that kernel btw) NFS worked just fine.  Now it doesn't.  I
understand that a new version of the NFS server has been released.
If I get this then will my problems go away?  I suspect that mount
may be the culprit but it's possible that libc 4.3.3 is causing
this problem.  Here's what happens when I try to mount a remote
directory:

    mount hoek:/disk /mnt
    mount: No such file or directory

I telnetted over to the Sun and mounted one of the directories over
on the Linux system (mount stimpy:/ /mnt; stimpy is the name of my
Linux box).  This worked just fine.  When I try to mount one of the
Sun's volumes onto the Linux system I get the error message above.
Also, I was unable to mount / and /usr.  I got the same error message
as before.

I've checked the exports file on the Sun and everything appears to
be in order.  This problem is truly puzzling.  I'd really appreciate
it if someone could help me out.

Again, let me say that I greatly appreciate all the help that I've
gotten so far.  A number of diiferent people told me how to fix
networking and install the new libraries.

I am trying to compile a sudo program, but I am having trouble.  It uses
yacc and lex, and therefore links with the liby and libl librearies, which 
I don't seem to have.  Does anyone know where I could fine them? I am

I tried out the su1 program, but I didn't like having to type a password for

verification, instead of different ones for different commands.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I've checked the FAQ for this, but no luck:

I'm running 0.99.8 and I made a 32M swap partition.  mkswap tells me
that it's allocated that much room, but swapon tells me it's only added
16M, and free corroborates this.  Is this a hard limit, or can I tune

For more information read on ...

*** Linux Documents Explained for Newbies (like me 8-) *** is is posted weekly

I don't know very much about the SLIP protocol, but I have used
Lantastic/Z (the serial port/modem version) over a 56k bps cord (from my
486 to my old Compaq Portable with its 8086) and performance was very
acceptable, considering this was over a standard serial line.  It was
slow, but I wasn't booting something huge over the "network" either.  I

Subject: New version of MCC interim Linux available
Date: 15 Apr 93 06:42:17 GMT

I sent a message some days ago to comp.os.linux.announce, but it seems
to have got lost.

I have released the current MCC interim version of Linux (0.99-p8)
for anonymous ftp from ftp.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.203.12].  This version
is available only with the UK keyboard, but it takes little effort
to recompile the kernel.

Having learned a few things from SLS, there are only two disk images.
Other software is included as packages.  The packages are not divided
into subdisk directories, but should be copied to DOS or Minix disks.
All packages fit on three 3 1/2 or four 5 1/4 inch disks, as explained
in the README files.  Software on these 5 or six disks include source
and binary for the kernel (0.99 patch level 8), gcc (2.3.3 with libs
4.3.3), the usual GNU software (now including flex), kermit, groff,
and tcpip software, though the latter is still somewhat buggy.

A new package includes all patches which were used to compile the included
software.  Source for all software is available for anonymous ftp from
ftp.mcc.ac.uk.

This release comes with many README files, including a walk-through
README.install.  All binaries were compiled with this release of gcc and
with this version of the libraries, except for gcc and the binutils,
which are as HJ Lu released them.

MCC interim Linux is not intended to be an 'official' release, or to
compete with any other release.  It is a small, moderately well tested
version into which other packages (like X, TeX, and emacs) plug without
difficulties.  It was developed and first released over a year ago

Seagulls are nasty dirty birds -- sailors call them "flying

as chickens or pigeons.

Hmm...  I liked the narwhal idea... same with the platypus.

Linux is a little bit unconventional (at least at this stage
in its existence), and a narwhal or platypus would reflect
that.

Sea (C) creatures in general are fun only becuase of the C,
so my vote goes for the narwhal.  (Besides which, narwhals
can be fast and sleek, live in the north, and have spurned
stories of mythological creaturs (unicorns)).  "What?  free

Remember, if you need more virtual memory you can add a swap file (if 
you have the disk space).  I needed this when I compiled sunclock.
The procedure may be in the FAQ.

        MS-DOS is *so* brain-damaged in this respect it isn't even funny, it is
really perverse and sad. I get the same "missing operating system"*
error if I make the DOS paritition in a politically incorrect manner. To
have it work, you probably have to make a DOS partiton under DOS (there
are undocumented/poorly documented restrictions on DOS partitions, I
think in my case (and yours too, since you mention starting at partition
1) it was starting it right at sector (?) 1, instead of a little ways
after there like DOS wanted. Maybe it needs space at the beginning
before the real partition begins for bott info/code. If they were smart,
that would go *inside* the partition... Sigh.

        Try making DOS paritions under DOS, and Linux partitions under Linux
and you should be okay.

P.S. DOS really sucks when it comes to trying to create two DOS
partitons too! Actually DOS fdisk is a hose in general. (I needed to
when copying my DOS files from one part of the HD to another so I could
optimize the placement of my Linux partitions. Not a fun experience).

* Missing Operating System, how appropriate. DOS isn't an OS ;)

As far as I am aware, (and no doubt plenty of people will be willing
to jump down my throat if I'm wrong :-) the "enable >16MB memory"
option of the kernel just allows the kernel to use more than 16MB of
memory.  It doesn't do anything special about restricting access to
memory above 16MB.

For hardware on the ISA bus which can only access memory below the
16MB boundary, it is the responsibility of that hardware's device
drivers to ensure that this restriction is respected.  All of the
relevant Linux device drivers do this anyway, so although the user may
see slightly less performance doing IO with the larger memory size,
any incompatibilities with more memory should be safely hidden from
the affected hardware.

Using more than 16MB ram should be safe - the kernel configuration
script was recently changed so that allowing larger memory is now the
default.

 Stephen Tweedie.

On many Unix systems it is not necessary to use dd at all - you can
just copy the data to the disk using "cp".

For example, to copy a plain disk image to disk on a sun4, (where
/dev/rfd0c is the raw block device associated with the 3.5" drive,)
you can use
        cp <image> /dev/rfd0c
or even
        cat <image> > /dev/rfd0c
and if you have a compressed disk image, you can just use
        zcat <image.Z> > /dev/rfd0c

If you have to use 'dd', then it is probably best to select a 9K block
size for 3.5" disks: use
        dd bs=9k if=<image> of=/dev/rfd0c
or
        dd bs=9k < <image> > /dev/rfd0c

Try using cp or cat first - it's probably the easiest way.

Cheers,
 Stephen Tweedie.

Not really.  For example, I might want the directory structure to
remain uncomressed for speed, and I might want to have a quick
compression routine apply to most files for speed but with the option
of doing a slower, more thorough compression on some large, seldomly
changed files.

The biggest problem with a compressed disk is that as the data on the
disk changes, its capacity will vary - some files can be compressed
more than others.  This means that either the filesystem must be aware
of the disk compression system, or that the compressor be aware of the
filesystem structure.  For example, SuperStor and Stacker for DOS do
this - they fill up the filesystem allocation table with dummy used
blocks to change the apparent size of the filesystem according to the
real free space left.

Compression at the filesystem level offers far more flexibility, and -
perhaps more importantly - it is less likely to corrupt your entire
filesystem.

I don't have the source at hand here at work, but it was only one file
in the tiff library - I think one of the CCITT support files.
I just had to wait for it to compile - took about 15 to 20 min. on a
486 DX2/50 with 8 MB RAM and 16 MB swap, linux 0.99.6, gcc 2.3.3.

Don't forget to arrange to build libtiff.a with -traditional option.

Otherwise xv compiled cleanly out of the box.

Object-C runtime library is changing/improving all the time since
2.3.3. I could include Object-C in the next release. But I have no
idea if they work or not since I don't know Object-C. If someone
could send me a comprehensive Object-C program, I would be glad to

CPU : Linux runs fine on any processor that can run it.  It's very
fast, disk accesses, vi, the VTxxx console will all blaze on a 
lowly 386sx-16.  

For CPU intensive tasks, like compiling, I'd want at least a 
386-33.

Note that memory is more important than raw CPU speed - without 
enough, you'll be paging to disk that's 1000 times slower than
real memory.  

Memory : 

2M is the *bare* minimum on which Linux will run.  We've run it 
on 2M laptops and not had any problems if we didn't compile anything 
(ie, just a few shells, vi, and terminal emulation).

Note that with only 2M, you won't be able to install directly 
off of the SLS distribution.  Instead, you'll need to boot 
single user first (ie no memory eating init, etc), make swap
space, and then do your install.

4M is the *bare* minimum to do any sort of real work.
With 4M, the system will be usable if you aren't running X.  
While gcc 1.37 ran fine in 4M with no paging, GCC has grown considerably, 
and will page when optomizing in a mere 4M of memory.  X will swap some 
with the monochrome server, but will still be usable (don't run GCC at 
the same time!), with the larger color server, you won't be happy 
at all.

8M lets X run happily.  You'll still have some paging when running 
big applications, but it won't be thrashing.  With 8M (I've 
pared down the kernel, and turned off BIOS shadowing to 
gain a few hundred K) I can keep the load average > 1.0 when
running X and doing builds.

IMHO, you should invest in at least another 4M of memory ($100
if you buy used SIMMs).

More memory will let your cache grow larger, and will mean you
have even less paging, both very good for performance.

Disk : 

It depends on how many goodies you want installed, how much 
swap you want, etc.

If you pare it down enough, you can fit Linux on virtually 
any size partition.  Before I got my .12 kernel happy with 
the bad blocks on my MFM drive, I ran it from my error 
free 10M partition, with all of /bin, /usr/bin, vi,
gcc 1.37, 'C' libraries and other goodies.  However,
this isn't very realistic if you want fun toys like 
X, Tex, etc.

To handle memory hogging programs like GCC (when compiling 
large initialized arrays, GCC can eat 16M of virtual memory!) 
you should have a reasonable amount of virtual memory, say
24M, with a bare minimum of 12M if you're running X, 
8M if not.

Since Linux doesn't back store, virtual memory is equal
to swap space + real memory, so with 8M of memory you'd 
want to dedicate a single 16M partition to swapping.

Linux binaries are *small* because they use shared libraries.
I've run Linux + all of X11R5 + GCC + many other GNU goodies 
on a 40M partition (with separate swap, 5M to spare after 
kernel sources were installed).

My current set up is 16M of swap + ~95M for Linux.  I have 
a fairly complete installation, with X11R5, TeX, two 
LISP interpreters, and all sorts of goodies like Ghostscript,
both byacc and bison, etc.  With kernel sources, .o's and 
other cruft lying around, I have over 30M of free space.

So, I'd say a comfortable minimum would be 40M without X and 
large numbers of goodies, 60M with X and more goodies,
plus enough swap space to get you a reasonable amount of virtual
memory.

A few other comments on disk : 

Like memory, more is always better.  If you get the urge to 
compile GCC yourself, you'll need over 30M of disk.  A make
World on the X11 tape can eat over 150M.  

Swapping should be to a partition, since swapping through
the filesystem is much slower.  However, Linux supports
multiple swap files/devices, and in an emergency you can
add a swap file to suplement a minimally size swap partition.

>- Recommended hard disk space?

See above.

>- Can Linux run DOS apps? To what extent?

There is a DOS emulator that can handle some real mode BIOS and DOS using 
programs.  Things that get into hardware beyond the video frame buffer
won't work, 386 programs are out.
 
>- Is cohabitation of DOS on the same HD simple or a headache?

It's extremely simple - you have separate DOS / Linux partitions,
and can use a master boot record that prompts you for what to 
boot when you powerup.

From Linux, you can also directly access your DOS files, with 
all necesarry translations performed on text files (ie, CR/LF
combinations become newlines, etc).

>- What level of technical knowledge is required to install it?

With the stock SLS distribution, if everything works correctly 
you plug in a disk, insert the second disk, and 
follow the instructions.

You'll need to understand partitioning, and other PC basics.

To install separate goodies that have been ported, you'll
need to be familiar with Unix.

To install unported goodies, you may need an understanding 
of 'C', and Unix from a programer's level (ie, terminal
handling, replacing /dev/kmem accesses in things like 
xload and GNU make with the appropriate /proc reads, etc).

To keep things running smoothly, you should understand 
Unix as a user, and have some idea about system Administration - 
ie, where things go, what should be in /etc/rc, etc.

stuff on the 120, so I put linux on the 40, just to look at it (no flames,
please).  liked it, so I bought a 240MB drive.  I don't want to re-install,
so how do I move it over?  here are the details:

i have temporarily removed the 120MB.  
I partitioned the 240 into a 100MB DOS partition, 140 MB linux partition.
the 240 is HD0, the 40 is HD1  (the 120 was HD0, the 40 has always been HD1).
i boot from my linux boot floppy, no problem.
i ran fdisk to create the linux partition.  its there, no problem.
i changed the linux partition to type efs  (extended file system).
saveed changes, quit fdisk
rebooted
did 'mkefs /dev/hda2 140224'  (140224 is the size as reported by fdisk)
did 'mount /dev/hda2 /new'  

this is where the problem sets in, i get 'unknown error xxxxx'
i also tried modifying the fstab file, to no avail.

i am new to this, if it is not obvious.  what i want, if someone can tell
me how to get there, is:
to have the 120 back as HD0, and the 240 as HD1, and have the boot floppy
boot to partition 2 on the 240.

i really don't want to ftp another 80 disks or whatever, so if someone can
help me out i would really appreciate it.  btw, i am using the SLS release
from mid-march.  please reply via e-mail, as i cannot keep up with this
group.  thanks a lot!

yes yes yes... the getty_ps2.0.6 package is BROKE! BROKE! BROKE!

getty_ps2.0.7 is coming tomorrow (I hope?)  I can't exactly guarantee
that it will work on everybody's system, but I guess that's how it
goes with free software.  I can say this... I am very confident in it,
have tested it a _lot_, ironed out all of the bugs that I knew of in
the last release, added some new stuff, and on and on and on.

It is very worth the wait.  I sure hope nobody will ever have to
do things like

  kill -1 pid; kermit

to dial out ever again.  Look for it tomorrow (late at night if you live
in the US... that's my way)

Add more swap space - on my machine, I have 24M of virtual memory,
8M of real and 16M of swap.  I had no problems compiling xv, and haven't 
locked the machine since I upgraded from 14M of virtual memory (4M + 
10M swap).

Subject: Is it possible to use OS/2 & Linux w/o Bootmanager??
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 23:13:50 GMT

After a lot of playing around with some hard-drives I have finally
settled down on a 120meg IDE, with possibly another 80mb one waiting
in the wings.  I have OS/2 2.1 beta currently running smoothly on the
120 meg drive with no boot manager.  When I get the other drive 
running I want to install Linux on it, and I want to use Lilo instead
of the Boot Manager (with past experience I found that Bootmanager
was screwing up somewhere and not allowing me to boot Linux).  Can
I use Lilo as I would have under DOS?

Subject: e2fs Problems/Queries
Reply-To: i1041301@ws.rz.tu-bs.de
Date: Wed, 14 Apr 1993 19:42:06 GMT

I have just finished porting my entire linux configuration from old MFM hard
disks to a new AT bus disk, and am trying ext2 for the first time.
Unfortunately, when turning off the kettle, by force of habit, I turned off the
power at the mains, and caused my linux to crash.  On rebooting, I had some
strange effects.

Firstly, e2fsck noted that my root partition was not ok.  It corrected the
problem.  Calling e2fsck twice for the same partition, however, resulted it
e2fsck again thinking that the fs was not ok, and again it wanted to correct
it.  I also used e2fsck on the /usr fs, but with the same effect.  Silly of me,
thought I; I should boot from a diskette and then run e2fsck on an unmounted
partition.

I booted from disk, and tried e2fsck on root. Again it corrected errors.  The
second time, though, after the checking, it reported no further errors.  I then
ran e2fsck on /usr.  After a while, I got "out of memory" errors (I have 8 MB),
and my system hanged.

Pushed the reset button, rebooted from dikette.  I altered /etc/fstab and
/etc/rc to avoid mounting /usr automatically when booting, and then booted from
the hard disk.  I ran e2fsck on both partitions.  After initial errors on /usr,
e2fsck apparently no longer finds errors.  In nevertheless never thinks that
the partitions are clean, and continues to insist of checking everything in
full before coming to the conclusion that things are ok.

Question: How do I get e2fsck to immediately recognise that both partitions are
clean?

Question:  Worse, is the fact the e2fsck (0.2d) does not regognise the partions
are being clean an indication that permanent damage to the fs has been done?

Subject: ** Linux Documents Explained for Newbies **  Weekly Post
Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 07:00:46 GMT

  This post is sent weekly to the comp.os.linux newsgroup after numerous
people suggested I make it a regular thing. Any comments? Contact me...

======= *** Linux Documents Explained for Newbies (like me 8=) *** ========

Have any of you (relatively) new Linux users felt rather intimidated
by all the *** READ THE FAQ BEFORE YOU BOTHER US GURUS *** type posts,
then gone out and retrieved the numerous FAQ's (after wasting a lot of
time filtering through all the docs etc), read them, then still been
flamed for not finding something in the FAQ? Well, I kinda felt that 
way, so I am compiling a very brief (and hopefully understandable) list
of what the various docs are that you may need and why.

Here it is:

=======================================================================

I. Where to find them:

     - most of the docs are posted to comp.os.linux (c.o.l) every
         couple of weeks. If you are patient you'll see them.

     - By ftp try:

         tsx-11.mit.edu (18.172.1.2) in /pub/linux
         sunsite.unc.edu (152.2.22.81) in /pub/Linux
         nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) in /pub/OS/Linux

     - By mail server try:
 
         mailserver@nic.funet.fi
         mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu
         ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com

     - If none of those work then try asking Ian Jackson (who's post
         *** READ THIS BEFORE POSTING *** should also be read) by
         email (ijackson@nyx.cs.du.edu)


II. What document files are available and should you get:

     - INFO-SHEET - This file explains what Linux is, its features,
                    hardware supported, some software ported, and
                    (very important) where to get Linux via ftp or
                    snail mail. (in docs/)

     - META-FAQ - Lots of useful information on where to find more
                  information about Linux (get this one for sure).
                  (in docs/)

     - faq.p1.mmmyy - The FAQ itself comes in 4 parts. This is the
     - faq.p2.mmmyy   mother of all Linux documentation. These four
     - faq.p3.mmmyy   files are a *must* if you plan to use Linux.
     - faq.p4.mmmyy   (The FAQ is updated regularly, hence the date
                       extension. e.g. mmmyy = feb93) (in docs/FAQ)

     - faq.toc.mmmyy - Table of Contents for the FAQ. A must-get in
                       order to avoid massive amounts of time waste
                       picking through the four FAQ volumes.
                       (in docs/FAQ)

     - NET-FAQ - Documentation on networking Linux. This is in
                 addition to Chapter XI of the FAQ. (in docs/)

     - LILO-QUICKSTART-1.1 - How to install LILO (the disk booting
                             program). (in docs/)

     - FAQ - GCC FAQ (rather poorly named IMHO). (in packages/GCC)

     - ext2fs.faq - FAQ regarding the ext2fs utility (i.e. the second
                    version of the extended filesystem program).
                    (in ALPHA/ext2fs)

     - drivers.doc.z - a gzipped file containing all the information you
                       you should need to know for writing a driver for
                       Linux. Read this before you even think about writing
                       your own driver. (in ALPHA/drv_guide)

     - bbs.list - List of various BBS and ftp sites where you can find 
                  Linux files.

iii. Information for SLS!!! (every newbie needs this 8-)

     - DOWNLOADING - Information on how to get the SLS disks.
                     (in packages/SLS)

     - NOTICE - Information on warranty, restrictions, etc for SLS.
                Check this one out. (in packages/SLS)

     - COPYING - The GNU General Public License document. (in packages/SLS)

     - RELEASE - Information on what is in the latest release of SLS.
                 (in packages/SLS)

     - ChangeLog - History of changes to Linux and SLS. (in packages/SLS)

     - README - Most important document on SLS installation etc. You
                *will* need this for installing SLS. (in packages/SLS)

     - SLS.FAQ - The real thing. Two pages of questions you will come
                 come across (complete with answers, too 8-).
                 (in packages/SLS)

iv. Comp.os.linux.announce (c.o.l.a) information:

     - The newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce is a moderated newsgroup where
         the *latest, greatest* stuff regarding Linux is posted.

     - C.o.l.a [I love that acronym for this group 8-)] is archived in
         several places:

             - sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/linux-announce.archive
             - nic.funet.fi: /pub/OS/Linux/doc/news/COLA

=====================================================================

  From what I've seen so far there is a lot of information contained
in these documents. Also examine every README type file you find (e.g
README.tapes explained all I needed to know to get my SCSI tape stuff
going). A nice trick for finding these files is to get the find-ls
file from the archives then grep it for README, FAQ, DOC, etc.

   i.e. grep README find-ls | more

  For information on non Linux specific stuff check the corresponding
newsgroup for FAQ information (e.g. comp.unix.questions, comp.lang.c,
etc). Also, all the Internet FAQs are archived on rtfm.mit.edu. Check
it out if you have questions about other subjects.

  BTW, for those of you with ftp access, here's a neat little trick you
may not know about. To view a file on the archive without first
transfering it to your machine type:

      ftp>get filename |more

NOTE: NO SPACE BETWEEN THE | AND more!!! This is really handy for looking
      at README files etc, and general file browsing.

HINT: The unix grep command is *REALLY* useful when looking for specific
      information in the documents! 8-)

     be included, please let me know.

...allowing one to go to other vc's *is* the correct behaviour! What happens

From: jkaidor@synoptics.com (Jerome Kaidor)
Subject: Automated Linux PowerDown
Date: 14 Apr 93 21:51:51 GMT
Reply-To: jkaidor@synoptics.com


    A few weeks ago, I cut my home uucp node over to linux.  Goodbye, Dos!  And good riddance.
Now uucico runs off a crontab that periodically checks for outgoing mail, occasionally polls for
incoming mail, and in general, chugs away in the background.  I even turned the sound off on
the modem, so that uucico's entry onto the PSTN is announced by a mere *click*.  Just like a real
network!

   Now,  for my purposes, linux has only one disadvantage, as compared to dos.  I'd like to address
it:  with DOS, you can generally dump the computer's power any time that you see that dos prompt.
With any unix, you have to be more careful... Why is this important?

   Previously, my computer was on a 24-hour timer, which turned it on at 3:00 in the morning 
( or thereabouts ), and turned it off at 5:00 AM ( or so ).  The intervening two hours were enough
for the machine launch uucico and pick up my mail.  Then during the day, I would turn the computer
on manually, and do my usual stuff.

    According to my calculations, leaving the computer on 24 hours/day will eat $10-$20 worth of
electricity.   I, personally, have no problem with this, but my wife might well disagree.

    Accordingly, I have thought up the following hardware/software solution:

    1)  I build a box that allows the computer to turn itself *off*.
    2)  I let the 24-hour timer turn the computer *on*.
    3)  A cron script turns the computer off if:
          a)  The computer has been on for a few hours ( or maybe, that the automated nighttime tasks are finished )
          b)  It's early in the morning ( 4:00 AM or so )
           c)  There are NO USERS ( nobody logged in )

   Of course, a software-only solution is possible, where a crontab just syncs and halts the computer
when the conditions are met, but I don't like this because:
    1)  The computer and timer could get out of sync, and the timer could power-down in the middle of something.
    2)  The computer would always be turned on much longer than necessary to do its actual work.

    For the hardware part of this solution, I prefer to keep it simple.   I would still use the mechanical 24-hour 
timer, but set it so that it only supplied power for a little while, say, 15 minutes.   It would plug into a box,
built by me, that would contain a relay to bypass the timer as soon as power came on.   The relay would be
turned off by a circuit that looked at an output of the computer.  But what output?

    I was thinking of using one of the DTR lines on the serial ports.  Trouble with them, is that you really don't know
what will happen to them during bootup, etc.  One glitch, and BZZZzzzzz*.   My solution to the problem of unknown
states and glitches is to place some very specific requirements on the computer's output.   Specifically, a simple circuit
consisting of a comparator, a couple of capacitors, a resistor or two, and a diode, would make the turn-off circuit only
trip when a large group of *pulses*  came out of the computer.  Now, it's probably not usual to see
a couple thousand pulses come out of a DTR output, is it? 

    Anybody have any comment on all this?   I'm sorry, it's not totally Linux-specific, but I figured that some other linux'ers
out there might be interested, too..  I don't think my situation is all that unusual.

Actually, the quote was from someone else, but I haven't any idea who.

I should like to mention that there is available for anonymous ftp
a large collection of Linux binaries (in fact a whole system).  This
is at ftp.mcc.ac.uk [130.88.203.12] in /pub/linux/binaries.  The area
is actually NFS mounted by several local Linux installations to save on
disk space.  If you want a single command, you might want to check there.
However, (1) these commands are sometimes compiled with hard-coded
pathnames which may not suit your taste; for example, shutdown looks
for /bin/umount, not /etc/umount, and (2) this area is constantly being
updated, so please don't assume it will remain the same from day to day.

Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 05:32:55 GMT

I maintain a periodic posting of "Linux uucp/news/mail FAQs"
that I have a deamon posting twice per month to comp.os.linux...

My question is "should this be posted to c.o.l. or to c.o.l.a?"
to make it more visible ?

It might make it easier for people to find them if we could agree
on some kind of unique Subject that might appear to tell people
that this is a periodic posting of FAQ-type material.

(in my case, it's a linux-specific FAQ that I personally feel
        should *not* be cross-posted to news.answers).

Also, I have some great perl-based code called 'post_faq' that
automates this procedure wonderfully...if anybody else is doing
so by hand, you need to query archie and grab it :-)

I've heard the rumor expressed above, but it doesn't make sense to me.

An EISA motherboard begins each bus cycle with EISA signalling, hoping
it will select an EISA adapter.  The selected EISA adapter sees its
address, and it asserts the signal EX32* or the signal EX16* to say
"Here I am, an EISA adapter!  Let's do a fast EISA cycle!"

If there's no EX16* or EX32* pulse, the motherboard says "Oh rats, I
have to do a slow ISA cycle for this crummy old ISA adapter I appear
to be talking to."  An AT-style ISA adapter asserts the signal IOCS16*.
If there's no pulse on any of those signals, the motherboard says
"Wow, it's a dusty old XT-style adapter, I'll have to do a r-e-a-l-l-y
s-l-o-w 8-bit cycle!"  I've never heard of a motherboard that
remembers from one cycle to the next what kind of cycle each slot
prefers.  The adapters recognize their addresses and say what they
are, on each access.  If you know of an EISA motherboard that doesn't
start each cycle with EISA signals, please mail me.

A motherboard that tries to do an ISA cycle to an EISA adapter because
there's an ISA or XT adapter in *another* slot is seriously broken.
An adapter that asserts IOCS16* when it's not selected is broken also.
(To save cost, some EISA adapters perform ISA cycles when their
non-critical resources are selected, but that's irrelevant here.)
That's why I can't understand this rumor about ISA boards slowing
EISA boards down.

It depends upon what you want to do.  The problem with the ANSI
sequences is that you have to hardcode colors in the termcap entry.
Different users have different tastes, and some even want to use
different colors on different machines.  While it's possible for a
user to set up a private termcap, I'd rather have a standard termcap,
and then have people decide what color they want for standout, bold,
etc. by setting up definitions in .Xdefaults.  If you're using the
ANSI sequences, you'd probably set up standard colors in termcap, and
then let people make changes in .Xdefaults so that the ANSI sequence
for blue really generates red, etc.  I find that counter-intuitive.

If it's a single user machine, and the user is asleep (which is the
case you describe), it's almost completely safe (assuming you're not
doing things in the background).  update will do a sync every 30 sec.,
so 30 sec. after the last file activity things will be fine.  On a
multi-user machine, or one that runs batch jobs things get more
complex.  But on my home machine, I commonly hit reset or power it off
without any shutdown or sync.  I've never hard any trouble.  (I don't
recommend that for novices.  It works for me because (1) I have a very
simple setup.  I run no daemons other than update and getty, (2) I
don't leave things running in the background.)

I think you're seeing the difference between a simple home machine and
a multi-user system.

The more interesting question is what happens if there's a power
failure while you're actively working.  (The only relevant work would
be something that's causing files to change.)  BSD (and presumably
other systems) are careful about the order in which they do updates on
disk.  If they crash, the file system may be inconsistent, but the
kinds of inconsistency that are possible are carefully controlled, and
fsck can recover from them all (though possibly by removing files that
were in the process of being created when the power failed).  I've not
seen a clear statement about which Linux file systems (if any) do
this.

Read the ANSI standard. The C preprocessor deals with TOKENS!! It

Check the various FAQ's. I think this is mentioned in the

Subject: bug in .99p8A char device drivers? (was: bad SIMM?)
Date: 15 Apr 93 04:02:03 GMT

I've noticed a couple of posts recently about crashes that look suspiciously
like memory errors (one of them was mine :-).  Well I did some more sleuthing
and determined that it was not my SIMMs or cache card (by swapping, disabling
cache, etc).  So I turned my attention to Linux.  I can now reproduce the
error consistently in one of two ways:

[1] Log in, type a few characters, use the back arrow key or ^B to move
back into the line a bit, hit backspace---BOOM.  General protection error,
crash.  This happens with BOTH bash and tcsh.

[2] Log in, type "man mv" (or "cat" a huge file, or any command that spews
lots of data to the screen)--BOOM.  General protection error, crash.
(Note: no error if I redirect output; i.e. "man mv 2> xxx" )

This leads me to believe that there may be a problem with the keyboard handler/
character device drivers-- possibly buffers getting overrun and wiping out
other kernel data structures.

The crashes are mostly noticable in .99p8A, serial driver 3.94.  If I boot
from a .99p7 (s.d. 3.93) both [1] and [2] work fine.
I am using libc.so.4.3.3, although some of my binaries are of .99p5 vintage,
I think.  I do have the kernel compiled for memory >16Mb, although I only
have 8Mb installed.

I will keep on narrowing this down, but I'd appreciate any comments or
speculation from experienced Linuxers.  My HW configuration (not that it
matters much):  486DX, 8Mb, Micronics VL-B motherboard.

Eric Jeschke
jeschke@moose.cs.indiana.edu

ps. one other question, while I'm posting.  "ps" (ver .99p6) broke when
I upgraded from .99p7 to .99p8.  I have a proc entry in my fstab, although
I gather that "ps" does not use that, but rather "kmem".  I did a "ps -U"
after rebooting off the new kernel, but ps doesn't show anything right now.
Any hints?  Thanks!

I can compile cc1obj, but since there wasn't a real high demand, I didn't
see why the people who wanted couldn't just compile their own. Compiling
gcc will take ~20M or so, but this way you can configure everything the
way you want.

Reply-To: wb8foz@skybridge.scl.cwru.edu (David Lesher)

I've been having fun with filesystems today. ;-}

Mount and others complained about my /dev/sda6 partition. That's a
274432-block extended partition, with the efs filesystem on it. (Yes, I
*know* I should have efs2, or xiafs, but I'm waiting for the new SLS..)

Anyhow when I looked at it with fdisk, it claimed the partition was
-257394672983 or thereabouts, blocks long. But since the only file (a
BIG tar called SLS.tar) on it was safe on tape, I used fdisk to delete
the partition, and rebuilt it.  All was fine. Get out the tape, recover
the file.

Then I played around with iozone for a while. Iozone builds long
sequential files & reads them, then tells you how long it took.  Not
being one for half measures, I let it build a 200 meg test file. Gee,
the response sure slows while THAT runs ;_}

Later, guess what, more garbage.  What a bore. Unmount, efsck said
every block was not empty when it was, or the other way around. -a the
thing, and found the result was no file.  fdisk, delete, new, exit,
reboot, mkefs again, remount. Guess what? The tar file was INTACT.
Through the partition, & the mkefs. Hmm.

q1) Is the efs, or extended partitions on SCSI, noted for this
corruption on large files? Yes, I sync before booting, and brush after
every meal.

q2) How'd that file survive? 

q3) When will the all-new SLS, with me-proof filesystems, be available
in a store nearby ;-?

I also had an end-of-semester project (add symbolic links to Minix) in my 
operating class, needed to run Minix 1.5 on my PC, and looked at doing the 
same thing. 

I looked at the device drivers, and discovered that while there's a 
disk driver (kernel/bios_wini.c) that uses the BIOS only (ie, for 
SCSI disks, etc) all of the other drivers (console, serial, etc)
all talk directly to the hardware.

I figured that virtualizing Minix (either by hacking DOS emu to do the 
appropriate hardware emulation, writing BIOS using device drivers, or hacking 
Minix to run as a *normal*  Linux process) would add more time to the project 
than a virtualized Minix would save, and finished the project in eight hours
(four hours of writing code, four of debugging, mostly tracking down a 
int / off_t switch that lint / gcc would have caught) editing the Minix 
source from Linux under 'X', rebooting to try things out.

Try pdksh. I link it to /bin/sh. I have fixed two bugs in pdksh 4.8 and

Actually I was thinking the best way would not be to have new file system,
but simply to use existing tools.  One stradegy I was thinking of trying, is
having a special bit to mark files as special.  Then you could do something
like compress a directory, and replace all the files with one special file
hard linked to all the names of the files that where there.  Then with a
command like "ar" you place the compressed libraries in a random access
library.  Then when "open" sees that your special bit is set, it would
follow the instructions in the special file for restoring the uncompressed
version before trying to access it.  I don't know how efficient such a
method would be, but it seems like less work to impliment that a whole
new file system.

Yep, there is...

It's called /dev/audio (have you mknod'ed one ?)

cat your sun audio files there and they'll work just fine.

It'd be trivial to modify the splay code to use /dev/audio if you told it
you had a .au file I suppose. (One day when I've got nothing else to do...)

/dev/dsp (what splay uses) is fine for .voc and .wav files (you just have
to ignore the header at the start of wav files which comes out as a short
burst of static).

/dev/audio is for Sun audio files.


Enjoy !

Try escaping back to kermit on your local system and type:
!reset

This will run the reset script that contains the line "echo ^[c".
This will reset your screen and everything should work fine.
This also works with the problem I've encountered of everything showing
up on the last line of the VC.

You can also do, from another VC  "reset > /dev/ttyX" to the tty on which
you're having problems.

Hi I have some questions over compatibility of some devices, please dont
flame me if they have been asked before. I would prefer if any answers were
mailed to me at the email address below.

Question, will the following hardware work with Linux, and if so what drivers
do I need and where do I get them from:

1) Mitsumi CDROM with 16 bit interface (pretty sure its not SCSI)

2) ESCOM Archiv/Maynard compatible tape streamer (I think it connects to
   the floppy interface.  

3) 3Com 3c505 Ethernet card.

I do not have any of the above but I need a CDROM + Tape streamer + ethernet 
card soon.  If anybody has experience of these I would like to know.

Yes.  The Xserver and Xtoys use an incredible amount of memory, and will
definately page (going into disk wait) heavily.  The best solution would 
be to add more memory, at least 4M (you can buy used 1M SIMMs for $25 
each).  You can also reduce the amount of memory used by switching to 
X386mono, which only needs one bit for every pixel in a window, instead of 
the 8 needed by X386.  X386mono will also be faster since it's not moving 
as much data - try it.

You should automatically fsck file systems on boot up (in case your machine 
crashes from a power hit and automagically comes back up - if you write to 
a corrupt file system, you'll just make things worse) from /etc/rc, before
you start any daemons that write to the disk, and before you've mounted 
any filesystems (and root anything but readonly).

Generally, it's also a good idea to reboot if there were any problems with 
the fsck on /.

When I am in Linux, how do I copy the file from the

Sometimes under kermit the character set gets screwed up, I've never
seen this under linux, but under mskermit, the following fixes it

^\C <escape back to kermit>
set term char trans 

this sets the character set to transparent, you could also use ascii

If getting more memory is totally out of the question, may I suggest
changing the swapfile into a partition.  I know that re-fdisking is a
pain, but swapping to a partition is *noticeably* faster than swapping
to a file, and it can make a sluggish X11 seem almost usable.  Also, as
has already been recommended, the mono-X11 is much less memory-hungry
than the colour version, and would also help the problem. 

Note that using a swapfile is easy and painless, but it's really meant
only for those cases where you don't really need to dip into swap all
the time (when you have enough memory for most things, but need the
swapfile for those occasional times when you compile big files while
running X at the same time etc).  If you are serious about swapping, try
to do it using a swap partition.

I think LILO makes a copy of the boot record. 
Try finding that copy on your disk ( has MSDOS5.0 in the beginning, if 
you used version 5.0).

Had to do find it myself because i wrote 512 bytes onto the first bytes 
my HD, you know the master boot record, partition table etc.
(Norton utilities found it, copied it and my computer is alive).

I think this proves how stupid Dos is and how careful you have to be
when playing with power (LINUX).

No, Linux just looks like it is hung when it runs out of memory.  This
has been kicked around many times in this newsgroup - lots of talk
about elaborate ways to avoid out of memory hangs but no really good
solution, IMHO.  

Give yourself 32 MB of swap and go to bed.  You will have tiff in the

If the root filesystem is mounted readonly, how can fsck write back

Sounds like you forgot to add a "-lm" to the end of your gcc (or ld,
if you run that directly) command -line.  This tells the linker to
make use of the math library, where most of the <math.h> functions
live.

Apparently whoever built the less that is distributed with SLS

[]Hello,
[]
[]this is probably a FAQ:
[]
[]I have heard from different sources, that an ISA board
[]in an EISA PC slows down the access to the remaining EISA boards.
[]
[]An article in an old issue of the german 'CT magazine states

[]But they did not tell what "address space" means here.
[]
[]Any comments?
[]
===========================
[]From: Sam Shim <shim@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
[]
[]   It's not true.  ISA boards have no effect on the EISA boards.  No effect
[]whatsoever.  That's a rumor that always seems to crop up every once in a
[]while.
[]
[]-Sam-
[]
===========================
[]From: mccall@mksol.dseg.ti.com (fred j mccall 575-3539)
[]
[]From what I understand, this simply doesn't happen on a properly
[]implemented EISA bus.  The bus will run at 8.33 MHz with a transfer
[]every clock.  This seems to imply that even ISA boards will run twice
[]as fast as they do in an ISA-bus machine (although I'm not sure about
[]that bit).  Anyway, there is no reason for the EISA bus to slow down
[]for ISA cards.  And it doesn't.
[]
===========================
[]From: aron@taos.ced.berkeley.edu (aron bonar)
[]
[]I thought that the only difference was the size of the data path...ie 16 bit for ISA and
[]32 bit for EISA.  The bus clock speed is the same (more or less) for both so if you stick an
[]ISA card in an EISA slot then the slot only transfers over a 16 bit path and not a 32 bit one.
[]
[]So..I guess you could say that if you put an ISA card in an EISA slot then your system is slower
[]than it could be.  But then again you knew that.

I am still not certain about this topic.

Watching my libm.a in /usr/lib shows me, there is a sin in

The strange about this ist, that he doesn't complain abount

One solution was to change the specs file in /usr/lib/gcc-lib.......
adding a '-l m' to each entry in the default libs line.
Well - as i think this is not the very best solution.

  You do realize that quotas are on a "per filesystem" basis? You might
have a quota on /tmp, and that would be different from the quota on the
home filesystem, etc. That's not remotely a bug, it's the way it was
intended to work.

  And the reason for quotas is to protect the system, not to punish the
user from trying to use resources to get something done... I could see
having a soft limit on /tmp of about 100b (for shell history), and a
hard limit of 50MB, with a time limit of 1hr or so. That lets people get
enough disk to do image processing, and still encourages them to remove
files as soon as they are done.

  Of course I usually run a daemon which encourages /tmp cleanliness,
too.

In the default configuration, yes.  I think the way I encode the

something like that, but you should be able to get more than 8 by just

  A typical [34]86 actually draws about 150w from the mains. 150w * 24hr

No, that's not the problem.  Linux itself isn't a GNU project, nor are
many of the contributers members of the FSF.  The sticky part comes
when you realize that Linux doesn't really *do* much without the help
of tools like gcc, and without the help and encouragement of the FSF
these tools might not have ever been ported to Linux in the first
place.  FSF is boycotting apple, so they will do nothing to help the
developers put the system together; nor will they support the system
if (or when) it ever runs [at least as I understand it].

>BUT, having said that, I do believe that the FREE OS / FREE Software
>thing from GNU will have to be clarified....

Why don't you just read the FSF texts on the matter.  Read the
CopyLeft, the GNU Manefesto, or the many GNU mail lists.

I stand corrected on this issue, of *course* Macintrashes are real
computers, there are working UNIX ports to them! (:P) The question is:
Is it really worth anyone's time to port Linux over to them knowing
that
        1. The Linux kernel depends on a 386 protected mode architecture.
           Meaning, of course, that binary compatibility is out of the
           question, and that "porting software to Linux" would mean
           having to work on two completely different architectures.
           (Part of the reason for Linux's success to date is that
           all 386 and 486 systems at least share the same architecture.)
           To put it in simpler terms, a Linux port to the Macintrash
           *wouldn't be Linux*.

        2. FSF wants nothing to do with the project.  This means that there
           won't be any support for the compilers, and none for the
           tools compiled with them.  Macintrash Linux users might
           have to *ghasp* write their own patches to software or deal
           solely in precompiled packages (something else FSF isn't
           very fond of).

Having said this, we get to the issue of what Macintrash users want or
need.  Far be it from me to criticize someone for buying a tool that
works perfectly for their particular use, but I fail to see reason in
trying to make a Macintrash something that it's not.  Macintrashes
*have* a stable, multitasking operating system and a reasonable
selection of software and tools.  You don't have to option to get the
OS unbundled as you do in MS-DOGland, nor could you really get far
without commercial software packages.  

The few people I know that bought Macintrashes for personal use (most
have used Macintrashes at work, and consequently go to the computer
store looking for an alternative), the machines were purchaced for
homework (word processing) or business (spreadsheets, et al.) and
wouldn't know the difference between UNIX and VM/CMS if their lives
depended on it.  If the machine was bought for business, its because
Macintrashes are a plug-and-play system.  They're handy for plunking
down on someone's desk with minimal configuration and getting the work
done.

Perhaps I'm missing something important here, but I fail to see where
something like Linux would fit into such an environment.  If
Macintrashes are bought for their stability, compactness, and ease of
use ... it seems to me that most Mac users would run in the opposite
direction if confronted with a monster like UNIX.  I realize there are
a handful of Macs that run UNIX, but the market is tiny and is already
saturated with commercial offerings.

Finally, I see no particular advantages in running Linux on your home
Macintrash rather than purchasing a power PC with the expandibility,
compatibility, and portability issues already dealt with.  Computer
Shopper this month is selling complete 386SX/16 systems (the minimum
configuration) for under $500 and complete 486DX2/66 systems (top of
the line) for under $2500.  If you order your machine UPS Red today
and copy the SLS distribution off someone elses disks or your Internet
account tonight before you go home from work you could have a working,
stable, complete, recognised, supported, *FREE* UNIX look-alike
workstation by Wednesday (complete with 3 button mouse and *color*
display!).

Because unices use a write back cache to maximize performance - 
when you have multiple programs accessing multiple files, you 
want to reorder the writes to minimize head movement, without 
blocking any of the processes unecessarily.

Every power cycle may put as much as 50 hours worth of wear on the hard disk,
and your wife wouldn't like it if it broke and you had to spend hundreds of

What partition _exactly_ was it you wanted to mount ?
I got a similar problem, but after I looked at the partition table I
found I've tried to mount an unused partition entry ...

So, have a look at the partition table ( with 'fdisk' and give 'em a 
'p' for 'print partition table'). It'll tell you, which partition you
should mount. 
Sorry, try fdisk /dev/xxx where xxx is the name of the HD ( _without_

(i.e.  Three copies of the window manager, mouse, etc...)  I am using
a Western Digital Paradise windows acc. card with 1 MB and my monitor is

Subject: Grrr!  This networking is driving me nuts!

As the title suggests, I'm having a few networking problems.  Up until
recently, I've had no problems at all running the pre-ALPHA SLIP code
with my 0.99.4 kernel with libc.so.4.3.2;  all the net config files
are in the right place, and they all seem to have the right things in
them.

`Fine!' you might say, `So what's the problem?.  Well, I'll tell you.

I recently set up another linux box with a similar network
configuration (0.99.7A, libc.so.4.3.3, with a different hostname & IP
address), and connected the two together using a couple of WD80x3
clones and some thinnet cable.  And although both kernels can see both
cards, I can't for the life of me make them talk.  I get plenty of
`network is unreachable' errors, but it seems to me that the code
isn't actually talking to the ethernet cards (at least, no lights
flash!).  And yes, I've checked the network terminations etc.

If someone out there has overcome what seems to me to be a very basic and
fundamental configuration problem of some description, I'd be
extremely grateful to hear from you - preferably by mail, although I
may well send an account of my experiences to the maintainer of the
net-FAQ if it's something which isn't in there.

Thanks very much (in advance),

        but, isn't that what the ulimit is for?  to control the size of 
the file that a user creates?  if that were the case, then why not
hhave the 'hard limit' be that a user cannot create a file, period,
if they have reached it, and have the ulimit being there to keep them
from just continually running.  Most ulimit's I've seen are defaulted
to about 2Meg or so.  Understandably, if their hard limit is 1Meg,
then creating a 2Meg file starting at their .5Meg level would allow
them to pass their hard limit by 1.5Meg, but in that case, why would
their ulimit be larger then their hard limit?

just a thought...

I am certainly not a linux or unix wiz, but why not handle a quota exceed

A plea for peace...
      ENOUGH TRASHING THE MACINTOSH!!!  I'm the first to admit that the
Macintosh is NOT the perfect computer, but neither is any other
computer.   Long, long, long ago in my computing infancy I encouraged my
parents to buy a macintosh SE.  I have never regretted the decision. 
It is no longer the greatest computer in the world, but MY DAD IS MAKING
ADVERTISMENTS ON IT  *W*I*T*H*O*U*T* *M*Y* *H*E*L*P!!!!!!!!!   This is a
man who needed a command sheet to load telix on the much lamented family
XT.  That alone is enough to make me a believer.
      I use a pc.  I loath windows, particularly after laboring for days
to make it run, and failing.  However, apart from windows, and bill
gates, and most anything to do with microsoft or big blue, being the
embodyment of evil, there are no absolute truths, and like in religion,
one persons god is anothers devil.  You and your ilk are like
fundamentalists, imposing your own strict and repressive idealogy on e
innocent people who were living quite hapily until you started making a
stink.
      To summarize: stick your elitest ideas in the same bodily orifice
where the suits have their heads firmly placed, and send flames to
/dev/null.

This looks like the original logo posted by James Callinson.  I did a
smaller hand-crafted version.  If this logo is to be used, I would push
for using my version (keeping attribution for the original artist --
my part was mostly technical).

This is not just so that I can blow my own trumpet (or nose), but for
the following reasons:

 o people have reported problem with using the 'setcolor' operator -- I use
   'setrgbcolor'.
 o the bounding box above is rubbish -- this makes inclusion in documents
   difficult.
 o it is too large -- it is almost 53k -- mine is less than 1k (just :-).
 o my version should be easily updatable to different releases, even by a
   novice.

My own personal feeling is that I quite like this logo, I think it would
look snazzy on a CD.  However, I feel the final choice must lie with
Linus -- it is his OS.

Anyway, here is my version, which has been available on tsx-11 for since
0.97.  This is marginally updated -- it is for "Linux 1.0" :-)

> 2Mb is the absolute minimum you need

BZZT wrong. If you include only the things you really need - ie no scsi,
no tcp/ip, and only minix fs you can run some things in 1MB. If you trim
the kernel page tables and file buffers down you can combine this with
a shared lib init and getty and run many things. 
I used a 1Mb 386 like this for a while to play games and edit documents.
Granted its no good for compiling (hello world took 4  minutes).

It's all a matter of what you use it for. The killer with linux is the 
applications - notably some of the Gnu stuff and X. If someone ported
something like bcc386 from minix I'd expect a 1Mb machine wouldn't be
too bad for compiling either.

Yes they do is the quick answer. Only it's not the cards that can cause
problems, its the bus access times. The problem is that while your EISA
cards are working away chatting to the cpu everything is great. An ISA
card still behaves like an ISA card so anything doing a lot of ISA bus
cycles reduces your PC to ISA speed for that time. The common big culprit
is DMA based ethernet cards. If you are receving a lot of broadcast or
normal packets you can spend a lot of the time waiting for the ISA bus
operations. 
You never get worse than ISA, but an ISA card in an EISA machine is as much
a slowdown and problem as an ISA card in an ISA machine. 

Unless you have a lot of heavy traffic to ISA cards forget it, even if you
do its not that desperate a problem.

I agree, BSD quotas are implemented in this way, a hard limit stops any further

Mount with no file system type given will attempt to mount the file system
as the default type - older Linux kernels used Minix, newer kernels
may use something different.

Do mount -t ext /dev/hda2 /new .

Also, you *don't* want to be using the ext file system,
it's painfully slow because it uses free lists instead of 
bitmaps, and it has dumb allocation routines.

Instead, use the ext2 filesystem (the code is in recent 
Linux kernels, the programs are available from tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/alpha/
ext2 or some other intuitive directory).  It uses bitmaps to track free blocks,
has a clean flag, replicated super blocks for better reliability, saner 
block allocation routines that will help to prevent fragmentation and that 
keep inodes close to their files and indirect blocks, etc.

Much better.

Also, you'll need swap space, since you don't want to swap to a file 
because of performance reasons, you should make a separate swap partition.

Mount whatever you're copying to on new, as root do 

(cd /; tar cf - `echo * | sed s/new//g` ) | (cd /new; tar xfp -)

This will install symlinks and device files correctly on the new 
partition, but hard-linked files will end up with multiple files on the 
destination.

The following shell script should correct the problem with multiple copies
of hardlinked files (albeit a bit inefficiently) : 

#!/bin/sh
src=/
dest=/new

current_inode=0
find . -xdev -type f -a -links +1 | xargs ls -i | sort -n | (
  while read input; do
    inode=`echo $input | awk '{print $1}'`
    file=`echo $input | awk '{print $2}' | sed "s,^./,,g" `
    if [ $inode -ne $current_inode ]; then
      current_inode=$inode
      link_to=$file
    else
      rm ${dest}/$file
      ln ${dest}/$link_to ${dest}/$file
    fi
  done
)

Hello All!

I would like pros & cons of doing the following:

Installing Linux in place of a SCO XENIX 386 System V system, which runs
on a Tandy 386 computer, and uses Tandy DT-100 terminals(non graphic).

Goal would be to:

Get a UNIX type system running in place of the SCO system, more std.
than SCO
Use the existing software, Wordperfect for Unix & some Excaliber (PD
software)
Add IBM-PC 386SX+ type computer systems with VGA graphics to system
Use DOS based programs on terminals & PC's

At present the people who use this system have no knowledge on how to
use the SCO system, other than the software installed.

If this is a good idea or not.

Date: Tue, 13 Apr 1993 16:35:27 -0800

...which I know I've seen the answers to, but I can't find them now. 

1) When I mount a DOS partition, it's mounted as: 

-rwx--x--x 

Which means root can get to it, but nobody else can.  I'd like to be
able 
to mount it 755 so other people can read from it, but not write to it. 
I know this has something to do with permissions on the mount executable

and setuid or something like that, but I can't figure it out.  I can 
chmod 755 /dos the mount point, but that only holds for the first 
directory under it, then everything is non-write-non-read again. 

2) I've got Citadel/UX running just fine under Linux (Which, BTW, can be

ftp'd from quartz.rutgers.edu, or F'req from 1:377/42 as CIT314.ZIP) 
which means I now have to get getty running on my serial port with the 
modem attached.  I've got this done ok, but now about every 10 minutes
or 
so I get a message saying "c7 respawning too fast, shutting down for 5 
minutes" or somesuch.  I know I've seen an answer to this one, too, but

don't remember what it was. 

Responses via E-Mail to dglidden@bix.com please, since I can't keep up 
with the traffic here.

I have had some serious problems porting some code to flex - mostly due
to the code being very poor.

The code assumed that lex copied matched strings to a buffer, and did
things like edit the buffer in situ, use yyless to insert extra
characters into the stream, and all sorts of nasties.

For gruesome things like this, I would really appreciate the
availability of a more compatible lex package, though where it worked, I
would use flex - it's so much faster.

   - then snaps back to the login

I've had the same problem, had to switch back to 0.99.7 to run xdm.

It seems that xinit runs .xinitrc, but the user's clients aren't
allowed to connect to the server.  Putting xhost + in your Xstartup
disables the access control, so your clients (and anybody else's for that
matter) can connect, but I wouldn't recommend this on a network machine.

And a related question: has anybody gotten MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1
authentication to work?  It doesn't seem to work (with network connections,
That is), regardless of the kernel version.  Doesn't the server support it?
It seems to accept the -auth option, since xdm manages to start the server.

If authentication doesn't work, why are local clients allowed to connect to
the server when using 0.99.7 or older versions of the kernel?  Also, why
did the kernel upgrade change things?

Finally, I tried to recompile xdm and noticed some header files missing:
Where are linux/if.h, linux/if_arp.h and linux/if_route.h, which are
supposed to be included by the respective files in /usr/include/net?

Many questions, few answers...

Dear Netters

        Now I find what caused the following error message:

> MINIX-fsmagic mathc failed
> [MS-DOS FS Rel.alpha.8, FAT 16, check=n, conv=b, uid=0, gid=0, umask=000]

If I format the 1.2MB floppies with PCTOOLS R3.4 , the problem is gone.
But if I format floppies with the FORMAT utility of MS-DOS 5.0 , the same error
message will appear. It seems that Linux 0.99pl6 can't be installed from the
floppies with FAT-16 made by DOS-format utility, while it can get alone well 
with the DOS FAT-12 created by PCTOOLS.

But the other problem occured while installing from a1.test remains unsolved. 
Anyway, thanks to those who offered me opinions to solve my previous 
question. :-)

Sincerely

On my hard disk, the fifth logical drive in the extended partition 
is available to install Linux.  However, this is equivalent to "hda9"
(according to FAQ #50), and the default system only has "hda1" to "hda8".

This is a large disk (660meg), and it's inconvenient to move everything
around.  Is there a way to add a device "hda9"?

I have diskettes a1 and a2 in Linux format, via rawrite.
The others are DOS format awaiting installation.

I'm having a bit of trouble getting my linux box to send print jobs to
remote printers. As well, remote machines cannot successfully send
print jobs to my linux machine.

At one point, I was able to send remote jobs to my linux machine, but
for some reason, things stopped working. Local printing does work
though - while logged into my linux machine I can print to the local
printer on my linux machine without problems.

Here's how things look when I try to print from my linux machine to

way, way out of my budget....  believe me, that's the first thing I

computer up for a few seconds).  when I get a job again, that's high on
the list (along with more hard disk, more memory, etc.).

well first off, use gell-cells instead of car batteries---they're much
safer (acid from the car batteries will destroy anything it touches)....
I'm not sure what this does to the cost, but there's no way I'd use car
batteries for any kind of indoor power supply.  this is also why most
Amateur Radio ops I've talked to who want to go portable (e.g., hiking
trip, etc.) with their rigs carry gell-cells instead of car batteries.  :-)

actually, the way UPSs normally work is more along the same lines as the
battery in a telephone central office (switching center).  basically, the
entire phone system (including your telephone, provided it isn't one of
the ones, such as cordless phones, that wants external AC power) runs off
of the battery the whole time, whether external power is there or not.
the external power, when it exists, is used to keep the battery charged.
(in the case of the telco, there are *MASSIVE* generators to take over
the charging of the battery when power failure is sustained.)

UPS systems for computers (and other devices, too, of course) work the
same way.  the computer/whatever runs off of the battery, and the AC power
keeps the battery charged.

this, btw, is why there isn't a hit when the power fails---the computer
never sees a change in its power source, because there isn't a change.
I've seen demos of some UPSs where you see a scope showing the output
voltage level at the time of the power failure, and it's perfectly clean,
w/ no fluctuation at all in voltage or phase....rock solid.  same for
when the power came back---no change.  of course, this was also a very
high-end UPS system, too...not sure what the cheaper ones would look like
in that same demo.

anyways, this is more than a bit off the subject of this group, but I'm
not sure where to re-direct followups on this one...especially since it'd
almost certainly be a group I have no access to.  :-(

see my other reply....  that was the first thing that came to mind.  the
second thing that came to mind was my budget (and the lack thereof).  when
you're in what some choose to call a career transition stage (i.e., you
don't have a job), money isn't quite as easy to come by.  actually, I've
yet to see a UPS that I could have afforded even before getting laid off.

Another _very fast_ solution is to swap to a partition on an other disk.
With linux fs on one disk and swap partition on another disk, head movement
is much less and X with 4MB is nearly as usable as with 8MB.
I've installed linux on my friends pc using on HD for DOS and Linux swap
and the other for linux fs, and had really been impressed.

Although if you do this, you'll have to redefine MAX_SWAPFILES in free.c
from the ps-0.99.6 source.  Would the procps version of free have to change
at all?

Subject: chsh stopped working after kernel & lib upgrade
Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 16:19:12 GMT

Just a minor problem.  The "chsh" program stopped working recently
during the upgrade process (I use this program so little that I can't
even tell at what version of the kernel and library it stopped working).  
Currently, my setup is Linux 0.99.8 and libc 4.3.3.  The /etc/passwd
and the /usr/bin/chsh both belong to root, and the modes are 0755 and
4755, respectively.  The point is, chsh doesn't work, even when I am
logged in as root.  So the permissions cannot be the problem (and they
are correct anyway, I think).  When I execute chsh, it lists all the
shells from the file /etc/shells.  But when I actually choose a shell
from the list by its number, it just says "/bin/ksh not found" (if that
was the shell chosen) and redisplays the list.  The only thing I can do
is to press Ctrl-C to break out of the loop.  This happens with both the
chsh that came with hlu's basedisk and Rik Faith's utila package, by
the way.  Does anybody have an explanation?  Thanks in advance.

This works for me (SLS 1.0 with 0.99.6 kernel):
find lpr, lpd, lpc and lprm (some appear in 2 directories):
chown root lpr lprm lpd lpc
chmod 4755 lpr lprm lpd lpc
chmod 0660 /usr/spool/lp1
chown daemon.daemon /usr/spool/lp1

And make sure you start lpd somewhere (/etc/rc.local is a nice place).

Since i had an old Hercules screen and card lying around i thought i'd patch the
linux kernel to handle two moniters. It worked and was all very nice and clever.
One moniter (the VGA one) is Virtual Consoles 1-4 the the Herc is 5-8, great i
thought.
        Snag is, i don't use text mode much i use X. But when you start X all the
virtual consoles disappear ( i knew this anyway). This makes my second moniter
useless.
        Is their anyway i can either; run X on  both screens, or run X  on the
VGA one and still use the hercules one for text???

        Any ideas anyone?

Setup: 486sx, 25Mhz, 8Mb RAM, generic VGA board, Trident8900C card, Hercules
moniter, and an 8-bit Hercules card which must be a decade old if its a day.

Cheers, Stu.

Nice, assuming you use sh or bash.  Use tcsh users would have to use:

set command = "\
while ( 1 == 1 ) \
  set x = "\"\$\<\"" \
  echo "\"\$x:q\"" \
end \
"
(echo -n "";eval $command:q) < file >> output_file

This would work under tcsh, but not csh.  (I suspect a csh user would
have no recourse!)

Anyways, I think the point of these tricks is that they work, but are
not obvious exspecially to a person who is panicing because nothing 
works!  Anyways now that sash is available, this is really a mute point.

I am curious about one thing. Is it possible to use a logical
disk of MS-DOS partition for LINUX. I would like to have my 
MS-DOS logical drive converted to 2efs file system. This way I
can save a partition or two for other operating system. Has 
anyone had any experience with this? Should/Could I do it? I guess
if this is possible I could do the same thing with swap too.

You must mount from a Linux NFS server with rsize and wsize equal to 1024.
Also, you should definitely use version 1.2 or the newest version 1.5 of
the NFS server.

Subject: Compressed filesystems
Date: 15 Apr 1993 11:16:43 -0500

This is a thought which just came to me. I don't know whether it's
been proposed before. I've noticed the main concern with 'compressed'
filesystems is demand-paging. It would seem to me that a good solution
to this concern is to compress files in 4k blocks (I think linux pages
in 4k blocks. My entire knowledge of linux specifics comes from this
group) These compressed blocks could then be fit into a number of
smaller-sized (1k or 512 byte) physical blocks.
This would be slightly complicated because while physical disk-usage
would be kept track of on a 1K/512 level, the files would be kept
track of (what English skills) on a 4k level. Each I-node then would
give information on a 4k chunk of a file and would possibly show: 
1: the physical block to start on
2: the number of contiguous physical blocks this chunk is stored on
3: whether or not this chunk is compressed
4: number of bytes in the un-compressed chunk. This would be both for
the last chunk of a file, and possibly for pages of executibles so
that padding won't be un-nessisarily compressed and stored.
5: possibly a checksum to ensure data integrity

Some concerns about this method:

Since pieces must be stored in nunbers of contiguous (is that the
right word?) physical blocks, fragmentation may become a problem. I.e.
freed sections near the front of a partition will be too small to hold
larger compressed chunks so they must be moved to the end. (This was a
concern of mine with an idea someone posted earlier about compressing
the 'physical' blocks on a disk) But I don't know much in this area,
so that may not be a problem.

Speed of access. This would only be a problem depending on what is
stored under the filesystem. If it is text/source files. Then speed
would not be a major concern. Even if it is exicutibles, as long as
the time taken to un-compress the chunks won't have a major impact on
preformance, it still won't be a big concern. Obviously, you wouldn't
want to put a swap file in this kind of filesystem :-) (Unless having
a larger swap space is a much larger concern than the large
performance loss that would be incured)

Any comments? Any information/assumptions I have incorect that would
make this infeasible?

        uses a combination and "mixes" the power of both (to prevent
        a failure in either the inverter or switch over from killing
        your system).
        
        Small UPS (esp. standby variants) are fairly cheap.  About
        US$150, I think.  They won't stay up for long, nor will they
        keep your monitor and printer going as well.  But if all you
        really need is to shutdown the system, 5 minutes is enough
        time.
        
        Locally, we have more problems with "power flickers" than
        "power failures."  Having a baby unit to keep the system
        running over those times helps a lot.

Date: 15 Apr 93 13:10:14 EST


I am using latest SLS package (from tsx-11). If I am type as root 'df'
a message appears: 

  df: cannot read table of mounted file systems

what is this table ? where it should be located ? Also, when I try 'mount'
without options there is no response, it should print mounted file systems.
But there is no ather problem with mount I can found, exept worning:

  EXT2-fs warning: mounting non valid file system

when root f.s. is  mounted during boot-up. I checked /dev/hda1 (my root f.s)
with e2fsk, it seems to be no errors. 

Any ideas what is going on ? Any clues ?

Well, I had Linux 0.99pl2 running on a 486DX2-66 with SiS chipset for a
while.  But, when I added my Elite 16T ethernet card, X start locking up
randomly when painting menus or windows.  The problem was "solved" by
relocating my cards within my machine.  Then, on another SiS board with
the similar hardware and software, the same problem occurred, and swapping
cards around didn't solve the problem (at least not with the combinations
that I've tried).  Finally, I returned both motherboards for ones with
UMC chipsets.  No problem ever since.

Although I can't prove it, it appears that the SiS chipset is marginal
at best for Linux.

Hi,

I just attempted to compile gnuplot 3.2, from tsx-11:/pub/linux/sources/

Make sure that you are using libc.4.3.3. There is a bug in earlier
libraries that can cause memory to be eaten under rare circumstances.
Upgrade to the new library and see if your problem goes away.

You can change it to anything you like. If you want to logout only by
double-clicking the middle mouse button, put the following in your

I think there is the Problem. I WAS using the 14F on my system and
ext-fs (NOT ext-2-fs). After Linux 0.99pl7 there is a new driver for the
14F which is supposed to be faster.IT IS VERY FAST (in screwing up my
filesystem). I could easily repoduce the problem with the following
command:

cd /usr ; for i in * ; do (tar cf ${i}.tar ${i} ; rm ${i}.tar) & ; done

It starts running and after few minutes I get lots of error messages and
finally the system crashes. when trying to fix the filesystem i also get
so much errors that there is NO CHANCE to fix it. Iam not sure if there
really is to blame the disk-driver or the controller. I already twice
sent a problem-description to c.o.l.but it either did not get out or
nobody took any notice of it. Anyhow, I am using at the moment a
friend's AHA1542B and I ordered a new AHA1542C. With the AHA1542B I have
no problems at all, hopefully my new AHA1542C will behave the same.

More memory is definately better. 

However, if you are stuck with only 4M : 

- Use the monochrome server instead, mono images require 12.5% 
        of the memory that color images take.

- Pare down the kernel to more workable size by compiling out the 
        features you don't use - ie TCP/IP, SCSI, etc.

- Use a swap partition instead of a swap file, it's noticeably
        faster.

Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 20:36:34 GMT

First question: In /usr/include, some of the header files refer to
other header files in a linux directory.  These header files, such as
time.h, do not exist in the linux directory off of /usr/include, nor
are they in /usr/src/linux/include/linux (or whatever that other
directory is)  Can someone tell me where to get these header files,
please?

Second question: When trying to connect my XT to my linux box through
a null modem, I've managed to get getty to send the issue file and the
login prompt, but as soon as I type in a log in name, it hangs.  Using
ps, I can see that getty has called login, but I don't get the
password prompt, and after 5 minutes it drops back to getty and the
issue file and login prompt.  The (hopefully) relevant line in my
inittab is: 

c5:5:respawn getty 9600 ttyS1      

(From memory, but it should be right)

If anyone can help me with either of these problems, please email me

  Being a True Blue Aussie, I'm rather fond of the platypus. However, seeing as
  the Linux logo should have a Finnish flavour, this seems inappropriate.
  Of course, an alternative is to have an International flavour logo.

This behaviour may be related to NFS.  I have created anon privleged
user with home directory on the local disk and was able to log in.
All the other users on the system have directories mounted via NFS.

I will apply the patch that came out for the vm86 problem to see
if it is the problem here.

So long as you check the filesystems at boot time you should be fine even
if the machine goes off at the wrong moment. Ok you might lose a few blocks
that were being written at the time but nothing serious. I'd think a cron
job to do a halt at 30 minutes before the timeswitch would be fine. Also
remember that even if the uucp overruns under Linux the halt by cron
will occur happily mid phone call.(I do hope your modem drops when that
happens 8-))

I have warned you in c.o.l. Please dig out my old article. I may miss
something here.

1. Get Rick Sladkey's mount 0.99.6. It is in mount-0.99.6.tar.Z and
   utile-1.4.src.tar.z from sunsite or tsx-11.
2. Remove any
        rdev > /dev/mtab
   from /etc/rc.
3. List / partition in /etc/fstab.
4. Add "mount -av" in /etc/rc or somewhere like that.
5. Always provide a fs name in /etc/fstab.


After rebooting, you will be fine.

Subject: Re: Automated Linux PowerDown
Date: 15 Apr 1993 18:02:40 GMT


A couple of things...

1) Monitors consume the lions share of power on a system by far more than any
other peripheral, and *much* more than the CPU.

2) If you figure that much money, you are probably using the power rating of
the CPU.  It is important  to realize that you probably rarely if ever even 
come close to the power rating of the power supply in your CPU unit.  (Power
ratings are typically 100-150 watts -- actual consumption is probably less 
than 20 watts if you turn off the monitor)

Net result: ALWAYS turn the MONITOR off!  They cost lots to keep turned on.
                        Almost never turn the CPU off.  There is additional strain on
                        the system hardware, and on the filesystems when you do that.

Incidentally, the EECS department here at UC Berkeley has used that method
to DRASTICALLY reduce their power consumption.  Turning the monitors off when
not in use SAVES BIG BUCKS!

Subject: Re: SLIP for linux?
Date: 15 Apr 93 17:06:23 GMT

Is anyone aware of a product for Linux that works similar to SLIP, but doesn't
require SLIP?  SLIP had some security holes that are incompatible with our
corporate police.  I am aware of term, but I believe that only works with X and
I can`t run X yet.  Is there anything else that will let me have multiple connections
to a Unix system, that doesn't require that I have su permission on the Unix system?
Has anyone heard of a version of UW for Linux?  UW is a package that was written
for the Mac and ported to MSDOS, then ported to Windows, but I'm not  aware of
a Linux port.

Thanks..
Jim.

Subject: Cache controller - which unix fs ?
Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 12:59:17 GMT


I got a cache controller (longshine ? longxxxx ?) for the Ide-Hd.  In
his setup it is possible to configure an optimization based on the OS,
I think in truth it's file-system based. There are several choices:

dos
windows
os2
novell
sco xenix
sco unix
interactive unix
at&t unix

Anyone knows about which so has the most similar file system to linux?
Actually I'm using a little bit of the minix fs and much more the
ext(2)-fs, which is not yet stable...so what should I select (and why
since the fs will change..) ?

Please if anyone knows something about it mail to
hman@paola.dei.unipd.it since we've got several trouble with our
newsserver... we're still waiting for the news of about 2 weeks ago :-(


Thanks

WRONG!  I just bought an APC 400 UPS for my box.  It explicitly states that
it only conditions the power except in the event of a power failure.  It then
*switches* to the batteries and provides a reduced amplitude modified sine
wave for the computer power supply.

I was under the same impression you stated above until I spoke with a
representative from the *manufacturer*.  He stated that the life of the
batteries used in such a manner is far too short for small scale
(i.e. PC) use.  For the larger systems you mentioned, I would guess
that they have a maintenance cycle in which they disconnect one or more
cells from the battery array to replace them.

Nope, it's based on the umask at the time of the mount call.  Instead 
of a plan mount, do

umask 22
mount /dos 
 
or whatever.  For this reason, in my /etc/rc file I have 

umask 22
mount -a
umask 0

instead of just a mount -a.

Yup.  The susption was correct.  It was related to the access()

Right... every quota system I have ever seen truncates the file so that

Subject: Re: xvt for Linux???
Date: 15 Apr 93 14:30:50

I have ported xvt to linux, but I make a bunch of changes along the
way, so you may or may not be interested. Here's a summary of the
changes:

Just to port xvt:
Only a few minor mods:
1. DON'T compile using optimization. In the Makefile, remove -O 2 from
   cflags.
2. there is one instance of the constant FNDELAY which should be
   changed to O_NDELAY.
3. One of the include file names, I think <termio.h> needs to be
   changed to <termios.h>. The error will become obvious when you
   compile.
The sources can be found on ftp.uu.net.
This leaves the bug that if, in one terminal window, you type
xvt<ret>, then cntrl-z, then bg, it croaks. The problem is that Linux
returns an error if a select() call is interrupted, but sunos doesn't.

My modifications:
1. Stripped out debugging sub-routines to make the code smaller.
2. Cleaned up some code to make it a bit more compact, and a little
   easier to follow.
3. Removed support for some fairly useless vt-100 commands, like the
   one that fills your screen with capital E's/
4. Added partial support for the graphics character sets (enough to
   run all of my applications), which is a fair amount, but not all
   graphics character commands.
5. Forced the scroll-bar to always show. Also modified the appearance
   of the scrollbar (I like it better).
6. removed support for getting default info from the .Xresources
   files, since I don't use these, and find it annoying to have to
   look in 29 different config files all over the system to find out
   why I' getting purple text, or something.
7. Added support for more of the function keys. The original xvt
  didn't respond to any of F1-F20, or most of the home, pg up, etc
keys.

Anyway, after doing all that, the final executable has a text size of
about 41 Kbytes, and data size of 8 kbytes, about 40% smaller than
stock xvt. If one xvt is used instead of 1 xterm, it saves 368 Kbytes
of memory. I didn't check into saving on subsequent instances.

If you want my source code, I will email it to you.

I don't know if anyone has asked this before, so please be gentle!  I can't
get on as much to read the news....

So the question:   How the hell can you get xtoolplaces to compile?  I
notice in the new release of Xview xtoolplaces has been compiled....I've
even contacted the author and he doesn't know why it won't compile for me.


The problem is with the Xfree() function.  If I weren't at the school, I'd
dump the entire compile error list to the net but...
...anyway, the compiler is complaining about the wrong 'type' argument for
Xfree().

Any help would greatly be appreciated (e-mail please!) as this has been
bugging me for months!

Hello!

     I am experiencing a strange lockup about once or twice a day while running
X-windows (I am running the tvtwm window manager).  What happens is that 
intermittantly my screen will just *poof* and appear that it lost all
horizontal hold.  It doesn't flicker or anything but rather just freezes.
The screen has slanted stripes, which are rather wide, running down it.
Sometimes, more often than not, I can still telnet into my system so it's 
not dead (sometimes it is dead though).  I've tried killing the X-server
and miscellaneous other stuff, but only a reboot truely fixes the problem.
I'm running on a DEC 466D2LP (a 486/66) and have the S3 chip and a local bus.
I also have 24 megs ram and a 11meg swap partition on a 245 meg HD.  I'm
running the XS3-0.4.4 server.  I am very impressed with linux and will quite
willing live with this minor inconvenience but am hoping some of the gurus

One other minor point, in addition to restrictions on the material that may
be broadcast over amateur radio, one must also have a valid amateur license.  I don`t
know what is happening in Canada these days, but the FCC is levying some pretty large
fines for relatively minor infractions down here.

I don't want to discourage you from using packet radio, just be sure you are legal.

After I tried all the combination to install Logitech S9 Bus Mouse,
it works now.

First of all, IRQ must be set to 5.
Secondly, in Xconfig,
either
        MouseSystems    "/dev/bmouselogitec"
or
        BusMouse        "/dev/bmouselogitec"
must be set as well.

I got the new xview stuff, nice work kenneth

BUT xtoolplaces as set up by the install program

a) writes a 0k file .openwin-init if I run it using the "owplaces"
   script provided, which is fine and dandy except I have 5 apps running and
   it should mention them in the file

b) dumps core if I start it as xtoolplaces

Any suggestions?  Is there source to the linux version I can get?

 Steve is correct, except that he forgot to point out that here he is talking
about the Andrew File System which ISU uses, a.k.a. AFS.

 AFS goes way beyond a typical filesystem tho, and isn't something you'd
probably want to implement with Linux.

 Actually though, there is a hard limit in that if the file exceeds your
quota amount by less than 1 Meg it will let you write it out.  If it exceeds
your quota amount by more than 1 Meg it will return an error:

>afs: failed to store file (over quota)

 You also get this message anytime you are over quota and try to write
another file.  It's not a particularly friendly environment, and is really
only used to establish quota's for the undergraduate students.  The research
staff and faculty are on NFS mounted disks, and they will begin using the
standard BSD quota system in the next month or two.

My guess would be that a better bet is to require is to:

a) Require the power to be on well beyond the bootup period (say 10
   minutes) before even monitoring the input.
b) Require it to keep an asserted level for several seconds.

Date: 15 Apr 1993 21:45:08 GMT

I am looking into putting Linux on a Gateway Nomad 486 DX2/50 and before I
do, I'd like to know whether anyone else has put Linux on this machine.
I checked the compatibility chart but did not see a "Nomad" or 
"Texas Instruments" machine there (the Gateway machines being repackaged
TI machines). Specifically, the Nomad comes with a "field mouse" (whatever
that is :). Does the field mouse emulate the Microsoft bus or serial mouse?

Also, I'm wondering how much video memory is on the machine. I would
think that a very large virtual console would be invaluable on a notebook
computer due to the relatively small display. In that event, even though
the thing can only do VGA, it would be great to have at least .5meg of
video memory. Do notebooks carry this much video memory?

fsck does not access the partition through the filesystem functions -
it directly accesses the block device beneath the filesystem.  So, in
effect, there are two concurrent users of the block device - the
filesystem, which is using it readonly, and the fsck program, which
has opened the same device for read-write.

This is safe, because the filesystem and fsck will both be seeing
exactly the same data - they will share the same buffer cache for the
device.

 Stephen Tweedie.

I want to be really sure that none of their data is lost.

Is that possible?  

Also, is there any other way of installing it rather than having

to back up 100 Mb on the harddrive first?

Thats true, i remember this one file.c in libtiff that compiled about 20 Minutes

I have NO experiences especially with the Minix-fs, but I use Unix,Linux,Sun,
whatever for 5 years now. From about 200 Crashes I have seen at customers or
wherever, it only happened 2-times that a fs was so destroyed that it was
not reparable. 90 percent where absolutely ok after an fsck, in about 10% there
were only 1 or 2 files destroyed.
I think, the cheapest way to protect from a crash is a frequently backup.

Get yourself a copy of Coherent.  It's sold by Mark Williams Company, and
comes in two flavors, v4.0 and v3.2.  You won't be able to use v3.2 -- 
becuase it requires a 386, but v4.0 should work.  MWC charges $99 for 
either version, regardless of price.  They do include nice documentation,
and their o.s. is much more stable (if it doesn't include as many nice
features -- like TCP/IP networking).   

A few notes -- you will be limited to programs that fit in 64K of ram.  You
won't be able to run X.  There are probably other limitations as well.  This
is because the 286 is an old cpu which doesn't have as much support for 
protection and large-space addressing as the 386.  Coherent 3.2 is the only
286 based version of Un*x I know of worth messing with. 

On a side note: if you're going to do anything real with Unix, get yourself
a 386 or 486 and save yourself some headaches. :-)

PS: There is a group devoted to Coherent on the internet... comp.os.coherent,
I think.

This is slightly peculiar if you are using e2fsprogs-0.2d - the
out-of-memory problem should not appear with this.  Are you sure you
weren't using an older version at the time?

e2fsck-0.2d and earlier had a slight oversight with the valid flag.
If they saw a filesystem with the valid bit not set, they would
happily go through and check for any errors on the filesystem.  Then,
if there were no errors, they would say so and exit - forgetting to
set the valid flag.  Paradoxically, then, the valid flag would only
get set if there were errors to be fixed.

Remy Card released e2fs-0.2e today, which cures this problem.  It is
available in /pub/linux/ALPHA/ext2fs on ftp.ibp.fr, and should be
available on tsx-11.mit.edu in the same directory soon.

Ahem, just how do you define a "real" computer?  I suppose it's one that
uses a microprocessor from the One True Micro Manufacturer, Intel?  Bullcorn.

I don't currently use a Macintosh, but I bought one of the original "Fat Macs"
when they came out.  I made a decision at that time to support what has always
been a superior chip design, the M68K.  The Intel's lack of registers and
segmented architecture was retro even then; it's quite unfortunate that IBM
chose this chip because this set the microprocessor industry back at least
10 years.

My point related to this thread is, there are many reasons for choosing a
particular machine.  How many of us had ever even heard of GNU prior to
becoming involved in computing?  I don't think GNU was even around when
I bought my first Mac (1983 I think).   Even if someone knows of GNU, this
is only one of the factors entering into a decision of what computer to
buy.  Personally I would not buy another Macintosh, but this is due to its
higher pricing and lack of decent development tools (which is why I got
rid of my old one), not some quasi-religious conviction such as you exhibit.

How about getting larger than 16 Mb partitions? Is that also just to
change one (or more) #define's?  I can't think of anyone who would
need more than, say, 16 swap areas, but larger than 16 Mb seems to be
a common desire.  How about changing 127x16 Mb to, say, 15x128 Mb?

msdos fs some time ago.  Just put the appropriate options in
/etc/fstab and do a regular mount -a.  Here is the relevant entry from
my fstab:

Subject: Better? XIAFS or EXT2FS?

I have been using XIAFS on my system now for about a month and am pretty
happy with it; however, I would like to get the most out of my machine. 
Which is better, xiafs or ext2fs??  Which one tends to be more efficient
at keeping down fragmentation?  Which one has better error recovery? 
Which one seems to be the most 'stable'?  Xiafs is certainly faster than
the old extfs, but I haven't been able to mess around with the ext2fs. 
BTW, all my partitions (including root) are xiafs and I have had no
problems (yet -- I'm knocking on wood :))...

This is a newbie question.  I was not able to find an answer in the FAQ.

I tried to install Linux from the SLS 99.6 files.  I got to the part where
it asks for the type of drive.  At this point I got the message:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at address C0000012
  Oops: 0000
  EIP:  0008:00118468
  EFLAGS:  00010206

  Pid:  3 , process nr: 3
  80 78 12 00 75 17 80 78 11 00

After I type in the disk number, I can proceed with fdisk, but at the end I
get exactly the same error message, plus a "Segmentation fault".

Does anybody know the cause this problem?  My setup is:
                  486-DX2/66 with 8-Meg
                  212-Meg Western Digital Caviar drive
                  Genoa Local Bus motherboard
                  Genoa 8500VL video card
                  AMI BIOS

Also, the instructions in the FAQ say to write-protect all installation disks,
but if I do that the installation program complains that the disk is write 
protected!

Many thanks in advance.

Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 22:53:54 GMT

Both free unixes are deemed reliable by many sources.

386BSD has better TCP/IP, for now.

Linux is far less resource-hungry, due to shared libraries.

386BSD fixes come out slowly, all at once.  Linux fixes come out quickly,
a little bit at a time.

Neither free unix has 24-bit color support.  Both will get it at the same
time if it comes available, as both use XFree86.

Snittily Graphics Consulting Services makes 24-bit X drivers for S3 928
based boards, for several commercial unixes.

Commercial unixes are all very expensive.  The cheapest is the new Univel
UNIXware - $250 for user version, $695 for the developer version.  All
others are well over $1000.  It's really rather silly, I think.

SCO Unix has been recommended to me as "the best" of the commercial
systems, by a few folks.

That's about all the info I have.  Look to the FAQs for more precise
breakdowns of the commercial stuff.

Cheers,
Brandon

        I am also working, on and off, on a compressed log structured
filesystem for Linux.  I'm busy with a lot of other things (like
making those Linux CDROM's that everyone uses), and it's slow going.
For example, just figuring out when you're out of disk space is 
a tough problem on compressed log structured filesystem, and there
are some basic kernel modifications that I need to make to, for
example, cache file data that doesn't correspond to a particular disk
block.  However, I thought that I would write this posting in the
hopes that even if I don't get this filesystem written, other people
doing Linux filesystems might be able to use these ideas.

        For the benefit of those of you who have not heard of log
structured filesystems, I will explain the basic idea.  When a
traditional filesystem updates a particular block of a file, it moves
the disk head and overwrites the disk block corresponding to that
particular block of the file (allocating such a block if it doesn't
exist).  On a log structured filesystem, the writes are recorded in a
contiguous log on the disk.  So, rather than moving the disk head to
the old location of the corresponding disk block, the file block is
appended the end of the log.  Once that block is written, the block
that points to it and the map of free blocks are updated to reflect
the fact that the file block has moved.  These blocks later written to
the logs, followed by the blocks that keep track of them.  Eventually
this chain of events terminates with a checkpoint block being written
to one of a small number of checkpoint regions (for example, there may
be two checkpoint regions so that the previous checkpoint is not
overwritten).  There aren't that many extra blocks that have to be
written, because many of the blocks will belong to the same file, so
they will share the same indirect blocks and other bookkeeping blocks.
Although a log structured filesystem actually writes more data to the
disk, it makes up for this, because the disk head doesn't have to do
any seeks.  By writing in a sequential log, a log structured
filesystem can theoretically do sustained random writes at close to
the maximum physical bandwidth of the disk.

        There are a number of ways in which a lot structured
filesystem can be implemented.  One way is to treat the whole disk as
one gigantic circular log.  The file system that Daniel is talking
about works that way.  On such a system, one can guarantee a certain
amount of free space for the log by simply rewriting any live data
blocks that are within that amount of space from the front of the log.
The problem with this approach is that a disk is generally going to be
about 75% full (otherwise the user would have bought a smaller disk),
so about 3 blocks will be rewritten for every new block that is
written.  This problem can be reduced substantially if the filesystem
simply skips the blocks that are in use, but, it takes just as long
for the disk head to skip over a single block as it does to write one.
In order to increase bandwidth, it would be necessary to skip whole
tracks, and whether even that is enough is debatable.

        A more popular way to organize a log structured filesystem
is to divide it into segments.  The log is written into an empty
segment.  When the system is running low on empty segments, it reads
the live data from a few live segments into one of the remaining empty
segments ("cleaning").  In this way, seldomly changed data is stuffed
into segments that rarely have to be cleaned.

        Proponents of log structured file systems argue that as RAM
size grows, read hit ratios on disk caches will increase toward 100%,
while a steady trickle of disk writes will continue to be necessary,
since dirty blocks are written to the disk every 30 seconds.
According to this reasoning, the relative performance of a filesystem
that maximizes write bandwidth should improve in comparison to a
traditional filesystem as RAM sizes grow.

        Log structured filesystems suffer from blocks that need to be
read together being dispersed all over the disk.  In comparison, the
4.3 BSD filesystem tries to put the blocks of a all of the files in a
directory in the same part of the disk.  When files that are read
together are also written together, then a log structured filesystem
has reasonable locality (e.g., a bunch of .o files are written during
a make and are then linked into an executable), otherwise a log
structured filesystem can do some other things to improve locality.
Firstly, a log structured filesystem can write all of the dirty blocks
for a file together.  A log structured file system may also be able
to get similar locality by selecting how it rearranges blocks when it
does segment cleaning (or some other type of garbage collection if it
isn't a segmented LFS).  The time that it takes to run the segment
cleaner is the other thing that brings the performance of log
structured filesystems down to the level of traditional filesystems.
On the other hand, if the workload of a system is primarily reads, it
can run the segment cleaner at night.

        Whether log structured filesystems are a win in practice is a
popular subject of debate.  Current benchmarks suggest that log
structured filesystems perform somewhat better that traditional
filesystems in some areas and somewhat worse than others.  Since a log
structured filesystem needs a segment cleaner, a fairer comparison
would probably be between a log structured filesystem and its cleaner
versus a traditional filesystem and a defragmenting program.  My
primary interest in a log structured filesystem is not for improving
performance, but, rather, for doing a compressed filesystem.

        The advantage of using a log structured filesystem for
compression is that the data that is written to the log can be
written to byte boundaries rather than disk block boundaries.
Squeezing out every byte from compression is not the only benefit
of this approach.  You can also adopt the convention of truncating
every block at its last non-zero byte.  On a traditional filesystem,
you waste about half of a block per file, because the last block
will be, on average, only half full.  If your average file size is
10kB, then your losing about 5% due to this internal fragmentation.
If you're running a news server, in which case, you'll have article
sizes of around 2kB, then you're losing 25% to internal fragmentation.
Currently, files larger than about 12kB need to use an indirect block
which is generally going to have a few non-zero entries followed by
mostly zeroes.  By using a log structured filesystem you can save
space by making more efficient use of compression and by trimming
trailing zeros from each block.  In addition, compression of metadata
such as indirect blocks and directory entries is possible (but not
required), random reads and random writes are fast, and data loss due
to media failure does not effect the decompression of other blocks
of same files that were corrupted by the media failure.

        Other possible features that can be added to log structured
filesystems include:

             1. RAID (Rapid Array of Inexpensive Disks).  Given n
                identical disks, break each segments into n-1 parts.
                Distribute these n-1 parts to the same regions of each
                of the first n-1 drives.  The last drive will hold the
                XOR of the n-1 parts of the segment, so that the
                contents of any drive can be reconstructed in the
                event of a drive failure.  More complex arrangements
                of drives and parity sectors are possible.  The
                problem with this scheme is that, for writes, all of
                the disk arms need to be used together, so the
                segments have to be fairly large for the system not to
                spend most of its time seeking.

             2. REPLICATING SEGMENTS.  It may be advantageous to
                replicate frequently read but rarely modified segments
                to different parts of the disk to reduce seek times.
        
             3. more flexibility for ENCRYPTION.  Some encryption
                algorithms change the size of their data.  It's easier
                to support such algorithms if your block size is
                variable.  Admittedly, this is a pretty contrived advantage.

        There are also other advantages of using a filesystem that
reallocates blocks instead of overwriting them, such as a log
structured filesystem:

             1. CRASH PROOFING in the sense that the filesystem will be
                in a consistent state when the system reboots, provided
                that a crash will leave any block that was being written
                to disk either completely written, completely unwritten,
                or in a detectable error state.

             2. FILESYSTEM FORKING: the ability to instantly clone the
                filesystem into basically two parallel universes
                that use additional disk sectors on a copy-on-write basis
                only for the things that they change (useful for taking a
                snapshot to do a disk backup).

             3. TIME TRAVEL (basically this involves holding onto a
                snapshot of the filesystem at every consistency point
                for the period that you want to be able to visit).

             4. easily adapted to WRITE-ONCE MEDIA

             5. DIGITAL SIGNATURES.  Add a new field in the data
                structure that points to a disk block: the digital
                signature of the contents of that block.  When you write
                a new block, you update not only the address of that block,
                but also the system's signature of that block.  Any
                attempt to write to alter filesystem without the
                system's digital signature can be detected (perhaps
                the signature would have to be provided at mount
                time).  The one exception is that an adversary could
                overwrite the disk with a snapshot of the disk at some
                previous time.  It may also be possible to extend this
                scheme to have digital signatures for each user, but I
                haven't worked all of the details out.  The problem is
                that the system has to be able to relocate a user's
                files without the user's digital signature without
                giving an adversary the ability to restore another
                user's file to a previous state.  If these problems
                can be worked out, it would make it possible to
                require every user to sign his or her setuid files,
                for example.

             6. OBSCURING DELETED DATA.  Similar to #5, but instead of
                signing each block, a random key is generated every
                time a new block is to be written.  The new block is
                encrypted with that key, and the key is stored with
                the pointer the block.  The pointers to the indirect
                blocks form a hierarchical encryption scheme, so that
                as soon as an old checkpoint is overwritten, the key
                to decrypt any data that is not pointed to by a
                current checkpoint is lost.

        It is worth noting that it would not be too difficult to adapt
a traditional filesystem like ext2fs to reallocate blocks instead of
overwriting them.  The only changes in the disk format would be to use
data structures that could be updated by block reallocation for things
like the inode table and the free block table.  The easiest way to
make these changes is to treat the inode table and the free block
table as regular files.

        Before anybody rushes off to change all of the Linux
filesystems to do reallocate on write, it is worth noting that
reallocating blocks is not without cost.  Reallocating blocks requires
additional disk writes to update the block that pointed to the block
that has been updated, to update the list of free blocks, and to do
similar bookkeeping for these other blocks which had to be written.

        The only things in this posting that are actually my ideas are
the suggestions for trimming trailing zeros, encryption, replicated
segments, digital signatures, and obscuring deleted data.  If you want

Look, this sort of adolescent bickering about the merits/shortcomings of
a particular brand of computer were fun when I was an adolescent, but now
they're just irritating.  Please take it somewhere other than comp.os.linux.

And since I can't stop myself from adding....

Computers are just tools.  Just as most people don't use hacksaws to pound
nails, so too do certain computers/OS's have sensible applications.  I've
got access to Macs and PC clones, and whatever does the job best gets used
at that particular moment.

Of course, if you're determined to be irrationally biased as to the fact that
your particular computer is the greatest all-around computing device since
Charles Babbage first coined the expression "Difference Engine"-- well, I'm
certainly not going to waste any more time talking to you.

How about just using a utility to convert Sun audio files over to a format
that splay can handle?  I have a program called SOX that can translate au
sounds into voc sounds.  SOX is capable of doing other kinds of conversions
as well.  Of course you'll have to go to the trouble of converting the
sounds over first before you can play them, but that shouldn't be a big deal.

Unless I'm mistaken, you can get SOX off of nic.funet.fi.  It should be under
/pub/unix/sound.  The name of the file is sox7.linux.tar.Z.

Greetings all!
I have the SLS version of Linux with a 0.99.6 kernel running
on a 386DX with 8Mb RAM a mouse on /dev/ttyS0 and a modem on
/dev/ttyS1

When I enter kermit I get a I/O error: can't read from line
or something similar.  The permissions on this line were
originally rwx-w--w- but I played with all variations with no
positive results.  *NO* communications programs will work.
This modem is a Hayes 2400 compatible.  I did not have this
problem under 0.99.4 TAMU.  All help is appreciated.

That is a permission problem. Read /usr/doc/nn6.4.18/PROBLEMS !

First be sure that /usr/local/lib/nn

some ups's do this sort of thing the other way around - they have the
power supply notify the computer a little before the power goes away.
while this is obviously the best way for a ups, mightn't it also be
easier for this purpose, too?  having the computer look for an

particularly difficult to swing.

I have a few questions about Linux.  I haven't read a FAQ, so bear with me.

Does Linux support virtual memory, or once system RAM is used up, crash city?
How stable is Linux?  Is it only good for playing with?
Where is Linux available?

Subject: Install/Configure help needed
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 04:30:34 GMT

Hi there,
        I picked up the SLS Linux at sunsite, and after a number of different
repartitions and installs :), I have the proper disk setup, however I
have not been able to get lilo or tcp/ip to work properly.

        First, the lilo problem.  I run DOS, OS/2, and now Linux, and
have the OS/2 boot manager installed.  I used OS/2's fdisk to partition
the system as detailed in the FAQ.  I have attempted to use lilo to make
my Linux partition bootable, but it consistently gives me a message very
close to "LILO  signature not found on boot sector" and won't install.
I used the command line given in the FAQ, to wit "/etc/lilo/lilo -c -b /dev
/hda6 -v -v /Image", and I have attempted the install on a primary and logical
drive (and the extended partition holding the logical drive), all to no
avail.  The lilo version is 7, I believe.

        Second, the tcp/ip problem.  The problem really isn't tcp/ip,
rather it's the IRQ on my card.  I have a 3c503 Etherlink II, on IRQ 3, but
autodetect attempts to use IRQ 5.  So, I figured I needed to recompile
the kernel with the changed IRQ.  I attempt to follow the instructions
in the /usr/src/linux/README file, however, "make dep" reports a number
of missing header files (mktime.h, etc.), and plain "make" fails as
well.  What's up with that?  

Thanks in advance,
Ted

Ok, I got the same response when dl'ing with UUCP(taylor 1.04), and scrolling
up through a command buffer(up arrow, once in bash, once in ATP(.QWK packet

It would seem that UUCP is the common link here.  I've only experienced this 
while running Taylor 1.04, and scrolling up.  It's happened twice, and it
shocked hell out of me both times.

Oh well.  If this statistic is of any use to anyone, good luck.

Subject: problems with TERM109 (detailed description)
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 02:27:27 GMT

G'day all,
  I've been running Linux (I'm pretty sure that's right).99P6 
for a few days now, and have been having a ball.

The fun stopped, though when trying to use 
TERM.  I'll do my best to give you a run down on the details of what
happens when I try to use it, hopefully someone will be able to 
point me in the right direction.

First off, I HAVE read the docs that come with the source code for
TERM109, which I obtained from tartarus.uwa.edu.au.  They are
quite comprehensive and come with a README that gives a step by step
description of how to get it up and running.

Here's the system I'm using (I don't think it's too relevant,
but I should say in case someone spots a prob with it):
  486-33 215K cache
  8meg ram
  80 Meg Western Digital (IDE) running DOS only 
  250 Meg Maxtor (IDE):
     hdb1     150Meg     DOS
     hdb2     65 Meg     Linux mounted as /
     hdb3     32 Meg     Linux (roughly 32 meg, anyways), not mounted
     hdb4     8  Meg     Linux SWAP

I'm running a standard Hayes 2400 baud modem to a DEC station. The modem
does not have MNP4 or 5 (error correction or compression). I don't mean
to over simplify things, guys, but I don't want to skip anything.

I'm booting a Linux image from a 5.25" A drive, using the disk that
the SLS install disks make after they put the A series on the hard drive.

I am logged on tty1 as ROOT.

I use XC -l /dev/modem  (/dev/modem is a link to /dev/ttyS0), and have
no problems logging in at 2400 baud.

OK from here on, REMOTE system refers to the INTERNET machine
                 LOCAL system refers to MY machine at home.

The REMOTE system has no TERMDIR set, and therefore refers to ~/.term
to find the termrc file.  The REMOTE system is running CSH, though I've
been told the shell shouldn't make a difference.

The LOCAL system has TERMDIR set to /tmp, and therefore refers to
~/tmp/.term for it's termrc file.  The LOCAL system is running TCSH.

The contents of the TERMRC file on both machines are identical and
are as follows:

escape 17
escape 19
escape 147
escape 149

I have also tried it with other ESCAPE clauses (including two that
escaped 25% of the character set, as suggested in the term/README).
I know that I can run linecheck to see what characters need to be
escaped, but this TERMRC has worked for people who live close by
to me. Btw, line noise is very low on my exchange, ie. have never
seen bad characters on the screen (apart from when someone picks
up the phone :) )

I run TERM on the REMOTE machine, and return to the XC command prompt.

I enter "$ term -d64" which runs another TCSH shell with stdin and stdout
set to /dev/modem by default.  Alternatively, I can exit XC completely
and type "TERM -d64 < /dev/modem > /dev/modem. Both options give the
same results.

OK, to my knowledge I've done everything right so far.

I run another ROOT login on tty2, and type "TRSH"

The modem TX and RX lights flash a couple of times, then the machine
freezes.

I look at tty1 where TERM is running locally, and I see that a few
bytes have gone back and forth between the REMOTE and the LOCAL machine,
but tty2 is just sitting there with nothing happening.

As a test, I decided to see if I could use TUPLOAD, and I can, it works
fine.  I can login as ROOT on 5 consoles and run FIVE TUPLOAD sessions,
swap back to TTY1 to check the DEBUG output from the LOCAL TERM, and
see it furiously sending packets back and forth to the 5 local clients.

So how come I can use TUPLOAD but not TRSH?  Could someone PLEASE let me
know what I might be doing wrong?

Subject: problems with TERM109 (SUMMARY)
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 02:31:27 GMT

This is a summary of the article I posted detailing my problems with 
TRSH.

In short, is there anyone who knows why I might be having problems
getting TRSH to give me a shell, considering TUPLOAD works just
fine?

Some settings:

LOCAL:
termdir = /tmp
shell = /bin/tcsh

REMOTE:
shell = /bin/csh

termdir is not set on the REMOTE machine, so it should use ~/.term
as the directory to house TERMRC.

TERMRC on both machines:
escape 17
escape 19
escape 145
escape 147


If you need more details, check out the other post I made, entitled
"problems with TERM109 (detailed description)".

ANideas welcome!!

Cheers,

Keith

It didn't make it here.  I read c.o.l. pretty religiously, and I never saw 
either of your posts.

I have been using the current UltraStor driver ever since I started working 
on it about three months ago.  Since then, I have used it (sometimes heavily)
with every available filesystem (minix, ext, xia, ext2) with no problems.
Until 99.7A, my /tmp and /usr filesystems were ext; now they are ext2; every-
thing has run smoothly on my 14F.  Also, I have received several reports of
others using the driver with no problems, and only one bug report (fixed in
99.7A).

If I needed a really good SCSI adapter, I'd buy it in a second! ;-)
But I already have one.

Seriously, you should try to return it; it may very well be defective.

Hi,
        How can I allow other users to mount files like the floppy for example.
My problem is that I want to allow other users to use their msdos - floppy s
in the drive, but only root can mount.  Another solution to this problem would
be if someone could tell me how I can get mtools to recognize a low density
5 1/4" floppy.  For some reason, it seems that fdprms has the requisite header
but it seems to be unable to read it. (unless my fdprm is wrong).  Any help
would be appreciated.  How can I give super-user (limited) status to some?


Thanks,

Subject: Will Amiga Linux support AGA?
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 93 00:24:41 GMT

I understand that there are some people who are currently working on
creating a version of Linux for the Amiga.  My question is this:
will Amiga Linux be able to take advantage of the new AGA chipset
that is in the Amiga 1200 and Amiga 4000?  It would really be nice
if it could.  Then you'd be able to run X with 256 colors in
resolutions such as 640x480 and 800x600 (more with overscan).  Plus,
the video would be a helluva lot faster.  As a matter of fact, my
Amiga 1200 (14.3Mhz 68020) has video that is *much* faster than my
33Mhz 486DX with SVGA card.

Unfortunately, my A1200 doesn't have a MMU in it.  Is there anyway
that I could install one without having to buy an accelerator card?
I'm thinking about purchasing a 68030 board sometime in the future
anyhow but it would be nice if I could just buy a MMU and pop that
in there instead---this would save me a lot of money.  Then later
on I could buy an accelerator to get better performance.

Perhaps Amiga Linux could come with a set of drivers that would
allow you to use either the original, enhanced, or AGA chipsets.
Just install the appropriate driver then you're in business.  This
scheme would also have another advantage:  whenever Commodore
releases a new chipset a driver could be written to take advantage
of it.  So, Amiga Linux would be able to run on any new models that
C= comes out with.  Would it be difficult to do this?

Remember, if Amiga Linux will only be able to run on the old Amigas
then you'd only be able to bring up X with 16 colors at 640x200 or
640x400.  Worse yet you'd be limited to either 512K or 1024K of chip
RAM, depending upon what kind of Agnus you have under the hood.

I realize that work is still underway on Amiga Linux and that X isn't
of course.  Probably a long ways off I gather; have to come up with a
working kernel first!  However, what I'm saying is still something
that should be taken into consideration, if for no other reason then
for the compatibility issues involved here.

        I looked on sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
/pub/Linux/utils/compress, but could not find a compression package to
handle LHA type compression.  Reason I am looking for one is that I
recently compiled the sound blaster support into my kernel, and I want to
get my hands on some .mod files.  Most of the ones I know about are
compressed using LHA compression.  The site I know about that has some is
nic.funet.fi in directory /pub/amiga/audio/modules.  These are all stored
as LHA.  Does any know where I can get the linux port of LHA?  Or, better
yet, a site that has .mods using zip compression.  Thanks for any help.

I found that the crond in the vixie-cron package on sunsite & tsx was
sufficiently old that it no longer works, so i extracted working
binaries from the SLS and found REAL manpages elsewhere to get it
going on my system.  Since this took me some time (finding a specific
binary in the SLS in not easy) I figured it would be good to share my
results:

sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/Incoming/cron.tar.z is essentially a
replacement for .../system/Daemons/vixie-cron.tar.Z, but with man
pages and in the usual sls tar format; tar xzvvpf it from / and all
will be well once /etc/crond is added to /etc/rc.

note that the man pages are gzipped for the new perl man.

Subject: problems using HD_TYPE to avoid using BIOS
Date: 16 Apr 1993 01:14:37 -0500

hey all.  This is yet another post requesting help on the same old saga
of getting my mfm and ide to coexist.   Numerous people sent me email
suggesting that I hard code my drives geometry using the HD_TYPE macro
defined in config.h and take my ide off my cmos.  This seems like a 
resonable idea.  I tried this and found that the image I generated
still used the bios so I was hosed.  I confirmed that it was using the 
bios by noticing the following:  When I originally booted up with the mfm
in and the ide not specified the system got a kernel panic telling me that
it couldn't mount root.  When I removed the mfm and left the rest alone, I
got the same error.  When I reset my cmos and put my ide back on it, the
kernel came up fine.  strange.  I could be using the HD_TYPE macro incorrectly.
oh, before I forget, yes I did comment out the line #undefing HD_TYPE.  My
ide disk has 8 heads, 33 sectors and 776 cylinders, the landing zone is 776.
My mfm *I THINK* has the following geometry: 4 heads, 17 sectors 615 cylinders,
wpcom 128 and a landing zone of 638.  <- I got these because the only 
documentation on my mfm says that on a compaq (not that I have one) it should
be listed in the cmos as a type 2.  So I called compaq and asked about the
geometry of a type 2 disk.  I'm pretty hosed.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
I'm using the 0.99pl8 kernel.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: EISA video cards supported?

I'm preparing to ditch a MIPS-based workstation and replace it with
a 486DX50 w/EISA slots. Please forgive my ignorance, but I'm wondering
if an EISA variant of any of the cards listed in the Linux X11 supported
hardware list (the Orchid ProDesigner IIs, say) will work. I'm interested
in driving a 1024x768x256 NI, or better, display. If the answer is
affirmative, I'd love to hear people's impressions of the relative speed
of ISA, EISA, and LB variants of similar boards. I have heard the 
arguments touting local bus over EISA, and I mostly agree with them.
Due to circumstances, I will most likely end up with an EISA machine
anyway.

Thank you.

Subject: Problems configuring news, etc
Date: 16 Apr 93 07:04:58 GMT

News problems:
 
News programs (/usr/local/lib/news...) is setup as suid.  Tin is not.  
When I run tin as a regular user, posting fails due to permissions.  
(why do all my problems seem related to permissions - ingres, news, 
mail, etc?)
root is able to post (sometimes) but no-one else can.  
Scratch that now - noboby can post anymore - (3 days later)
 
Why doesn't tin call config (/usr/local/lib/news/config) with effective 
uid of 'news'?  Should tin be su/gid news?
 
After fiddling with config, I made it a+r so the config problems are now 
gone.
 
After much hacking around, posts are now accepted from ordinary users,  
but they are dumped.  I still get the error:
                relaynews: set[ug]id failed (invalid argument)
then it dumps the article in dead.article.

Lots of the other utilities (news related) do not  run properly - some problem
or the other, which may all be linked, or not.
 
 
If those are just regular problems that will be cleared up with "proper" 
setup (and much reading) then don't bother, but if it is unusual stuff, 
please reply (post if possible?).  Thanks.
 

Note:  I do not yet have a feed, but I'm trying to get everything 
working before I activate my link to avoid trashing things for others 
when I do connect in the next week.  I have SLS 99pl6 and the latest 
of smail/news/elm/tin/nn, etc (April 10/11)

Thanks for any assistance.  I might also need help in configuring my UUCP 
files for my feed.  Can someone mail me an example - if it is complicated, 
or if it is a simple solution (i managed to work my way through TCP/IP and
most of the news stuff), then just a simple RTFF (FAQ) will suffice.  In case
any instructions are forthcoming, it would help to explain what the different
options do since I wish to understand (and maybe help someone else?).  I hope
I'm not asking too much.

setup others thru serial line download of the files. The only glitch is that I
don't know how to set up the cabling between the serial lines for a successful
download. I tried the following without success.

1) Connect the com2's together of the two PC's in question with a
   female-female null modem cable.
2) setup both serial ports (/dev/cua2) for 38400baud, 8bits, crtscts, noparity
   -ixon clocal.
3) from the source machine (the one which has a complete setup) I did a
   tar cvf /dev/cua2 and at the sink I did a tar xvf /dev/cua2.

Well, tar on the source side starts firing but the destination side gets
nothing.  What am I doing wrong?

BTW, here is my configuration (both m/c are same)

   Gateway 486/33 (Vesa local bus)
   16450 based serial ports (total of 2 serial and 1 parallel)
   Linux 0.99 pl 8
   Actix GEPlus (801 with 2M Dram) video card
   General setup with the latest of the binaries (as far as I know).

Any help would be appreciated.

It's a known bug (and a very silly one) in the 0.99.7A keyboard driver
routines.  It happens mostly when the keyboard does auto-repeat on keys
that send multi-byte sequences (ie cursor keys and other special keys),
but depends a bit on the hardware as well (ie it won't happen on some
hardware, while being almost common on other).

It's the up-scrolling, and possibly the race-condition is made worse by
serial interrupts going on etc, which is why you see it during UUCP. 
Others see it only under X11 (probably due to similar reasons), others
won't see it at all...  The fix is to get pl8 (together with the vm86
diff if you use NFS or dosemu),

Setting CLOCAL is the correct way to solve this --- it is not a bug in
the kernel.  Since you only have three wires connected, it means that
the carrier detect line was left floating, and probably floated to
ground.  Thus, the /dev/ttyS1 device blocked waiting for carrier detect
to go high.  The reason why the login prompt appeared is that getty
opened /dev/ttyS1 with the NODELAY flag; but when /dev/ttyS1 was
reopened for /bin/login, it did not have the NODELAY flag, and you ended
up blocking.

That's what the CLOCAL flag is for --- it indicates that the serial port
is hooked up to a local (hence CLOCAL) terminal, and so the carrier
detect line should be ignored.  In general, whenever the carrier detect
line is not supported by a serial device, or if your RS-232 cable does
not support the CD wire, the CLOCAL flag should be set.

Ask the person who created the install procedure (Peter MacDonald, in
the case of SLS).

When you're dialing out (i.e., kermit, cu, seyon, uucp, etc.).

>On my configuration ttyS3 is named ttys3 incorrectly - why? 
Again, see the person who created the install procedure.  Recent
versions of SLS create the serial devices using the new convention
(ttyS3).  ttys3 represents an older convention, and some older install
procedures may not have switched over.

IRQ 2 is also often free, although some networking cares use them.

   Can I use IRQ 7 when not printing? 

It's generally a bad idea to have two cards plugged in sharing an IRQ
address.  It happens to work with most serial cards, but it doesn't
alwas work.  You can use IRQ 7 if you don't have a parallel port plugged
into your system.  If you do have a parallel port plugged in, you can
try using IRQ 7; it might work, it might not.  Be sure to also make sure
that the printer works after you plug in your serial card configured to
use IRQ 7.  Another alternative: If you are using the version of the
parallel printer driver that doesn't use interrupts, you can go to your
parallel port board, and disable the IRQ, thus freeing IRQ 7.

     Is pin 1 nearest to the plate or is it 31?

If this is a sample PC ISA card, then A1 is the pin closest the "back" of
the card, and on the top, if the pins are held down and the "back" of
the card is to your right:

The problem isn't the swap-page encoding (the encoding will allow
127x128MB happily), but due to my lazyness.  A swap area needs a "swap
page counter array", where each page (4kB) uses one byte as a counter
that tells how many different processes use the page.  And due to the
normal linux memory management routines, it's hard to allocate an array
bigger than one page - thus you get a maximum swap area of 4096 pages
which is 16MB.. 

The coding necessary to use several pages for swap counters isn't
overwhelming: in fact I have already gotten one patch for it (sorry to
have forgotten the name of the person who sent it to me), and the only
reason I didn't use it was that I'm a bit nervous about the memory
management, so I either want to do it myself or be *very* sure there are
no problems with the patch..

So the current 16MB limit isn't anything fundamental (unless you call my
lazyness that), and one day you'll wake up and notice that linux
automatically takes advantage of more than 16MB of swap. The only
problem now is "when?", and I can't say.

Hi,

Here is a small patch to the kernel to fix the problems which Hercules
card owners have with XFree86 1.2.  With the patch installed, vt
switching works as advertised and the console is returned to text mode
upon exit from XFree86.

To install the patch, put it in a file (eg "patches"), cd to
where you have put the Linux source (usually /usr/src) and do
"patch < patches". Re-compile the kernel, install the Image, and
re-boot.

Remember that XFree grabs the first vt which is not in use for itself,
therefore to switch back to XFree from another vt you need to switch
to that vt, not the one where you started XFree. On many systems this
will probably be vt #5, in which case Alt-F5 gets you back to XFree.
On my system, I have logins on 6 vts so I have to do Alt-F7.

I have mailed this patch to Linus, so if he approves it may appear in
the next release of the kernel.


Good luck!

From: linux@fylz.com (Linux Journal)
Subject: Linux Journal -- magazine
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 02:07:10 GMT

A few months ago a group of people in the U.S. (some in Seattle but
stretching all the way to the east coast) started talking about an idea
for a magazine.  The initial magazine idea is still undergoing some
changes but, in the process, the idea for the Linux Journal was born.

Why does the Linux community need a magazine?  The publisher of a
technical magazine I was talking to put it this way: "No successful
movement has ever made it without a journal reporting on its progress."
Well, Linux Journal wants to be that journal for the Linux movement.

There is a questionnaire at the end of this post.  We would like to
encourage your input.  If this magazine is going to happen it needs to
be what people want.  "The Net" is one audience we need to hear from.
The other, harder to find, audience are all the people that don't know
about or have access to the net.  If you know people who fit in this
category, please either give them a copy of the questionnaire to
mail or FAX back or send us their address and we will mail them a flyer.

Some details of our plans:
  * We will be a monthly publication focusing on the world of Linux
  * We will minimize lead time so the information will be current
  * We will cover both "free" and commercial software
  * We will report on the Linux project as a whole
  * We want to help newcomers as well as those with *ix experience
  * Our first issue will be out by September 1

The answers we get from this questionnaire will help us complete our
advertising policy and editorial policy.  

Thanks for your time -- Phil, Laurie, Mike, ...

What exactly are the requirements for this to happen?  I remember when I 
initially installed linux on my system that I had real problems getting 
mke2fs to like my partitioning scheme.  Now that I've decided to ditch
DOS altogether, I was trying to make another partition, but I can't use
the partition that I made. 

Can anyone tell me what the correct "parameters" (so to speak) are for making
an ext2 filesystem??

In a "DOS" based network, diskless workstations boot (either with special
software or a firmware chip in the network card) from a server.  The server
downloads via ethernet a boot image file (previously setup on the server)
which the PC then uses as a virtual drive A.  The PC then boots from this
disk image, which then sets up all the network o/s specific stuff in the 
config.sys and autoexec.bat that resides in the boot (disk) image.

I don't think it would be terribly hard to write a low-level ethernet
listening daemon that listens out for the remote-boot requests that the
ethernet card sends out - from there it could send a Linux boot disk
image to the PC, which would then proceed to boot from that image.  The
image you could set up on a floppy (and then image to a file) would have
the kernel and some basic utils, and an /etc/rc file - in this you would 
need to NFS mount the rest of the filesystems that the workstation
needed.  

Has anyone written something like this yet?  I might be interested enough
to get the specs on some of the more popular brands of ethernet cards
and try to implement this - if they are standard enough.

If any linux guru's would care to give a few pointers in regard to the
writing of the actual "daemon" I would appreciate any input.  I'm not 
sure what level the network card's remote-boot request is sent at - I 
am pretty sure it isn't netbios and I know it isn't tcp/ip :)  does
this mean it would need to be written in the kernel?  or just a hardware
specific daemon that waits for a specific request?

To quote a silly robot - INPUT!

Take care all

As I understand it, the device name for the first logical partition
would be /dev/hda5, hda1 through hda4 refer to primary partitions.

Am I nuts here? Seems like you just need a layer of code between the
virtual disk your filesystem see's, and the physical media.  This code
can maintain and map multiple compressed blocks (say 4K) into physical
uncompressed block numbers used by the filesystem code.  The only trick
I see is having a filesystem that has a dynamic size.  This should not
be insurmountable either, as one could define the size of the virtual
disk as arbitrarily 3X, and then use a non-removeable psuedo file entry
to eat up any unavailable space, or reduce it's psuedo "size" from 2X
the disk as successful compression kicks in.  In this way you always see
"real" space available, but space in use would be dynamic shifting from
the pseudo file to real files and back as compression occurs or
compressed space is free'd.  For any kind of data integrity compression
should be done on a block by block basis (4K at least), but perhaps with
n smaller sub-blocks (256bytes?) being sqeezed into each block.  That
way a trashed block won't kill you for more than 16K of data (@4:1).

For example the filesystem wants block #20, hands off to the virtual
translator which looks in a table and finds virtual block 20 is offset
512 characters in physical block 3.  It fetches it, uncompresses it, and
delivers the appropriate chunk of data back.

In the reverse, if the virtual block won't squeeze back in, it will have
to drift onto a different physical block until it fits.  Just like a
variable length ISAM file record.  Hell design the directory structure
and file system as a B-tree variaton.  Oooohhm, It's *LATE* yawn, and
I'm rambling ....

Reply-To: keh5@midway.uchicago.edu
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 05:44:36 GMT


I am running Linux 0.99pl6-26; SLS distribution brought down from
tsx-11.mit.edu on 4/11/93.  The box:  486DX, 4Meg, 120MB SCSI w/
Adaptec 1542b.

I have been running Linux since 0.97 with little (if any) serious
problems.  Now something has popped up that I just can't resolve.

It occurs when I run X, but I don't think X is the problem per se:

#1      olwm just doesn't behave correctly from the get go.
#2      when I exit (harshly with CTRL-ALT-BS) I have a long
        list of:
>       olwm:  Warning, X Error:  BadGC (invalid GC parameters)
>        Request Major Code: 74
>        Request Minor Code: 0
>        ResourceID 0x800030.
        errors.
#3      The machine is then in a pseudo-locked up state.  I can get
        to another tty but cannon login.  While I was trying to hash
        this problem out, I accidently switched to tty3...
#4      The screen is _full_ of the single error message:
>       rw_swap_page: bad swap file


I have done little to the SLS distribution startup files, only the following
two lines:

<BOF>
># swapfile
>mkswap /usr/local/paging/swapfile 5120
>swapon /usr/local/paging/swapfile
>
>/usr/bin/setterm -blank 10     <-- Beginning of SLS stuff.

at the beggining of /etc/rc.local.  I don't get any errors at startup
and free after login reports:
        
             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:          2920       1672       1248        384        780
Swap:         5116          0       5116

I'm not sure where my mistake has been and would appreciate some quick
advice if possible.  I _really_ don't wanna dig through source code for
the answer.

Please reply by email; I've cluttered the c.o.l enough with this post I'm
sure.

I obtained and untarred SLS disks x1-x10.  I have an Xconfig
I believe is right.  My (Logitech) mouse passes HJ's mouse test.

My questions are:
a.  What's "the real one" and where might I obtain it?
    Is there a heavy C shared image?
    Does SLS use a different set of libraries than HJ supplies?
b.  What document should I have read that I would know what a

Folks,

Michael K. Johnson and I have decided to use the Linux seagull logo on the
title page of the Linux Documentation Project manuals as well as other
works. We're working right now on integrating the logo with the current
linuxdoc.sty LaTeX style format used by the LDP.

While this by no means makes it "official", it's about as official as you
can get in the Linux community. The seagull represents many things about
Linux: its size (Linux is a small UNIX), freedom, internationalization (where
in the world aren't seagulls found?), flexibility, and, well... flight (from
the world of DOS). If any animal or design represents Linux it is the seagull.

Although I'm probably not interested in receiving tons of email trying to
persuade me out of this decision, if you design a good-looking Linux logo
depicting some other animal (or no animal at all?) feel free to send it 
along. PostScript is fine, but MetaFont source would be better. The seagull
has so far been the most appropriate available design, and we really liked
it. A platypus? Okay, if the mammal body represents System V and the duckbill
represents BSD, then you may have something there... :)

Cheers,
mdw

Subject: Farenheit Discontinued - BUY NOW!!!
Date: 16 Apr 93 10:46:36 GMT

Hi

When I went to but an Orchid Farenheit 1280 card to replace my Trident,
the dealer told me that this card had been discontinued in favour of
the VA version. He then went on to say that he still had a few left,
but that they are as rare as hens teeth and I should buy one now, as
they are faster than the VA. Since fast video is more important than
the gimmicky VA, and I wasn't sure if XS3 could take advantage of
the VA feature (or even drive the card) so I bought the 1280.

OK, the questions are:

1. Was the dealer just trying to shift the last of his 1280s to some mug,
   or are they genuinely faster (it would seem logical since the 1280
   has VRAM but the VA ordinary DRAM).

2. If it is faster, how much.

3. Are there plans to write a device driver for the VA features (it's
   not too late to change my card).

TIA
Mark

I disagree.  A compiler represents a huge security hole.  System attacks
can be mounted at the lowest level using a compiler.  If memory serves,
the Internet worm of a few years ago propogated itself by recompiling
itself and redistributing the source to other systems for recompilation.

Agreed, however few people have the time, patience, or knowledge required
to generate any program of significant complexity by hand.  The compiler 
would make attacks easier and faster and more available to hackers of
lesser talents.

Not that I am arguing against making compilers available, or that linux
is inferior by virtue of poor security- simply that compilers do represent
potential security problems.

Hello, 
Do you have an idea how much memory your Cache supports?
This depends on the size of Tag-RAM, the size of your Cache-line and the
size of your Cache. It is possible, that your Cache supports only 16MB of
RAM, especially if you have an older board. Recently, I had the same problem,
too. 
Solutions: Upgrade Cache-RAM if possible or buy new board.
I don't know if this *is* the problem, but it might be.

Hope this helps,

This error seems to be a Kernel-TCP Bug, a guy an myself had exactly the

I have traced the Ethernet traffic with the PD "Gobbler" Packet
Analyzer and found, that the Linux box sends a few tcp packets to
the remote printer server and the gets a major timeout problem.
If the printer server acknowledges to slow to the linux tcp packets,
linux tcp seems not to handle the new SYN packets correctly.
When I use the old 99pl4, and trace it, the sequence is correct,
and if SYN is needed due to slow printer servers, its recovered ok.

On 99pl8 TCP the trace looks like this : 5 - 6 packets sent, Linux TCP
doesn't wait for the ACK and opens a new source port without closing
the old one. Perhaps Linus can help ?

: Any and all ideas are welcome...

me too , :-),
Temp. solution: use 99pl4 kernel if you want LPR package to print
on (slow) remote printers.

I did a port of MIT-Scheme 7.2.0 (alpha) for linux; it seems to
run quite well; edwin and native 386 compiler also run.

I did not released the port because it's of an alpha version --
I was waiting for an official release before making the package available.

Anyway, if you are really interested in the program (compiler and edwin
require at least 10Mb of memory, so on my 8Mb machine they swap almost
with continuity), I could upload the program somewhere. In the meantime, 
you can retrieve my linux port of Scheme-to-C by anonymous ftp
on artemide.dei.unipd.it, in the directory /pub/linux .

Please let me know if anybody else is interested on a release of the port
of C-scheme 7.2.0 (alpha) for linux.

Hello out there.
Me again.
Yesterday I asked for help linking the math-libary using GCC.
Many told me to use '-lm' instead of '-l m'. I did this before -
and did not detect any difference in GCC's behaviour.
Using AIX-GCC on rs6000 both works fine. With me none at all.
By the way there is another funny observation:
   adding -l m.a causes the error: libm.a not found.
   this should be 'libm.a.a' not found, no?
If you need further information:
   I'm using GCC-2.3.3, lib4.3.2, Linux-0.99.7

OK.

Reply-To: Timo.Korvola@hut.fi
Date: 16 Apr 93 15:41:41


I applied the NFS patch to 0.99.8 and now xdm lets local non-root clients
connect again.  Thanks to Guy Thomas for pointing that out.  (I have a lot
of stuff on NFS disks, including home directories).

However, magic cookie authentication still refuses to work for remote
clients.  I transfer the authentication key to a remote machine with xauth
and rsh, it gets trasfered correctly (xauth lists the same key on both
ends), yet the server won't accept connections from any client on the
remote machine.  So I have to resort to using xhost, which is unsecure on
hosts with many users.

I'd appreciate any help.

Another problem, which came up when I tried to recompile xdm, is that the
version 4.3.3 header files net/if.h, net/if_arp.h, net/if_route.h now only
include the respective files from /usr/include/linux.  However, no such
headers are distributed with the kernel.

Well, YES!!!!. You can have other way of installing Linux without

There is an utility named FIPS which re-partition your disk in a

It works!. I helped a friend to install Linux in a 100 MB. DOS

Get the file NEW from sunsite.unc.edu, dir. /pub/Linux. There you

A simpler way might be to put a slow timer in the box along with a counter.
When the meachanical switch flips, it resets the counter in the box you're
building. Then the counter start counting (at say, 1 or two Hz). When
it gets to some sufficiently large power of two (say 8 or 16), the 
counter turns itself off and starts paying attention to the line coming
in from the linux box.

I think you could probably do this with a count, 555 timer, and probably
a couple of and gates (to ignore the linux box for a while and to turn
off the timer - might need a not as well). Thus, the total circuitry would
probably cost about $2 and be much simpler then building a full state
sequencer. 

If you ever get anything working, would you let me know? I'm interested in
seeing how you finally do it.

Subject: five nice little questions (not urgent, but would be nice to get some answers)
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 15:42:45 GMT

Dear Linux community, wizards and wizards in spe,

I have some questions which are neither critical nor urgent, but i would like
to know some things. I'm sorry if one of this questions appeared formerly in
this group or in the brand newest FAQ since I don't want to force the fellow
news-readers to wade through masses of text more than they already do, but I
have still some serious jobs to do, other than reading news all day.
Please be patient. But now:

1) In "Essential  System Administration", AE. Frisch, O'Reilly, the
   description of SYS V's init and it's runlevels does not match what LINUX'
   init (from which it is said to be SYS V like) tells me. E.g. under LINUX'
   init the runlevel for normal usage is 6. But in EssSysAdm you find
   runlevel 6 described to be for immediate rebooting, and so on.
   Could someone explain it (and perhaps give a complete explanation of each
   LINUX' init's runlevels) ?
   It would be nice if one of the wizards could write a man-page for init
   and inittab, unless this has already been done of course.

2) Does someone have a report about all available filesystems with some
   comparing comments about reliability, speed, pros, cons, special faetures 
   etc.? Where? I think this is something to add in the FAQ (unless this has
   already been done, I haven't the newest, excuse me).

3) Monthes ago, there was a little discussion about memory above the 16MB
   limit on the ISA-bus architecture. Someone told that it would be better
   to give the system all memory (32MB on my box, with AHA 1542B) than to
   create a ram-disk on the upper 16MB or to use them as a swap-device on 
   the upper 16MB.  
   I recompiled the kernel as described (0.99-pl4 --- not the newest but
   STABLE!) ... it was really nice to see "free"'s output, and everything
   ran whitout any trouble, as used before except ... hmmmm ... I found
   everything running 3-5 times slower!!! (<-- this is really true, and it
   is more than "slightly less" performance!) This is not acceptable, so
   I returned to the idea of a swap-device or something like this.

   Question: Either does any solution in this direction exist? (Where? How?)
      or should I retry the same with a newer kernel release? (Linus or one
      of the kernel-wizards might know a good answer :-) but be aware: SCSI !)

4) There were many messages about LILO working together with this-and-that-OS
   but I never read something about LILO working together with an SCSI-
   adapter. Could someone reliably tell me if it is possible to use the OS/2
   boot-manager so that it calls LILO from the menu choice ON AN AHA-1542B ?
                                                           ===============
   I mean, I would like to install LILO on my HD, but only in such a way that
   I need not to fetch all install-disks for all software that was formerly
   on HD.

5) Where to get Xview with a nice little installation-script, all neccessary
   include-files & libs, man-pages, and perhaps some utilities?   

Thanks in advance

Get libc 4.3.3 from tsx-11 under pub/linux/GCC.

Yes. SLS may use a old buggy one. Peter will update it.

cd /lib
ls -l

You will see libc-lite.so.4.3.3 and libc.so.4 is linked to it.

That is because xinit doesn't run with libc-lite.so.4.3.3.

You should update to libc 4.3.3.

I still don't know what you did. Please try

gcc -o foo foo.o bar.o .... xxx.o -lm
                                 ^^^^^
-lm has to be after those modules which use it.

Subject: Serial under X

I'm a linux neophyte, and I need help.

This is my problem:
        Under X(X binaries released w/ SLS 1.0, any window manager)
        I cannot properly manage serial/modem connections.
        When I start a program, such as minicom, the app starts, and
        hangs at the point where the app generally does something with
        the com port( such as initalize the modem).

        Ordinarily, I would just switch to a text console, and
        things work fine, but I have started to use term, 
        and txconn specifically. I cannot tolerate flipping from
        X to text and back to see a serial program refresh! I need
        to see these things refresh in (near)realtime, or txconn
        will not be a useful venture.

This is what I am running:
        SLS 1.0, w/ Xfree 1.2
        386DX-40,8m,120HD
        2400baud internal modem on ttyS2(com 3)

Please help if you can, and let me press a little further by

        I had the pleasure of using this this product last summer, and 
have slowly come to the conclusion that anybody who finds this a superior
product has either never used ANY other UNIX before, is high, or finds
AIX a close second.

        Never before have I used a UNIX so lacking in features, so annoying
to use (even for a SVR? system), and so difficult to get the hang of.

        However, I've been weaned exclusively on SunOS, with HP/UX and AIX
as occasional experiences.

Reply-To: hank@Blimp.automat.uni-essen.de

Hi there!

Since I upgraded to 0.99-p8 (from p7) one of these days, I am
experiencing an instability in the serial driver. After using
X-windows for a while and usually after some heavy work of the system
while I'm playing around with the mouse pointer the mouse starts

                  - behaving as if the ball was muddy (it isn't. Not really)
                  - the the mouse just quits to move. The mouse keys still are
                    o.k., just the thing won't budge a bit.

Leaving X and restarting it doesn't help. So far the only thing I
found was rebooting, which I really don't like too much. 

I'd appreciate ideas!

Hank.

Subject: LILO does not ask for alternative boots

Well, I have installed LINUX, successfuly. The problem is with LILO.
As far as the lilo documentation says it should be possible to boot
from any bootable partition and at boot time this shall be asked to the
user, I have never seen it so I assume it is something like
     which partition to boot from (1,2) ? :
where the user enters his choice. I believe I followed the instructions in
README and have created a install script. The problem I encounter is that no
such question is asked. The systems goes straight to the LINUX boot and does it
Actually there is also a bootable DOS partition which was declared by a
script line
      other=
which is following the linux boot info (in the script file). The interesting
stuff is when I remove the linux boot lines from this script file and leave
the one (other=..) for DOS alone, then DOS bootes automatically.

What is the point I miss? (is it only possible to boot automatically?).
Do I have to do each time an install to get the next boot from the partition
I want?

I will appreciate greatly any help.

Hi , 
I have experimented with the SLS 1.0 release and found it quite 
satisfactory. I used the MINIX file system but the only problem
is its limitations on fs size and filename size. I want to
go for the Ext fs, but am diffident due to the alpha release
and the bug reports. 

Can someone out there give me first hand experience of the EFS? Is
it stable and can I safely put my 540 MB - 486 research machine

Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 20:03:39 GMT

I just got off of the phone with one of Diamond Computer Systems' Tech
Managers (I think).  He seemed to think that the thing Diamond actually
objected to was any other party using their data (driver information) as
a part of any project/product which would be sold.  After perusing the GNU 
License I came to the conclusion that this possibility was not excluded
by the license, and I am wondering if there is a license that exists which
can legally preclude the possibility of sale...

I am considering purchasing a machine with 2 VESA slots and the upgrade to
the Diamond Viper card is extremely attractive in this package deal.  If I
can manage to copyright a driver for Diamond parts which will satisfy
Diamond and GNU I think all could win...

Please help.  Reply any way you feel is appropriate...

   I have written such a program for SVR4. It's free software; you're
more than encouraged to port it to Linux. Probably a trivial job. It
can handle all .au formats except IEEE floating-point and PCM-24.

   For 8-bit u-law, it defaults to emulating the MC14400 in Sun
workstations. If a value is specified for u (micro) or O, then it
switches to idealized North American u-law. It would be nice if it
could do European u-law, too (hint, hint!).

   It can play gzip'ed files (option -z) and can either write .snd
output (optional) or fork-exec a player (default).

   If you or anyone else is interested in porting it, send me a note
and I'll mail you the code. I haven't made it publicly available yet.

Sox munged .wav files last time I used it even though it's supposed to

Thanks to various people who pointed out places to get Linux in the U.S.,
my friend finally purchased it on CDROM.  However, that's not the end
of it.  He asked me to post the following question/problem:

"
Have just purchased Yggdrasil Linux (on CD-ROM) and find that 
I can't install it...  The installation program won't 
recognize the host adaptor on my system.  My machine is a 
Tangent 486/50 with a cached SCSI-2 host adaptor from 
"Asustek" (?).  It normally runs under an ASPI driver.  
The adaptor can't be too bizarre as, last week, I installed 
the latest Windows NT beta which identified it as a 
"BusLogic" unit and had no problem with it.

I phoned Yggdrasil, who said that the installation program 
was only testing for the presence of a port at an appropriate 
address and couldn't offer any further advice.  As far as 
I know, the SCSI configuration is dead standard and I haven't 
changed any of the default settings.

Would appreciate any advice toward getting Linux installed or 
toward getting around the installation program.

Thank you.

rawrite works for any floppy.  For a1 and a2 you need a 1.2M or 1.44M.
They should be "freshly formatted".

        Mount doesn't seem to recreate my etc/mtab file correctly on boot
up anymore.  When I use df, it dies saying it can't read table of mounted
file systems.  I check /etc/mtab and it has in it:

        /dev/hda1       /

        The proc one is ok.  Shouldn't this one read :

        /dev/hda1       /       efs     defaults

        When I run mount rm mtab, and run mount -av agian, it recreates it
ok, but it is not doing it at boot time properly.  My /etc/rc does remove
/etc/mtab, and uses mount -av, but it is not doing it correctly obviously.
 I have checked my etc/fstab file, and it reads:

        /dev/hda1       /       efs     defaults
        /dev/hda2       none    swap

somewhere.  Anybosy have any suggestions?

It compiles nearly out of the box and works well.  I have had one
annoying problem.  When using the monitor, I have to type ^M^J to
get a newline (ie, to enter each command).  "Enter" just gives me "^M"
written on the screen.  If anyone has a fix for this I would be
interested in hearing from you.

This emulator look like a lot of fun.  I still have some old 6510
machine code sitting on some disks in a closet somewhere.  I used to

Subject: X keysyms: where do they come from?
Date: 16 Apr 93 23:08:18 GMT
Reply-To: jkaidor@synoptics.com


   This week, I have been trying make xmodmap define my
scroll-lock key to switch to an alternate keyboard.  Xmodmap
complains that there is no such keysym.  This has lead me to
a more general question:  where do keysyms come from?
BTW, the system in question is Xfree86 1.2 running over
Linux 99pl6.  

    Apparently, keysyms are two things:

    1)  a unique ascii string describing the legend printed
on a keycap.
    2)  a four-byte binary "shorthand" for the system to use
when it deals with the "keycap"

  Now, if there was to be a "Scroll_Lock" keysym in my system,
where would it have to be defined?  In a config file somewhere?
Compiled into the X server?  Into the X client?    And how is the
system to know that this keysym is to be produced when I hit
that particular physical button on the keyboard?

     Here's the sequence I fantasize:

   1)  I hit a key.
   2)  My OS's keyboard driver grabs the scan codes, does it's own
internal state stuff, and outputs an ascii code.
   3)  The X server grabs the ascii code, looks up it's internal,
compile-time-defined, keysym table, and creates a keysym.
    4)  The X server converts the keysym to a keycode using a table
created during xwindow initialization from config files.
    5)  The X server sends the one-byte keycode to whichever client
happens to have keyboard focus.
    6)  The client uses xmodmap data to change the keycode into keysyms,
 taking the modify states into account.
    7)  If the client happens to be xterm, it changes the keysym back
 into an ascii code, and sends it to whichever client happens to be running
inside the xterm.

    If some X guru out there could correct and complete this scenario,
I'd really appreciate it.  I'm especially interested in the names and
locations of the config files involved.

   Step three is especially interesting to me.  It seems like that's the area
I need to poke around in, to get a new key into the system.  Why doesn't
xmodmap know about Scroll_Lock, anyway?!?   Is a server recompile
required, or is there a config file I can goose somewhere?

    I can do without the answers, if somebody can point me to where to
find them.  And don't tell me the X-window FAQ, I've been through it.
Perhaps somewhere in the "mit-4" documentation tree?  What about
a book at the bookstore?  This is important enough so that I'd be
willing to spend $30 or so to find out.

I have added some kind of GUS support to the sound driver for Linux. It
supports currently just the wave table synthesizer of GUS. It seems to
be reliable but there is couple of problems. The first is that the driver
under construction and there will be some kind of incompatibility problems
between versions (this version is just a pre pre pre alpha version). The
another problem is lack of applications which support GUS. There is some sample
programs included with the driver (for example a simple .mod -player).

The driver can be found at klingon.epas.utoronto.ca
(pub/pc/ultrasound/util/unix).

You are wrong about the Internet Worm.

"There were 3 methods used by Robert Tappan Morris to accomplish unauthorised
access to machines and multiply his worm.

1. Try to run a remote shell using rsh. Some machines  will permit access
using rsh with out any other authentication. If this worked then  the shell
uploaded the worm program and continued to infect other machines.

2. Used finger. The worm would finger a site with a specially crafted
536-byte string as the parameter. This string overflowed the daemon's 
buffer and overwrote its stack. There was a bug in the daemon at the time
which did not check for overflow. When the daemon returned from the procedure
it was in at the time it got the request it returned to the procedure inside
the 536-byte string on the stack. This procedure tried to run /bin/sh. Thus 
allowing access.

3. Used a bug in the mail system, sendmail, which allowed the worm to mail
a copy of the bootstrap and get it executed.

Once the worm was running on the new machine it would try to crack passwords
and gain access to other machines perhaps even cycling back to the same machine
at some time thus creating multiple copies of its self." (PG. 184, 
Modern Operating Systems, Andrew S. Tanenbaum)

It's no joke. The program enables you to emulate a C-64 under XWindows.
There are some real sick minds out there...

Anyways, I have also been tinkering with it to get it to run under linux.
I still have an old 64 at my parent's place, and over Easter, I transferred
the kernel and basic to disk. A friend and I compiled it on the sun,
but we have yet to try it out.

I also have a c64 emulator for a PC; it is really cool. It remaps the

Only take the actuell kernel 0.99p8 or even 0.99pre8,
because the AHA 1542 C will need some patches when you have an older kernel.

That should be that you won't be able to run 4.0, but you should be able
to run 3.2.  I haven't been getting much sleep lately -- CS classes,
programming for work, and hacking Linux have all taken their toll. :)

BTW, I own both versions and would be willing to sell them, only becuase
Linux is so Cool :).  The two versions are against one license, so you 
would be legally bound to run only one or the other version of the OS, at
least at the same time.  (No copies on different computers.)

If you're interested, make an offer.  I'd need to verify that this is legal
under MWCs license (i.e. transfer of license).

Date: 16 Apr 1993 18:48:48 GMT

Although I had all kinds of trouble with Maxtor HD, I managed to get Linux
(SLS) installed except one diskette x4. The problem is when I do
sysinstall -disk x4, it starts to install and then within 10 seconds,
it stopped reading from floppy drive. How do I know? I know it because
there is no the normal sound generated when reading from the floppy.
However, there is no error message whatsoever. It just simply hanged there.
I tried download the x4 from ftp site again to another floppy and got the
same result. I had no such experience with other diskettes. It will be
a shame if I can't get this x4 installed since I have spent so much effort
to get this thing going :). I wonder anyone has experienced samilar problem
before and know how to fix it. Thanks in advance.

Hello fellow Linuxers

I am happy to announce that the Commodore ETHER-16 PLUS COMBO (and by
implication the ETHER-16 PLUS) work with the standard Linux kernel ethernet
driver code. The card supports four operational modes one of which is WD Plus
mode (it also does NE1000, NE2000 and its own mode) and it works great. I
had tp move three jumpers to get it work, first to change its mode (see above)
another to change its IRQ from 3 to 5 and finally the jumper to switch from
twisted pair to cheapernet. After that I had fun with the networking support
code due to a nice "little" mistake in my SLS release. In the UK this card
is sold by NETLAND(UK) Limited and is sold by them as purely the "NETLAND
Combo", they don't mention Commodore in the advert in case people were
worried about getting an Amiga by mistake :-) 

I may point out that I don't work for either Commodore or NETLAND, I'm just
chuffed to find a suitable card thats cheaper than the SMC Elite 16 in the UK.

I've got a bit of a problem here...I just compiled the 0.99 patchlevel 8
kernel and installed it (and re-installed lilo) and when I reboot, lilo
loads the kernel fine, and Linux starts up fine and gets to the Login:
prompt, but thats where my problems start: no matter what I try to login
as, the system waits for a second and redisplays the login prompt again.
If the account that I'm trying to use has a password, I do NOT get a 
password: prompt.
This is only a problem under my newly compiled 0.99.8 kernel...when I 
boot up my old 0.99.3 kernel (from lilo or from floppy) everything works
fine.
"halt" at the login: prompt DOES work, strangely enough...its about all that
does.

Suggestions?
Thanks!

or so hours in on writing drivers for these beasts if I just knew where to start.

put a weitek P9000 (the heart of the viper) in the system for you. If we can't get
help from Diamond, maybe Weitek can shed some light on the problem ???

My system should leave beautiful downtown Nampa Idaho next week, after they get

more direction and motivation when it arrives on my San Gabriel doorstep.

also using a Qume 835 SVGA monitor)

Also, cat file > /dev/lp1 starts my HP Deskjet 500 printing but it
will print a line, spew out an empty page, etc.  Are there drivers
for this printer or any special configurations I need to do?

  I did the same thing and had no problems.  A number of people wrote
to me to state that there is a gcc bug involving initializing static
arrays which causes tif_fax3.c to require ~30M of memory (real and virtual).
[The amount of memory claimed as required varied from message to message.]

I have warned you in c.o.l. Please dig out my old article. I may miss
something here.

1. Get Rick Sladkey's mount 0.99.6. It is in mount-0.99.6.tar.Z and
   utile-1.4.src.tar.z from sunsite or tsx-11.
2. Remove any
        rdev > /dev/mtab
   from /etc/rc.
3. List / partition in /etc/fstab.
4. Add "mount -av" in /etc/rc or somewhere like that.
5. Always provide a fs name in /etc/fstab.


After rebooting, you will be fine.

flex also has many additional features that lex can't touch, such as the
ability to split a grammar into 'sections' using start conditions. You can
use the BEGIN(xx) keyword to start working on section xx of the grammar, 
where only certain rules are matched against.

Take a look at the flex man page for more details.

I had stopped looking into Linux, hoping that things would 'become more
stable'. Now, after a few months, I downloaded the most recent SLS
distribution, but, alas, I still cannot get tcp/ip to work! 

This is inspite noticable 'improvements', like my Elite16 configuration
is being recognized by the system on bootup (hence no need to rebuild the
kernel, I suppose).

I believe I followed the instructions step by step, i.e. I edited the
configuration files. But when I type 'ftp <IP number>' I get 'Network 
unavailable'. I even don't know how to find the problem, or what details
to report here to may-be get help.

Notes: 
when running hostcvt-build I get 
'could not find file for router (=add <IP number>)'
where the <IP number> is the one that I had inserted in the configuration
file as our default router (on the line that has the entry 'router').

Running hostcvt.build also destroys my entries for nameservers in the
file resolv.conf, and puts in my local host's IP number.

Strangely, 'shutdown -r now' leads to shutdown but for reboot I have to
reset, or powerdown. Ctrl-Alt-Del does not work.

  And what possible use would such a person have for Unix?  This is
certainly a legitimate point, but it has NOTHING to do with Unix ports,
which necessarily require a certain sophistication on the part of the user
that is lacking among the vast majority of Mac users.

        What version of cron is the one in SLS based on?  I'd be
interested in getting the sources, but not the binaries...there is
a bug with the one in SLS that locks up 'mail' because it uses a
-d qualifier for it.  I ended up getting rid of /bin/mail and linking
elm to it, but it still exhibits the same symptoms.  I ended up
recompiling vixie-cron the last time and got rid of the -d, and
it works great.

        Isn't SLS just using vixie?

Greetings,

   I'll start off by saying that I don't think this site (rtsg.mot.com) is
getting all of the c.o.l.a and c.o.l messages.  Apparently sometime recently
someone asked if MSDos 6.0 and Linux were compatable.  Yesterday I saw a
couple (nasty) responses to the question, but I never saw the original post.
I just checked today, and I didn't see any discussion of the question.

   So, I'll ask the questions this time:

        - Is MSDos 6.0 fully compatable with Linux?

        - If I run the new MSDos 6.0 'dblspace' command, will Linux still be
          able to mount, use and run MSDos programs ?

        - Has anybody tried this, or am I going to be the guinea pig?  :-?  :-)

   I'll keep watching c.o.l, but feel free to email me your response as
well.

   Thanks.

   ( Please route MSDos flames to /dev/null )

Could anyone help me with the following problem?

1.      I have OS/2 2.0, DOS 5.0, and I just install Linux. I followed
        the steps shown one the FAQ, but I still can't boot Linux from
        my Hard Drive. I put Dos and Linux at the primary drive,(also
        OS/2 Boot Manager) and OS/2 at the logical drive. When I tried 
        to boot Linux from OS/2 Boot Manager, the error message show:
        "Selected drive not formated, please try another one."

        I don't where I went wrong; does anyone successfully boot
        Linux under OS/2 Boot Manager?

        BTW, When I use /etc/lilo/lilo -c -b /dev/hda4 -v -v /image
        the message shows that I didn't have a valid LILO signature.
        any clue about this?
        I tried /etc/lilo/lilo -c -b -i /etc/lilo/boot.b /dev/hda4 -v -v /Image
        It still doesn't work.

2.      I got my X386 window and a working mouse, but there is nothing 
        in the window, so I hit the Ctrl-Alt-BackSpace, and the message

Thank you.  I'd been wondering what drugs his informant was doing :-)  Mind
you, my background is almost exclusively System V --- and the SVR3.1 systems I
worked with for several years before encountering SCO "Unix" were far, far
better than that purported SVR3.2.  Not to mention far more compatible with
both System V and (to a limited extent:  no networking with it) BSD software.
(Unfortunately, it predated POSIX, so there was no compatibility there.)

Nicely packaged, expensive spam is still spam, folks....  :-)

As far as "annoying to use", that's clearly a matter of one's experience.  I
started with System III and moved on to System V when it came out; SunOS4 has
been a real "trip", and I'm looking forward to our installing Solaris 2.1 so
the system will behave as God intended :-) :-) :-) [and I say again for the
humor-impaired:  :-) ]  Let's leave the *ix religious wars to the small-
brained, shall we?

Speaking of PC power consumption.
I wondered about mine so I measured it.
80485-50 with 16Meg ram and 3.5" IDE drive pulls 65W.
this is in a 6 year old case amd power supply, the newer supplies may be
better or worse.
I would leave the monitor off.
laser printers tend to pull a huge amount of power.
My machine at home would cost me $3.40/month.

Well, here is a suggestion:

Let each filesystem be mounted with or without access daemon support
(with for flexible security, without for speed).  If the kernel
detects a permission mismatch, it will call up (through some standard
interface) `accessd' which (of course) runs as root.  It informs
accessd of uid, gid(s) and filename, and accessd returns the
permissions approved to the kernel.  Alternatively `accessd' could be
a part of the kernel, but it *would* be bloat.... 

I would suggest the accessd database is simply a (collection of)
file(s) to which only root have access (by the traditional permissiona
bits).

Of course any such proposal must be carefully examined, especially the
interface between the access daemon and the kernel (/dev/access 600
root maybe).

Subject: linux shared libraries often incompatible
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1993 20:51:50 GMT

Linuxers:
I have had some problems recently in trying to use binaries that I
have downloaded from tsx-11 and sunsite. This is almost always due
to incompatible shared library versions. Now, while I think that
shared libraries are great for saving space, distributing executables
linked with them without source code isn't working for me. It probably
isn't working for some others too. My Linux installation is based on
an SLS release about 2 months old, and already there are lots of apps
that I can't use. So I'd like to propose a solution. 

When you post an original app or a port to the net either (1) include the
sources and a makefile, or (2) distribute a set of unlinked object files
and include the link command in the README.linux file.

I think that this would work in most cases. And I sure would be able to
use more software.

Please give me some feedback on this. Otherwise, I think Linux is the
only operating system worth having on your PC (and I have used DOS, OS/2,
Windows, Coherent, and Desqview/X and Linux is the only one that has
lasted on my hard disk more than 3 weeks). I'm getting really snappy
performance running a 40MHz AMD 386 with 8 Megs RAM and an 8 Meg swap
partition. I've got X11 with the openlook window manager, and I feel
like I'm using the SUNs back at work (well, almost :-)). Count me as
another "satisfied customer".

You can still do this ...

Why don't you simply create a crontab entry that shuts your system down
at (let's say) 5:00, and set your timer to shut the computer off at 5:30?
cron should be able to run shutdown fine.

I want thank the various people that jumped up to help. I was going to 
send private replies, but I lost all of their address when I hung the POP
server/client that I was reading the mail on. 

In case anyone is interested:
My telnet in and out's were hanging and I could figure out why.

The suggestions/ideas that I got were:

1. Upgrade to the 4.3.3 libs. 
        I tried this and it seems to help a little(less frequent hangs).
2. inetd is hanging, so the only option short of rewriting/fixing it my self
is to wait. 
3. The kernel cannot handle fragmentation. My options are the same as #2.

Those ideas are helpful, but my system still hangs. However, it seems that I 
can telnet out properly and remain connected only a freshly booted system.
Telneting in still hangs, but it takes a lot longer now. FWIW: I notice 
that there trying to get a listing of the TCP sockets resulted in an 
error message of: too many sockets for netinfo to handle. This is from
the proc-netinfo patch. It would appear that the kernel is overload
from the list of 'stale/unfreed' sockets. Any ideas/suggestions?

Again, thanks.

I received this through e-mail (original author unknown) and I thought everyone
would enjoy the humor...and decry the underlying truth in it...

Monday, 10 AM -- Chicago, Illinois -- Start-up software developer
Cuisine International announced CUISINENET, the first working program to
seamlessly integrate word and food processing.  Called a breakthrough for
small restaurants and snack bars, Cuisine Chairman Mark Meigs confidently
predicted sales of thousands of copies with shipments soon to begin.

Monday, 4 PM -- New York -- Cuisine International shares closed sharply
higher on announcement of new CUISINENET product.

Tuesday, 9 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Chairman William H.
Gates, III announced that Microsoft Food for Windows would soon enter
beta testing.  Gates described the product as the first of a projected
family of products to include Food for Windows, designed for small
commercial dining establishments; Personal Food for Windows, designed for home
kitchens; Portable Food for Windows, designed for lunchboxes; and, of course,
at the high end, Food for Windows NC (Nouvelle Cuisine) designed for large
institutional dining rooms.  Asked by a reporter about
CUISINENET, Gates said that he had never heard of the product, but was not
surprised by it, because the software business is highly competitive, and
Microsoft has to compete on the merits with many strong competitors, as the
FTC had recently concluded.

Tuesday, 3 PM -- Chicago, Illinois --  An angry Mark Meigs showed
reporters a copy of the nondisclosure agreement signed by Bill Gates, under
which Cuisine International had informed Microsoft a year earlier about plans
for CUISINENET.  Meigs said that in hindsight, he should never have signed the
agreement, as the only thing he learned from Microsoft was that Gates was
considering making changing to Windows.

Wednesday, 9 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates
announced that Microsoft would soon publish specifications for the
Windows Open Kitchen Architecture (WOKA), a series of design specifications to
permit manufacturers of toasters, ranges, and other kitchen appliances to
integrate their products into the forthcoming Microsoft Food for Windows line.
 Asked about reports of a nondisclosure agreement with Cuisine International
for a similar product, Gates said that the other product was really at most a
niche product, and would probably have less functionality than the
food-related features that Microsoft would be building into the new
Unsaturated FAT File System which would be part of DOS 7.0.  Gates said that
he doubted there would be much interest in a dead-end solution that would not
be able to keep up to date with advances in WOKA.  Gates added that over
11,000 manufacturers of kitchen appliances were already having serious
discussions with Microsoft about WOKA, and that he expected almost all
important eaters of food to standardize on the WOKA environment.

Wednesday, 10 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates announced that he would be giving the keynote speech at the American
Bakers annual convention on "Nutrition at Your Fingertips."  Gates played down
speculation that he would use the Bakers convention to introduce Microsoft
Food for Windows, saying only that alpha testing was proceeding ahead of
schedule, and the product would be shipped when it was ready.

Wednesday, 11 AM -- Redmond, Washington -- Microsoft Corporation
announced that its Chairman, William H. Gates, III, had made a donation of
over $250 of personal funds to the Cordon Bleu to begin an endowment fund
for the Bill Gates Professorship of Advanced Cookery.  The famous French
cooking school confirmed that it had agreed to be a beta site for the
much discussed Food for Windows application sweet.

Thursday, 9 AM -- New York -- PCWeek Magazine reported in a copyrighted story
that it had obtained a copy of correspondence from Microsoft to Cuisine
International, demanding that the small developer of kitchen software cease
using the Cuisine name, as it infringes on the trademark for Microsoft Food
for Windows NC.  Microsoft added that Chairman Mark Meigs would also have to
change his own name as Mark infringed a copyright on the Windows Edit menu,
Meigs infringed the trademark on Meigs Field in Microsoft Flight Simulator,
and Chairman infringed the trademark on Bill Gates's title which he had
acquired with personal funds from Mao's estate.  Also, Microsoft advised that
while the company did not actually have to move out of Chicago, use of the
name on press releases infringed a trademark on Windows 4.0

Thursday, 4 PM -- New York -- Cuisine International stock closed at
0-bid, 1/16-asked.

Friday, 9 AM -- ? -- An anonymous spokesman for an unnamed Midwestern software
developer announced the discontinuation of operations.  Undescribed legal
problems were cited as the reason.  Others speculated that a failure to
appreciate the competitive nature of the software business may have led to the
company's sudden collapse.

Excellent!!!  

I am a new user to Linux, in fact I just got it up and running today!!  I have
performed a base system + X11 SLS install from SLS 1.0 available at TSX-11... 
I have just a couple of questions that I have not found in any of the docs...

1.  When I finally got X configured, for some reason it looked in a dir 

/u/openwin/bin  

for all of the openwin stuff, my install did not put it uner /u, but under /usr
since I gather that /usr is the right place, how can I fix the X* files to
look in the right place??

2.  What is currently available from the install to run on X11??????  I am
still finding all kinds of new stuff...

Thnks to all who have mae this new joy possible!!!!

I'm running X windows on 5 meg + swap space (8 meg) and although it is
slow, it is still quite usable.  I've got a 486DX-33.

 I'll second this.  I have the most recent (as far as I know) SLS
(0.99pl6), and have been tying for a couple of days to get the loopback
stuff working so I can learn about the networking stuff.

I have read the FAQ, the NET-FAQ, and all other documentation I can find.

I have read some stuff a friend has on tcp/ip networking

TCP/IP _should_ be in my kernel, as I recompiled it and marked it to be
enabled.

But I can't get anything to work after following the instructions in the
net-faq.

if I try to telnet to 127.0.0.1 (which I thought was myself) I get back
"tcp/telnet: unknown service"

I get similar responses for ftp, rlogin, and rsh.

What am I doing wrong?  I apologize if I'm just being stupid, but I'm
doing the best that I can...

We're back at the square where we started from.  The main, and most important

that cannot be compromised by the lower level access levels (i.e. unix
file permissions).

I didn't see your first post, so I'm assuming a lot about what
your problem is.

Certainly, -lm (at the end of the gcc command line) is the thing to do.

That should allow successful compilation.

If you subsequently get a runtime error message, then you need to
check to see where the symlink /lib/libm.so.4 is pointing.  If you're
using libc4.3.2, then it should be made to point to libm.so.4.3.2.
This works for me anyway.

Hopefully HJ won't have to correct me.  Others have posted questions
about libm, and his response is usually you need to get libc4.3.x.
But I don't think HJ's instructions say anything about making the
libm.so.4 ---> libm.so.4.3.2 connection.  He probably expects more
from some of us than we're capable of delivering!  I'm going out on
a limb here, so if I'm wrong HJ, please be gentle with me.

: I have a few questions about Linux.  I haven't read a FAQ, so bear with me.

: Does Linux support virtual memory, or once system RAM is used up, crash city?
Yes, Linux does support virtual memory, in the form of a swap partition.  It 
can be made as large as you want, although once you get around 12 megs,
anything more is a waste of disk space: it won't be used.  I run my system
on four megs with a 12 meg swap partition, and it will run X - very slowly,
but I haven't run out of memory yet( X usually likes eight.).
: How stable is Linux?  Is it only good for playing with?
I haven't crashed Linux yet - I'm using the SLS 0.99pl6 release, and it's
very stable.  With the ever expanding amount of _FREE_ applications that are
becoming available, you can do some serious work with it.  It supports
POSIX standards mostly, which means that many apps written for other
compliant platforms often need only a recompile or a minor change to run on
Linux.  It also has support for Sun's NFS, and with a generous hard drive 
and memory, could conceivably be used for a file server on a cross-platform
network  - and for a lot lower hardware cost than a similarly equipped
workstation. 
: Where is Linux available?
Try sunsite.unc.edu or tsx-11.mit.edu.  A few words of advice: while
you're on these site, pick up a FAQ before posting again here - I don't
have a problem with answering you, but many people on this group will flame
you for posting questions that are answered in the FAQ; this forum is really
for posting questions and solutions to problems not listed in the FAQ.  If you
are unaware of where to get the FAQ, it is posted every so often in the
comp.os.linux.announce forum.  After all, that's the whole point of the FAQ - 
to answer starting questions so that bandwidth isn't wasted on needless common
questions(this is a _VERY_ busy group. :-)

I have had similar problems - If you have SLS release
0.99pl6, switch to the /usr/X386/lib/X11 directory.
The file Xconfig.sample contains the standard VESA
timings - cut and paste the timings tables into
your current Xconfig file, replacing the existing
one.  These timings work with the tvga8900c.  Next
make sure that you have the chipset line in Xconfig
set to "tvga8900c" - it won't work otherwise.
Finally make sure that the modes line reads
"1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" - or something
in that order(it determines the order and resolutions
that the card cycles through with the + and - keys).
Note that all of these I use on a 1 meg card - if your
card has less that 1 meg, it will probably support
lower resolutions only, so be careful!!  If you have a 
fixed frequency monitor, be doubly careful - improper
timings can burn it out!  If you have a  
multisync, you don't have to worry as much - it's very
hard to destroy a multisync monitor with improper timings.
One more note: there are two locations in the Xconfig file:
1 for the vga256 driver and one for vga2(mono) - you
should match up the specs mentioned above for both.  The
chipset line need only by stated once.

Hope this helps!                -Jonathan Ward

To get people to read your post and answer your question:

- Read "Linux Documents Explained for Newbies" - posted weekly (see below).
- Please do not post questions answered in the FAQ lists.
- Please do not post "Please send me the FAQ". See below.
- Please do not post "Split this group now". See below.

- Be informative, both in subject line and body. See below.
- Please read the documentation for the program you have a problem with.

- Linux-specific posts only please - Unix, X, C, etc. groups listed below.

For more information read on ...

** Linux Documents Explained for Newbies ** is is posted weekly by Jay
MacDonald. If you can't find it email me or Jay <jay-m@equinox.unr.edu>.

It will tell you about the Linux FAQ, the INFO-SHEET, the META-FAQ, etc.  These
are posted regularly to comp.os.linux and c.o.l.announce, and can be found in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/linux-faq at pit-manager.mit.edu and on the Linux
archive sites. If you can't get them there, try mailing
"mailserver@nic.funet.fi", "mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu" or
"ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com". If you can't get them any other way, e-mail me.

Splitting the group: It's been tried, and all the new groups except .announce
failed. It can't be tried again within 6 months. See the FAQ for details, or
read news.announce.newgroups. If you insist on discussing it, do so in
news.groups (if c.o.l has too much volume already, why make it worse?).

With threaded newsreaders now in widespread use using a good, specific, polite
subject line will get you many more readers. Most people will ignore posts with
subjects like "Linux", "Help", "SLS", etc. Don't shout to get attention.

Put as much information in your post as possible - preferably a brief summary
followed by session transcripts, etc. as appropriate. Include the precise text
of any error messages printed, etc., and appropriate info about your setup.

Linux is a Unix clone running on PCs; X has its own groups. One of the
following groups is is quite likely to be more appropriate for your question:
 Unix:   comp.unix.questions,  .admin,  .programmer,  .shell   etc.
 X:      comp.windows.x,  comp.windows.x.i386unix (for XFree86 etc)
 GNU:    gnu.emacs.help,  comp.emacs,  gnu.gcc.help,  gnu.* generally
 PCs:    comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware
 C:      comp.lang.c

set setnewsids to setuid root (see above).

yes.  you're not set up right, therefore it's broke.
watch for the UUCP-NEWS-MAIL-FAQ which should be coming around in a couple
days in c.o.l., which discusses most of what you mentioned.

ok... RTFF :-)

no, you're not asking too much, but yes...you should read the FAQ.
Also, there are example config files in the /usr/local/lib/{news|elm|smail}
and /usr/lib/uucp dirs that should get you close.  Also read and follow the
README.linux files.

What's in the current SLS works fine if you follow the README.linux files
and the FAQ I mentioned.  The basic problem is that there's no 'news' group
or user in the current SLS, which is something I've mentioned to Peter on
a couple occasions.

Create a news user and group...make the UID/GID whatever's convenient,
then fix the owner.group like indicated above and you'll be in good shape.

Hi there,

I just want to thank all the guys and girls who wrote to me with
solutions...it seems that a few ppl have been in the same sinking boat.

Anyways, I found that EVERY other term client was working fine, tupload
tmon, termtelnet, termftp, even IRC!  TRSH was even working when I ran
it on the remote end (giving me a shell on the local machine)...so I figured
it must be MY trsh binary.  I recompiled it and it flew :) 

Thanks again, ppl.

You are right. I forgot to mention that. BTW, upgrade to 4.3.3 please.
It fixes a lot of bugs and adds a few IEEE 754 stuff.

I also had some problems with smail and make depend. Don't remember how I
fixed them.

I also detected two other problems with bash 1.12:

 - it wouldn't run the Configure script of trn 3.0 (beta). This will be
   fixed in bash 1.13, but the Configure script has already changed so that
   it works with bash 1.12 too.

 - it does something wrong with passing $* from other shell scripts which are
   included by the `.' command. I detected this when INN 1.4 rejected all
   newgroup messages.

>ksh blew on some other kind, it just hang at one place or was that 
>awfully slower than bash.

The pdksh I have (4.7) is absolutely unuseable for running Configure
scripts. Try the following script with pdksh 4.7 with two or more parameters:

        #!/bin/ksh
        echo "$@"

Zsh gives also problems with Configure scripts.

>What shells are available for linux and which type they are.

I use tcsh as interactive shell and bash as /bin/sh substitute because bash
is the more-or-less Bourne shell compatible shell which runs most of the
(Configure) scripts I have.  Running Configure scripts (sometimes >100Kb) is
a real good test for testing /bin/sh compatibility of shells.

Subject: Installing Linux
Date: 17 Apr 1993 09:59:18 GMT



Hello,

I have gone through the FAQ's and all of the recent postings in c.o.l.,
but I still could not solve my installation problem.  

The configuration of my system: 486DX2/66Hz, 16Meg RAM, 240 Meg HD.
I am trying to install Linux 0.99pl7.

The following was what I did to install Linux.

1. Insert the diskette with file a1.test in drive a:, and boot the system.
   Some messages about the loading process appears.

2. The system invites me to login as "root", and I do.  Then, following the
   message brought out by "install.info", I do the following.

3. Issue "fdisk", and use the its commands to achieve the following list
   /dev/hda1       41200 blocks  DOS 16bit >= 32M
   /dev/hda2       197574 blocks Linux/MINIX
   Finally use the "w" command of fdisk.

4. Reboot the system.  I get the following message and the system hangs.
   task[0](Swapper) killed: unable to recover
   Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space
   In swapper task - not syncing

5. Reboot the system, and login in as "root" again.

6. Issue "mke2fs /dev/hda2 197574"

7. Issue "doinstall /dev/hda2"  and use the following options
   Install from floppy
   Drive B 3 1/2 inch
   Install everything (90MB)
   Is /dev/hda2 an Extended FS (2) used instaed of the default minix(n/y):y

   Then the system gives me the following error message and gets back to
   the "#" prompt.  No installation occures.
   mount: mount point /root does not exist
   Error: can not mount /dev/hda2  Did you use: mkfs /dev/hda2 SIZE
   where SIZE is the number of blocks shown by fdisk?


I am desperate to see Linux run on my system.  Any help will be highly 
appreciated.  My e-mail adress is "quantum@u.washington.edu".

Subject: Kernel Panick, PCTOOL's COMPRESS and FIPS
Date: 17 Apr 93 11:52:18


I have

  386/40, 128K Cache, 8MB RAM, 128 MByte HD

On HD are two partitions:
  
  dosfs  on /dev/hda1 (20MB)
  ext2fs on /dev/hda2 (rest)

For booting I use LILO. The versions are SLS 0.99.? and LILO 0.7. 

Because 20MB DOS is more than I need, I wanted to use the just
announced FIPS-system to split the DOS-partition into to 10MB
partitions, from which I wanted to reuse the second one mainly for
/tmp and swappping. In FIPS-README it is suggested to use a common
disk-defragmentor (e.g. PCTOOLS COMPRESS) for preparing the DOS-HD for
splitting and then apply FIPS. 

PROBLEM:
After having applied COMPRESS to the DOS-partition I was not able to
boot LINUX from /dev/hda2 anymore. LILO comes up with the usual stuff
but is not able to mount the root-filesystem. The system hangs with a 
kernel panick (understandable!). 

What I will do today is to boot with SLS's disks a1 and a2 and then
try to analyze the ext2fs on /dev/hda2. Nevertheless: If anyone knows
something about the problem, please post or mail me.

Look on ftp.luth.se, in /pub/amiga/unix/something. (Don't remember the
exact directory...) Unix LhA is there...

Almost all MODs on the Internet are compressed using LhA/LZH because
they originated on the Amiga. About the only places they'll be in
.ZIP format is on PC BBSes.

Oh, well, it's harmless, but assuming you want the correct error return
(EFAULT), you might want to try this patch..  No guarantees - I haven't
tried the above program, but it should fix it.  Your mount() still won't
work, naturally, but at least wrong parameters shouldn't cause a GP
fault.

Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 06:27:20 GMT

        I am about to buy a new computer.  Decisions, decisions...
Well, does anyone have any advice for me?  I am thinking along the
lines of a dx2-66 or 50, with 16 meg of ram, an Adaptec 1542B, and ...

        What else indeed?  No-one seems to be able to really reccomend
any graphics card.  Can anyone here clarify the matter?  et4000?  ATI
Ultra Pro?  Orchid something?

        Has anyone gotten X running on a Gateway with the ATI Ultra
Pro?  That's what they are trying to sell it to me with, and they seem
to think that it might not run with anything else.  (!)  Anyone?  The
compatibility list mentions the gateway systems, but does not mention
the graphics cards, which I find strange...

        Zeos claims that their on-board SCSI is fully
Adaptec-compatible.  Is this so?  The compatibility list does not
mention it.  I am skeptical.  Anyone?

        Any other suggestions are welcome.  Please, someone who is
happy with your system, tell me what you have!  Thanks :)

Even better is a pointer to the patches from the original sources (stating

Also it might be good to have the Programs accept older lib revisions (i.E
all compiled for libc.so.4.3.1 should also run with lib libc.so.4.3.3) or even
better libc.so.4 build programs should be able to run with libc.so.4.3.3.

But it should at least try to run.

Subject: How to increase inodes?
Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 08:01:56 GMT

SLS .99pl6 (A disks), pl4 (rest of disks).  Using the ext2fs.

I get about 1000 newsgroups fed to my system, and find I am running out
of inodes on /dev/hdb1 (my usr/spool/news drive) long before running out
of volume.  I have a 205mb drive mounted as /dev/hdb1, and it shows a
total of 51584 inodes.  If I'm calculating this right, when I ran out of
inodes the last time, using values reported by df: 

1024 * <used blocks> / <used inodes> = around 2850 bytes per inode.

The man page for mkefs says I can specify the bytes per inode with any
number above 1024.  Can I re-make the drive and specify 1024, and what
would be the consequences?  I had thought there was a 65536 (or close
to that) limit on inodes.

Subject: Serial direct connect ttys for > 0.99pl4
From: hamilton@golem.wcc.govt.nz (Michael Hamilton)
Date: 18 Apr 1993 01:56:00 +1200

I've had a few problems with a direct connect vt320 terminal after
upgrading from linux 0.99pl4 to pl8.  Someone else is bound to hit
the same hassles, so...

Here are instructions for getting a direct connect terminal, or PC
acting as a terminal, to work over a null modem cable plugged into a 
ttys? device.  After linux 0.99pl5 was released the changes relating
to ttyS? and cua? devices made this a little more complex than before.

First you need the getty from getty_ps.  You install as per
instructions, and then add/replace the entry to your /etc/inittab
for the terminal, here's mine:

ttys2:vt100:/etc/getty_ps ttys2 9600

A slight aside: I normally run the poeigl getty (AKA agetty) and
because I've just started using getty_ps, I called it's getty getty_ps
so that I can continue to run the poeigl getty on the consoles (I'm
playing it safe).

You need to use getty_ps for the terminal so that you can use a
/etc/gettydef file to decscribe the necessary tty settings for a
direct connect terminal.  Here's the only entry I changed in the
default getty_ps /etc/gettydef file on my system:

# default entry:
#
9600# B9600 CS8 CLOCAL # B9600 SANE -ISTRIP CLOCAL ECHO #login: #9600

The most important of the tty settings is CLOCAL, which tells getty_ps
to turn off modem control signals.  If you don't specify CLOCAL
getty_ps and poeigl login (I haven't tried other logins) will hang
waiting for a modem carrier on any kernel on or above 0.99pl5.

This is all I needed to do.  But it take a little while to work out
what to do with the various getty, tty and device options.  "The Unix
System Administration Handbook", by Nemeth, Snyder and Seebass put all
the pieces into place, I just wish I'd consulted it a few hours
earlier (a great book).

Where I got my sources:

     sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/linux/system/Serial/getty_ps2.0.6b.tar.z
     ftp.daimi.aau.dk:/pub/Linux-source/poeigl-1.15a.tar.z  

P.S. I initially got around the getty/login hang problems by running
getty/login on a cua? device.  But I use tcsh, and tcsh calls tcgetpgrp()
in libc.  tcgetpgrp() doesn't like cua devices (libc 4.3.2) although
an ioctl() call to do the same thing does work.  tcgetpgrp() returns
an invalid file number, possibly because it doesn't know that the
major device number of 5 (for cua? devices) are tty's.

Should some of the above be an FAQ?

It's late, I starting to ramble...

Date: 17 Apr 93 14:01:34 GMT


Hello,

   I'm thinking of buying a Linux box, and for several reasons, the best machine
that seems to be within my price range is a Compaq Prolinea 50/240 with a Compaq
Localbus graphics agcelerator (50/240 = 50 MHz 486DX2, 240MB Hard disk). 
   Question : Will Linux run on such a machine ?
   Has anyone had any bad experiences with such hardware in the past ?

   Chipset compatibilities I'm not sure about - my local PC dealer has the brains
of a stunned haddock and can only give me Compaq's publicity stuff which isn't
very useful. I'm buying this machine primarily for use as a UNIX in general and
Linux in particular box, and don't much want to wind up running Wordperfect on
it !
   Any help would be greatly appreciated. I can't see it on the Linux
Compatibility list & I can't seem to get at the cwxi FAQ :-(.
   Please reply by E-mail to rrw1000@phx.cam.ac.uk [NOT rrw1000@cl.cam.ac.uk].
Thanks in advance.

There are two EISA SCSI adapters supported by Linux: UltraStor 24F and
Adaptec 1742.  24F support isn't in the core kernel sources or SLS, but is
in the Yggdrasil product.  Source code is in:

I only have 16 MB in my system so I haven't verified that the 24F driver

Hi all you linuxers.  

I am trying to find out if anyone has ported dirt to linux yet, 
and if they would be so kind as to point me to a binary, or
just provide me with diffs.

Thanks a bundle.

OK - I'll do a service since I am using bandwidth ;-)

For those who wonder, dirt is a user interface builder for X.  Allthough
the author (Richard Hesketh = rlh@ukc.ac.uk) will probably have me
fried for this:  it's sort of like a ResEdit for X.  I haven't tried it
out yet, but it looks interesting, and I want to know if someone else

Depends on what you're doing.  I have 8MB and two 16MB swap partitions
(okay, THAT's overkill) and I've seen 20MB of swap used up when doing
some intense image processing while running X.  I've seen compiles of
files that have a lot of static data (like a large bitmap) use up 10MB
of swap.  For what I do, I'd recommend _at least_ 12MB of swap.

Subject: Advice on setting up Linux box on LAN
Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 16:37:00 GMT


I hope to set up a PC as a full time Linux machine over the summer.  I
also hope to set up a (very) small LAN (the Linux machine and a DOS box).
However my practical knowledge of LANs is very limited, so I've a few
questions:

   What recommendations would you make on both the spec for the 
   Linux machine and the networking hardware (bear in mind that
   I don't _need_ mind-blowing performance, just a cheap price-tag) ?

   What do I need (on both machines) to be able to access the disk
   in the Linux machine from the DOS box ?

   What do I need to be able to use a printer connected to the
   Linux machine from the DOS machine ?
        
   Is it possible to directly access a modem on the Linux machine
   from a terminal program on the DOS machine (ie without going
   through something like Kermit or pcomm in Linux).

   Is it possible to have my modem receive incoming fax calls as
   well as data calls ?

   Anything else you think I should know about ???

Any suggestions would be much appreciated (via email if possible).

Subject: MIT Scheme 7.2 Alpha (I ported it, but...)

I was bored last wednesday night.

I ftp'd the i386 source of MIT-Scheme 7.2 Alpha and compiled it
for Linux. It seems to work ok. I've run some scheme programs inside
it, but haven't extensively tested it.

It compiled under GCC 2.3.3 with jumplibs 4.3.3 with very few changes.
I hacked the makefile here and there, and commented out some SIGBUS stuff,
but that was about it. The source said not even to attempt it unless you
are a C and unix god, but I am neither. Hell, I've taught myself C by looking
at kernel sources.

As I noted before, I haven't extensively tested tested the binaries. I'm
not a scheme person. I literally compiled it because I had nothing better
to do. If anyone else has compiled this and could give me some hints, or if
you would like to help test this, please drop me a line.

I have no plans to release this until it can be successfully tested. I don't
think I have the necessary skills to sufficiently test this on my own.

Journalled file systems belong more under the category "system reliability"
than it does under "system security" (fuzzylogically speaking).  Highly
secure systems that meet requirements for Class A1 or B3 levels include
features such as a reference monitor, which is implemented within the
kernel. Good references on this material can be found in the Proccedings
of the National Computer Security Conference.

IMHO, full fledged system security must be well designed in view of the
whole system.  For Linux, IMHO again, this would lead to system bloating
much too early in the game (Please don't interpret this as a "stop
this talk on security" but more like "ahh, more reference material").

Don't bother with "mconv.c" if your using XFree386 V1.2. Support for PS/2
mice is already there. I had problems getting the PS/2 mouse to work on my
Packard Bell Legend 950. I found that if you use the correct device name in the
Xconfig file it works great.

My entry for the mouse in Xconfig is as follows.

PS/2    "/dev/mouse"

Be sure you have a symlink between mouse and ps2aux in your /dev dir.

Hope this help 8^)

I would suggest the following scheme. Say you port a package foo-1.00.tar.z.
You then could make a package named foo-1.00-linux.tar.z containing the
following:

 - binaries
 - a patch file (context or unified) + Linux specific config files
 - A README file, saying which version of the libraries the binaries are
   compiled with and giving instructions how to compile the package yourself
   (and that includes ungzipping/untarring, patching, putting the config
   files to the correct location, making and installing).

BTW: I ftp-ed a conf/os/linux for smail more than half a year ago from one of
the ftp sites.

This is already the case :-) The problem was that programs compiled with,
say, libc.so.4.3.3 won't run with older versions of the libraries.

The best thing to do is to upgrade your C library regularly. Most people who
make binaries compile the binaries with the latest C library.

Hmm.  Interesting.  e2fsck has been known to hang on me when checking
moderately corrupted file partitions.  My questions:

        * I have the SLS 1.0 release.  Is there a newer e2 suite
          available?

        * Has anyone else had similar troubles with e2fsck hanging while
          checking a suspect partition?

        * Why does the e2 filesystem not shut down cleanly, even with a
          sync?  It seems like e2 partitions require a umount before
          shutting down, lest they get an 'invalid filesystem' error
          when the partition is remounted after reboot.

It seems the e2 filesystem, while nice so long as you don't have any
problems with it, tends to degrade rather quickly once you do.  Once,
when I had a problem with an unreliable SCSI tape controller, I had to
*repeatedly* rebuild the e2 partitions.  e2fsck just wouldn't fix the
filesystems.  Typically, it just hung.

Anyway, my two cents' worth is that it seems that creeping feature-itis
has overtaken robustness as a design goal for the e2 file system.

this doesn't really address your question exactly, but it might be along the
lines of what you had in mind....it doesn't impose limits, as such, but it
will automagically complain to users who are hogging the disk.

one of the best UNIX admin books I've ever seen (and one of the most
recommended books out there) is called ``UNIX System Administration
Handbook'' (by Evi Nemeth, Garth Snyder, and Scott Seebass).

in this book, there is a csh script called spacegripe (Appendix I, pp.
511-513), that will at least complain to a user who is hogging the system.
you could easily modify this to send a copy of the gripe to root, and
notify the user that root has been informed...and is going to be watching
their disk usage.

I can also think of ways to modify it even more to get nastier if they log
on and don't do anything about it (have to look at when they last logged
on and compare it to when the first/most recent gripe message was sent).

btw, if you don't have this book, you need to run (not walk) to the nearest
decent bookstore and get or order a copy.  I paid $34 at Interop (strangely
enough, the receipt is one of my bookmarks in the book), but have no idea
what it runs for at bookstores.

   --jim

PS:  I have no financial interest in this book...I'm just glad I bought it
     at the first Interop I went to (I got them to let me look at a copy
     over breakfast, and after looking through it for about 1 minute, I
     went back to the counter and bought it...as did my co-worker who also
     took a look at the copy I had).  I have, however, met the primary
     author, Evi Nemeth (at the Spring 92 Interop)---nice person.  very
     modest, too (I gathered that she didn't see what all the fuss was
     about over the book, but she likes all the e-mail she's gotten).  btw,
     she mentioned something about a 2nd edition being in the works...no
     idea when it'll be out, but I want it!

Linux will use whatever better in 386bsd. But 386bsd has to
start from scratch, unless you do it yourself. For example,
387 emulation and C library.

And then Linux and the GNU folks will take what 386BSD has done and
restrict it.  Now, isn't that nice....... taking my work and restricting
it.  I always thought that was awful kind of them. (NOT!)

Date: 17 Apr 1993 07:01:12 GMT

I posted yesterday asking for help on my linux communications 
problems, and I had not realized that X didn't support IRQ sharing,
and the mouse on com1 conflicted with the 2400 baud modem on com3

I have neither the time nor the patience to hack IRQ sharing,
so I moved the mouse and lost half my modem functionality. Ah well,
it is well worth it to run xdaliclock remotely(If slowly! Hint: dont ever do
this) Thank you to all who helped me on this, especially Gebran Krikor.


I have one more question for the gurus, or even enlightened neophytes.

I try to spawn a getty to a serial line to support a terminal, and
I encounter difficulties. the getty accepts the login properly, and the 
login process is spawned on the linux box(as revealed by ps), and
the password checking is not handled. Either the password
echos on the terminal and does not process, or it never prompts for
a password in the first place.

This is what I have done so far. I set it(BTW *never* *ever* do this)
so that root can login from the serial port, and then root
or any other id without passwd authentication works properly.
It logs in fine if I dont need to use a password.

I have redirected the input , output, and error for a shell over the serial
line and that works okay,

I have tried the same thing with login, and it exhibits the characteristics
of the spawned getty detailed above. This leads me to believe
that the problem is in login.
Sound good?
Have a fix?

Thanks in advance for all your help.

Subject: Problems with 1542 Rev C
Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 16:58:41 GMT

Has anybody had any problems running linux with the new revision of the
1542 controller - Rev C?

The Rev B board works fine, but when I install the Rev C, it doesn't seem
to recognize that a board is even installed and I end up with a kernel
panic trying to mount root.

I called Adaptec.  They don't even sell the Rev B anymore.  They claim
that the Rev C is 100% downward compatible with Rev B as far as BIOS
calls and hardware registers are concerned.

Does anyone know where the source code to the adaptec driver is available?

Thanks.

Oh btw to complicate matters, I'm runnning Linux on a Bernoulli 90MB
removable cartridge, but that *shouldn't* cause any problems.

I'm currently using both a gus and a pas16 with linux and
Hannu Savolainen's sound driver.  So I can compare them, but I
can't give you a straight answer.  Right now, my gus sounds
better, except for percussion voices, which come out better
on the pas16 -- fm seems to do better at clangy and noisy
things.  Also, I get more polyphonic voices on the gus.  However,
I believe a future version of the driver will support more
polyphany on the pas16 and also 4-op synthesis (the current
version only supports 2-op fm synthesis).  At that point,
the pas16 might sound overall better -- I can't tell.

Now, the driver supports input and output from/to
an external midi port only for the pas16, of the two cards,
but that will probably change, too.

: Which is the best soundcard supported by 386BSD ?

Couldn't say.  If it's the same driver, maybe the same non-answer
would be equally appropriate.

Why are you trying to confuse the issue?  Yes, Linux will (and has)
taken things from 386BSD when it's convenient.  Likewise, 386BSD will
(and has) taken things from Linux.

You make it sound like 386BSD *can't* use code from Linux.  This is
bogus.  It's just very carefully chosen which parts are worthwhile,
which aren't, and which need to be redone.

I've been able to keep up with the new kernel and library releases most
of the time, and have had almost no problems. I missed the actual 4.3
version of the C library, and didn't upgrade when I read about the problems.
After I saw the announcement for 4.3.2 libraries, I upgraded quite soon.
Again, no problems.

I would be interested if you would be kind enough to elaborate on
this.  As far as I know, nothing that Linux or GNU (which have little
to do with each other, except that Linux uses a lot of GNU programs)
has imported has been made available under a different copyright
notice than what the copyright holder (typically the author) has
agreed to.  Anything else would be illegal.

One similar example would be when 386bsd imported Linus' math
emulator: the copyright was changed to the same style that the rest of
the 386bsd kernel uses, when it originally was under the GPL.  (The
change was done with Linus' complete approval, I haste to add.)

(The article I'm replying to might have been a complete flame-bait,
articles of that type usually are, but sometimes I can't resist
answering such articles.  Color me a sucker.)

It is well known how to make crash-proof *and* fairly efficient file

never consider buying a commercial system with an unreliable file

I have installed SLS 0.99pl6 on my 386 and have been looking around in the
system to see what all it can do.  I know you guys probably answer these
questions ten million times a day, but:

1) How can I set up Linux to access serial logins?  I have a modem on
   /dev/ttyS2 (/dev/modem).  How do I set my machine up to automatically
   let users login?  I have the modem set for S0=1 and it will connect fine
   with other modems, but it won't give a login prompt.

2) How do I get UUCP set up?  I want to be able to receive news (10-15
   groups) and mail on my box at home.  I also want to be able to distribute
   news and mail to friends running Linux in my area who don't have
   connections like I do.  I have an account at Denver Univ. I can dial
   into to get stuff from using kermit, but how do I get stuff using UUCP
   and (I hope) cron?

        On this note, I'm curious to hear if there is any plan to make
shared libraries standard in 386bsd...?  I have seen one patch for this
out on the net, but I don't know if many people are using it, and if

Ok, this is OK by me, I just didn't want the "sea-gull" to be *the* Linux

If everybody did that, the GNU copyright would not be a problem. Is
your purpose to let someone make "completely non-redistributable"
stuff? Am I missing something?

You have gave us freedom (Thanks). We have made our decision and you
can get our code for free with some reasonable conditions. Why do you
complain? That is what you ask for. Please blame it on yourself. If
someone did something to your code and didn't tell your about that

No. I am trying to say the "official" 386bsd release is not willing
to use GNU copyrighted code. Of courses, you can make/release your

That means no GNU copyrighted code in the "official" 386bsd release. BTW,

No, my purpose is to make 386BSD completely re-distrubutable, with NO

No, I would not complain.  I believe the work should be in the same vein
as it was distributed.  COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY free.  Not copylefted,
which places  restrictions on its distribution.

The original BSD copyright has been this way, but unfortunately a group of
people take the code, fix the code, and then place restrictions on it.

Virtual memory is much more than just adding some disk space to
physical ram.  Virtual memory without any swap space enabled at all
would still be very useful.

The stdio code that HJ has done lots of work on(and I commend him on
it).  The original code, before he fixed some of the bugs, was originally
distributed by AT&T, but HJ's fixes are now GPL code, so in order to
get working stdio code we have to do those fixes all over in order to
make anything compiled against those libraries ABSOLUTELY FREELY
REDISTRUTABLE.

And I commed Linus, and his work highly for that.  I wish that more of
the Linux people were more willing to do that.  (And to be honest, I
haven't asked very many folks about this).  But, some people believe
with distributing anything but GPL code, because the 'end all/be all'
way to distribute code is to GPL/LGPL it.  I disagree, and am considered
a 'bad guy' because I distribute my fixes w/out any added restrictions
that the original code had.

Is it possible to use an Iomega Bernoulli Box under Linux? How about
Iomega's LaserSafe? (LaserSafe is an optical drive but behaves somewhat
like a Bernoulli Box and uses same drivers.)

I know it might be possible using an Adaptec or other SCSI card but how
about with Iomega's own SCSI card? Anyone tried yet? Thanks in advance
for any responses. E-mail or post are fine.

Packet fragmenetation isn't supported, but otherwise everything

For some reason the man pag refers to SYSVR3.2 curses whilst the library is

There are two variants of curses:  the BSD one, which uses termcap and only
supports standout(), and the System V one, which uses terminfo and has support
for multiple attributes like A_BOLD, etc.  The standard Linux curses is the
BSD one.

There is a port (and general improvement) of Pavel Curtis's "ncurses"
available.  It's still under development, so there may be occasional problems;
for example, I just discovered today that its color support appears to be
hardwired for ANSI terminals (no setf, setb entries).  "ncurses" is based on
the System V curses, so it supports multiple attributes, color, etc.

it's not exactly right:

Apparently the guy who wrote Emacs released it into the public domain.
He made it completely redistributable. As the story was told to me, DEC
Corporation saw Emacs and liked it and decided that they were going to
take it. I don't recall if they just started selling it or if they
somehow "assumed" the rights of emacs. This pissed the guy off... who
decided he was going to write a NEW or "GNU" version of emacs and was
going to reserve the rights just enough so that nobody else could claim
the rights to it.

Now, it really, Really, REALLY angers me to think of these big
corporations taking public-domain and otherwise free software and
distributing it as their own and actually getting money for it. How
DEVOID of work-ethic does some have to be to pull a stunt like that? And
you're saying that you're pleased as punch if DEC can just ftp a copy of
386BSD and start selling it for $500/copy as DEC-BSD/PC or something?!?!

That makes me ill. It really does. When I code stuff and release it to
the public domain, I stipulate that the stuff is free and is free to
modify, but ANYTHING that is derived from my code or that USES the
binaries has to be free as well. I think that the GNU agreement is
something similar to this. Now, if a company wants to charge for
SUPPORT, or if they want to charge a media fee for distribution....
that's okay (SoftLanding does this.... as far as I can tell).

Anyway.... that's what I wanted to say.

Subject: MINIX DEFRAG errors -- trashed all my static libs.

Reply-To: sdh@po.CWRU.Edu (Scott D. Heavner)



        Sometime within the last few weeks, I tried defrag-0.4
(at least I think it was 0.4) on my minix fs.  I did everything
from a floppy with the root partition unmounted.

        Everthing appeared OK, I got no error messages, but then
some of my binaries stopped working, I replaced my libc.so.4
and everthing was OK.  Then I noticed some X apps weren't working,
they all crashed with segmentation faults, so I replaced all
the static X libs. Eventually, I found something wrong with all
my static libs and had to replace them all.  It was just a 
real pain trying to figure out waht went wrong.

        Is there a reason behind this?  Should one never defragment
a static lib, or should there be a better defragmenting system
that preserves whatever holes might exist in the libs.

   You are full of shit.  The `official' release include GCC, GDB, GNU
   tar, and several other pieces of GNU code.

I believe HJ may have spoken a little hastily.  I believe, however,
that the Jolitz' have said they do not want any copylefted code in the
*kernel proper*.  Hence, Linus was asked (or volunteered?) to make the
math emulation code available under a BSDish copyright, which he did.

I remember a flap in the 386BSD community a little while ago about an
improved serial driver (?) that the author had copylefted, which
angered a good many people, and the author had to loosen the copyright
to the BSDish form for it to be accepted.

Just trying to do a little interpreting and clarifying, and not
leaping into this absolutely stupid and childish series of flame wars.

The finger that comes with SLS (and the finger on sunsite) is broken
in this regard.  To fix it, take the BSD finger code from sunsite,
and the lastlog.h file from the shadow password sources, remove
the #ifdef linux from around the code in finger to read the lastlog
file, and compile.  You'll probably have to remove a reference to
ll_host, or some similarly-named field, since the shadow code isn't
writing that field to /usr/adm/lastlog.  I may look at that at some
point in the future.

I'd like to point out that what you saw wasn't even close to a panic -
it's just an ordinary debugging message that means that the kernel
hasn't done enough checking.  In some cases, that can be problematic (if
this happens in a interrupt handler or if it happens in a place where
the kernel has busy resources), but generally a general protection is
just the equivalent of a normal SIGSEGV that happens to be in kernel
code.  That was indeed the result of all this - just a sigsegv (which
was quite ok - you get sigsegvs in user mode too when you give wrong
parameters to functions) that happened to have some debug information
added to it. 

The debugging messages used to occur with *every* sigsegv in older
versions of linux - I think I removed the user level debug info in 0.97
or so, as it made people nervous to see a register dump when a program
did something it shouldn't have.  So now linux prints out the error
messages only when the problem is in kernel mode (and yes, it should be
considered a bug when this happens, but it's not necessarily a panic()
or even a "real" problem). 

Note that most of these have been fixed a long time ago, so now only the
really bad things result in debugging info - these are usually also
things that actually *do* result in a panic sooner or later (usually
sooner), so yes, there is some correlation with the debugging info and a
panic.  It's just not quite 1:1,

        When speaking at SVNet meetings, Bill Jolitz has repeatedly
stated that he sees 386BSD as a sort of publicly accessible research
vehicle for operating systems.  The 386BSD core distribution is not
designed for the average end user.  Instead, the 386BSD copyright is
unrestricted specifically for the purpose of allowing the results of
386BSD to be assimilated into any other operating system project, such
as Windows, turnkey BSD distributions or Linux.  The public benefit is
supposed to come from this assimilation, not unlike the way most unix
users now benefit from the Berkeley filesystem and networking work.
Assimilating 386BSD software into Linux without Linux having to give up
its copyright policy is more than just allowed; it is specifically the
point of 386BSD.

I don't thinnk you can install any of the distributed packages directly to a 
PS/2. There are patches around for a 508 controller. (I think that is the 
number.) You need to have someone compile these into a new boot disk for you.

The answer to this seems to be a yes and no. I have no problems with net 
programs, another guy 2 floors below me with the same card is getting all 
sorts of problems. I don't understand why though.

Since the serial IRQ handling is inside the kernel and is not

So i would think the Problem lies in the IRQ Conflict on the
hardware where your Mouse Ports are getting Problems with your
Serial card. This is due to some vendors are building unsharable
IRQ lines, and this I thnik is the Problem here.
(Just take a look at the kernel source (kernel/chr_dev/serial.c)
there is the serial IRQ handling done. If the Hardware works
it is able to work with at least the four normal COM Ports
(with COM1 & 3 on IRQ 3 and COM2 & 4 on IRQ 4) Probably your Modems
or your Serialcard is not able to handle shared interups.
A soltion would be to put the Modems each on some own IRQ line,
Just check the hardware if you are with Open Colector or Totem Pole

I think what's griping Nate is that if someone contributes code to
a LIBRARY under GPL and someone else creates software and uses that
library to compile said software of their own creation, they are not permitted
under the GPL to sell it. It's kind of like Borland coming along and saying
that because you used TurboC to compile software, they are entitled to
a share in any profits since you used their libraries. While I agree that
it would be totally reprehensable for anyone to sell the libraries, I do
not think it is right to tell someone that wrote 10,000 lines of code
that may have 1 or 2 calls to libraries that are under the GPL that
they are not allowed to try to get recompense for their efforts. IMHO, if
I release something into the public domain, my concern as to the use
made of it has ended. 

This is my opinion. You are free to use and distribute it provided you
do not charge for the distribution. If you should, however, derive an
opinion of your own from mine, you may charge whatever you can get for
it. :-)

ncurses is missing about half of the color routines (no HLS, and it assumes
ANSI emulation --- it doesn't accept the "setf" and "setb" terminfo codes) and
*all* of the printer entries in terminfo (which, luckily for you, aren't used

Okay, sorry.  My experience has always been that kernel GP faults are
immediately followed by panics... even once or twice under Linux, but with
older kernels.

In any case, I still think it's improper for the kernel to get into trouble
over bad user-mode actions (within limits; some things can't be caught, but
most of those are reserved for root), but I'm not complaining about the kernel
so much as HJ's assumption that the fix is just to use prototypes in user-mode
code.  I've seen programs which scramble their own memory and then execute it
(jump through an NFG function pointer) crash systems in the past, and there is
even a program available which deliberately tries to do that to test the
resilience of a kernel.  (I hear that most commercial *ixes fail the test....)

I was trying to "fix" the permissions on my system (SLS 0.99pl6).  I 
changed 'login' and a couple more programs to non-suid.  
 
I rebooted my system and it came up as normal - almost.
rc ran, called rc.local, which in turn called rc.net.  All of the drives 
are mounted, swap partition is initialized, and the date prompt is 
echoed on screen.  However, just 
before giving the login prompt, I get the error messages 
        'init: exec failed'
9 times, then the system reboots.  
 
I logged in with a fresh diskette, changed the permissions of login back 
to suid root, commented out rc.net - same thing.
                                                  
I also commented out rc.local from rc, no luck.
 
Apparently, it is something at the very end of the boot/initialize 
process which dies. I can't figure out what it is.

Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 23:27:33 GMT

 I am currently using a "transparent" compression scheme - the tcx program
which was posted a few weeks ago in comp.sources.unix.
 
 TCX compiled clean for Linux, except for a few #define changes in untcx.c .
 
For the time I have been using it, TCX has behaved fine and it saves about
50 % space on my /usr/bin. I can compress heavily used files such as gcc and
p2c (for me:) and it keeps track of the status of the files without a glitch.
 
Based on my testing experience, I would recommend tcx until such time as
someone comes up with an OS-based compression scheme.
 Cheers!

I think someone already suggested this, but it got ignored..

PLEASE look into the structure of the LFS (log file system) written
for the Sprite OS. This is a journalling filesystem. This makes it
absolutely ideal for makeing a compressed file system. (not to mention
that the fact that it is very fast to write to, and nicely crash
resistant). 

The thing that makes LFS so nice is that ALL writes are sequential.
inodes, directory, map blocks, data all get written sequentially into
the log. Makes compression kinda easy. If you byte-align the blocks,
and work with 8K pseudo blocks, then you never need to uncompress more
than 8K to get the data you want.

There was another benifit but I have forgotten it. Oh well. Some other
time.

Well, the way you would do this you would lock the modem's interface
speed to the highest speed your modem can do; in this case, 38400. Then,
you'd use hardware handshaking between the modem & computer, so that the
speed between the modem & computer stays the same, but the people who dial up
to your modem can connect at any speed. Also, 38400 is not a 'real' modem-to-
modem speed; it is actually 14.4Kbps with V.42/V.42bis compression.

Also, the c5,c6,etc. are *not* terminal types; they are id strings for
the processes. They have nothing to do with terminal types. When a user
logs in through getty (getty can dynamically adapt itself to a user's terminal
capabilities), he/she can set the term by doing 'setenv TERM whatever'.

(I hope this did not sound like a RT*M; if it did - sorry)

Well, for SCSI, the major number is 8 & the minor number is the partition #.
I think 'mknod /dev/sda9 8 9' will do what you want. I think you can have
up to 15 partitions; minor 16 is partition 1 of sdb.

Oops. The correct command is 'mknod /dev/sda9 b 8 9'. Sorry.

        Read the manual ... ! You need to put a 'delay = tsecs' in your config
fileand then while the system is booting you wiil see the word LILO pausing for
as many tsecs as you sepcified in your config file. Then if you press any of the
SHIFT CTRL ALT CAPS LOCK or SCROLL LOCK you will see a prompt that looks like

as of OS 4.1.2, and - Linux V0.95 =8). The list of those who bit the

Subject: how to grind your system to a halt .. vitrual mem, tcsh
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 03:21:02 GMT


I happened upon an interesting discovery the other day.  If you're
curious, try this...

in tcsh, hold down a key for a while; let the key repeat until the buffer
is full (no more keystrokes will be accepted).  Then, hit return.  You
should probably run top in another virtual terminal before you hit return.
Then, watch tcsh's memory usage climb and climb and climb, until the 
system grinds to a halt (swap space fills up, then the remaining space
in the buffer cache gets eaten until the system can no longer function).
You might also want to set up an infinite loop that calls free, so you
can watch your memory usage directly.  Careful, 'cause the only way out 
of this is to cycle the power (if you let things get out of hand enough).
I let it run until it took 10 minutes between free's updates... 0 swap,
300 or so cache, 40 free.  Yikes!

I didn't check into the reason that tcsh eats up so much memory.  But,
it may be important that I am running with libc4.3.3.

If you're curious, bash is a bit more graceful... segmentation fault

I did this with 8 M of ram, and 16 M of swap (so don't tell me to increase 
my swap :)  I just found it interesting, and a _huge_ security hole
(unless you want other users to halt your system).

Just an observation.

Looking on sunsite, I found a rather large number of inits. Unfortunately, I
have little enough experience with UN*X systems administration (read: none)
that I find it difficult to figure out which one is best for me. Would it be
possible for some kind soul to offer some advice to me and other quasi-newbies
on making this decision?

I will summarize email responses.

Thanks!

Could anyone help me with the following problem?

1.      I have OS/2 2.0, DOS 5.0, and I just install Linux. After 
        followed the steps shown one the FAQ, but I still can't boot 
        Linux from my Hard Drive. I put Dos and Linux at the primary 
        drive and OS/2 at the logical drive. 
        Here is the command I used to build the Image file: 

        etc/lilo/lilo -b /dev/hda4 -i /etc/lilo/boot.b -v -v -v /Image
        
        Everything seems fine so far, but when I try to boot up( after
        I added it to the Boot Manager) from the hard drive, system 
        hangs during the boot procedure. There are some differences
        when I load Linux from A dirve:

I believe that if you write LIBRARY code using the GLPL (or whatever)
you impart the ability to developers using your libraries the ability
to sell or freely distribute "derived works".  This is different from
the standard GPL, which is intended to protect applications.  This
can be considered analagous to Borland allowing to freely restribute
code containing calls to the Turbo C libraries, but prohibiting you
from distributing code derived from reverse engineering Paradox.  The
assumption is that Library code *should* be freely redistributable, at
least insofar as part of an executable.  But, I think it's fair to expect
developers of applications to protect their apps. 

As far as Linux goes, I'm not sure.  Some of the stuff is "library" code, but
other stuff should be considered "application" code.  

In any case, the idea is to protect not just the author, but the general
public (i.e. users) from getting ripped off by someone who'd steal code, change
a line or two, and charge exorbitant rates for it.  If say DEC were to "borrow"
the Linux or BSD kernel, change a few lines (like maybe the copyright...)
and market it, the people who developed it would feel *very* cheated.  GPL
protects against that sort of thing.

This thread has degenerated into a meaningless stream of name-calling.
For the life of me I have no idea what this has to do with Linux.

As for the topic, there is nothing appropriate to say about it 
except take it somewhere else. This kind of rhetoric does nothing other
than provoke normally reasonable people into emotional responses.

May I suggest the creation of a newsgroup to handle this discussion:

I suppose you are referring to BSDI and BSD/386?  Or do you mean Sun?
Or DEC?  FSF/GNU protects your freedom. The FSF fights the software

Why do you need Linux developers to fix BSD code? It seems that
the logical choice would be to take the fixes from BSDI. They
are using the same NET/2 sources as you. BSD/386 is available  with
source code. If the NET/2 sources had been protected by the GPL
then you wouldn't have various BSD factions re-inventing the wheel,
duplicating efforts, wasting time, stalling progress. The purpose
the GPL is to prevent this lunacy. The GPL encourages the sharing
of improvements, a good thing in my opinion.

I have the same thing, but I've been too lazy to track it
down.  Basically, somewhere the terminal program is failing
to translate CR's to LF's.  All you have to do to log in
is use ^J ( ctrl-J) to terminate the lines instead of CR or
^M.  Most programs either put the terminal back into CR to LF
translation, so once you are logged in, CR works for almost
everything.

The "tools" argument is valid but it is not the whole story - it seems to
me that there is an important philosophical (dare I say political?)
component to this whole discussion - a very rough analogy: A car with a
polluting internal combustion engine might (?) get you to work every day
faster than the train but is it a good idea to use the car? Is not the
general good better served by using the train?

I am not going to argue the merits of corporations like Apple, IBM,
Microsoft etc but on balance, with all things taken into account, surely
open systems are better for the general good? To be specific: In
Australia, Macs are 100% imported but some IBM compatibles have up to 50%
Australian content in their manufacture - is the marginal improvement in
productivity for some computer jobs (by using Macs) worth the substantial
negative effect on the country's current account deficit? 

I know this is getting further away from the main topic for discussion for
this newsgroup but I had to put my 2c worth in.

Actually, this completely depends on what you plan on doing with linux.
I run a 486-33, with 8M, and 16M swap and can run out of memory easily
just by working long enough. I have a couple of applications that use 2-3M,
and I don't use X.

Compile something large on top af that and you can quickly run out. Remember,
with a unix style system more is always better when it comes to memory.
This is my current average right now, with 6 VC's open, and 1 telnet
connection.

             total       used       free     shared    buffers
Mem:          7340       5308       2032        572       1440
Swap:        16376       5896      10480

This is during compilation, so thats why so much free shows up, but it
would be pretty easy to run up the other 10M as well.

I believe rlimit is not 100% enforced. Maybe it is the time
to do that. You can set hard limits in files in /etc. The actual

I was thinking it would be great as my Linux partition could be larger and

Linux handles RLIMIT_CORE, RLIMIT_STACK, RLIMIT_DATA, and on ext2
file systems RLIMIT_FSIZE.  

You're missing RLIMIT_CPU, RLIMIT_RSS, RLIMIT_NPROC, RLIMIT_OFILE, and 
RLIMIT_MEMLOCK.

How about one of the following?
    1)  install 'what' under Linux (what looks at files searching for SCCS
        headers printing them out - hopefully they have version information)
    2)  add an extra field to the a.out to contain a version number.  This
        could go at the end of the a.out structure can might be called
        "version_id" and be 32 bits in length producing a version number of
        the form #.#.#.# where each number can be 0-255 (unsigned).

Option #1 advantages
    1)  just port 'what' to Linux
    2)  ANY ASCII file can have a legel SCCS field meaning that 'what' can
        be run on ASCII files in addition to binary files
Option #1 disadvantages
    1)  multiple output lines meaning it would be impossible to parse the
        output of 'what' to obtain a single version number
        For example a 'what /usr/ucb/what' on a Sun produces:
                        what.c 1.7 88/08/02 SMI
                        any.c 1.5 88/02/08 SMI
    2)  no easy way to assign a version number to a library

Option #2 advantages
    1)  ALL programs can have a version number WITHOUT having to be modified
        like a -v option would require
    2)  Libraries can also have version numbers (done by adding a dummy file
        called __Version which contains the version number)
Option #2 disadvantages
    1)  General ASCII files can't have a version number assigned to them.
    2)  If done the same way that Convex does it 'ld' would have to be modified
        to add a "default" version number equaling the version number of the
        kernel.
    2A) There are other programs which would need to be modified or added
        such as 'vers' and 'install' (see below).
    3)  Would require the version number of a program to be of one of the
        following formats:
                #.#             [major.minor]
                #.#.# or        [major.minor.patch]
                #.#.#.#         [major.minor.patch.rev]
        where all unspecified fields are assumed to be set to zero.  This is
        also an advantage since it forces a set way to represent version
        numbers.

Personally I like #2, though I am biased since I used to work at Convex
and Convex does things like this and IHMO it worked VERY well.  Basically
under ConvexOS you have commands 'vers' which set/viewed the version number,
'install' which had a '-v' option allowing you to set the version during an
install, and a '-v' option for 'ld' allowing you to set the version number
during a compile/load.

If #2 is something that is implemented I would be willing to write 'vers'.

Hello,

After my failure to install linux from a1.test, I tried to start from
a1.  The followings are what I did.

1. Insert a1 in drive a: and boot the system.  The following message appears.
   Linux version 0.99 pl6-26
   Loading 655360 bytes to ram disk

2. Insert a2 in drive b: (I assume a2 is what the "utility disk" prompted by the
   installation program.) 
   Drive b: starts to run forever.  And the following message shows up.
   
   task[0](Swapper) killed: unable to recover
   Kernel panic: Trying to free up swapper memory space
   In swapper task - not syncing

My system is a 486DX2/66 with 16 MB RAM and 240 MB HD.  It is a VESA local
bus machine.  Is my hardware suitable for Linux?(I am asking this because I
found some of the documents say that Linux does not support VESA, but some
otehr documents say that it does. ..... I have been reading all of these docs,
they are too many for me to remember from which doc I read what.)

I have been very frustrated by this installation.  Any help will be very much
appreciated.

For those of you holding off ordering from jana@canrem.com, I just
got the first issue and it is great!  Basically, it looks like the
ftp directories from a mirror site!  However, since this only contains
150MB or so of linux stuff, so some of the neat stuff is missing.  
However, that is why there are 5 more issues in a years subscription.
For the price it is great, if just 2 issues out of the 6 this year are this
good, it is well worth the cost of subscription!  In addition to all
this good linux stuff (it has already allowed me to save 34MB of hard
disk space I was using) there is about a 250 MB section of NeXT stuff.
I'll probably be to lazy to take this CD to work to try it on a NeXT 
machine, but I found a good portion of this stuff is handy to have
with Linux.  Just to mention a few things I've found under the NeXT
section:

          Lots of Cooking Repies  (That saved me the price of a cookbook.)
          "Green Eggs and Ham", and a couple of other Dr Suez stories
          Some *.el files for emacs that I didn't have yet.

So anyways, if you were waiting for some recommendations before
ordering, here is one.  This offer seemed so great to me, that
I went out and paid $200 for a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive just so I
could subscribe.  (OK, I was already planning on eventually buying
a CD-ROM drive, I just didn't plan to get one quite so soon.)

Subject: Unix Workstation Decision
Date: 18 Apr 1993 07:43:27 -0400


First of all:  Thank you everyone who replied.  As you can well
imagine, I got nearly one hundred responses, so I figured I'd thank
you all here instead of individually.

The tallies:

I got one vote for A/UX, which runs on the Macintosh.

I got several nays for Commodore's 3000UX system.

Most people agreed that SGI's were nice, and very very expensive.

Some (devoted) Sun users nearly insisted that I try to find a used
Sun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.

About a dozen people told me how they love their NeXT...only now NeXT
is out of the hardware business (see below).

And most of the other 85+ people said:  Get a 486 box, and run some
version of Unix that's available either in the Public Domain or
commercially.

=============

And so I weighed my options.  What stood out, in my opinion, was that
there were several different versions of Unix available on one system:
the 486 (PC) architecture.  If I bought a Sun, I'd have to use SunOS.
If I bought a (used) NeXT, I'd have to use NeXTSTEP (see below).  Ad
nauseum.

But with a PC, I can run Linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)
flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although I
hear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, another
PD (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  I can purchase
BSD386 (commercial product) if I choose.  There are several other
commercial packages available.

So, what I've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that I can
get a really good Unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  Including
source code!

Or, for ~$3500-4000, I can get an unbelievable EISA bus 486-66DX2
system, fully blown, and run single user BSD386.

What I'm really excited about, though, is NEXTSTEP for Intel.  NeXT
changed into a software company only, and they are releasing their OS
for PC's.  I've used NeXT's before, and I absolutely loved them.
Everyone who wrote me about NeXT (or NEXTSTEP) commented on the
developer's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.

===========

So, my choice is to:

1)  Wait for the mail on Monday, so I can read what NEXTSTEP's system
requirements are

2)  If I'm wowed on what they say, I'll buy a system that fits into
their criteria

    2a)  Get NEXTSTEP

3)  If I'm wowed, but I can't afford it yet (most likely), I'll buy a
system that fits their criteria

    3a)  Get Linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so I
can save up for NEXTSTEP

4)  If I'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), I'll buy a system
that is slightly less blown out (like a 486DX 25, ISA) and put Linux
or 386bsd on it.

================

Again, thanks to everyone around the net.

Soft-PC only emulates a 286, I believe (at least, that's what the Sun
version does), so no, it won't work.

I tried it with my tcsh (version 6.02, compiled with libc 4.1, now running
with libc 4.3.3) but I cannot reproduce the behavior: it just says `Word too

When the "file" gives something like:
 old sun-2 not stripped
What's it talking about?  Just a wrong guess?  I've noticed
it in what seem to be non-text log files - faillog in /usr/adm
and history.pag in the news stuff.  Is there any suggested
modification to the /etc/magic file?

Of course, for all I know, they *are* old sun-2 files.  If
that's the case, I guess follow up to c.u.q., or mail me
with instructions to read a book.

Subject: 'floppy: unexpected interrupt' on SLS .99p8
Date: 18 Apr 1993 15:39:25 +0100


I recently FTP'ed and tried to use the SLS version of Linux. I booted the A1
disk, and fed A2 later. Once booted, I tried to see the /user/README file. 
While my more waits for keys, I get messages saying 'floppy: unexpected 
interrupt' while the floppy drive doesn't (apparently) do anything. I thought
switching the turbo off might stop it, but on the contrary, things seem to
get worse. 

After a *lot* of attempts (the drive seems to lose sync when this appears 
while it is working, causing errors), I managed to get most of the Base 
Section to install on my hard disk. I created the second booting floppy, 
and the same familiar message appears again on my screen whan I boot Linux. 
It even appears at the prompt sometimes. Any ideas?

My system is a 486-33 w/105MB HD and a Trident 8900c card.

Thanks in advance, 
Kostas.

Subject: TERM & XWINDOWS REMOTELY
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 14:33:04 GMT


A while back, I posted a message about getting Xwindows working remotely
without a slip link.  Exams have interrupted my progress with this little
project, but I am still working on it.

The solution I was persuing was the suggestion of Gene Choi
(genie@netcom2.netcom.com).  Part of this procedure was to use the program
known as "term" to link the remote machine and the linux machine at home
together by running term on both.  It works very nicely on the remote
unix machine - though I get a warning message when I run it:

ld.so: warning: /ur/lib/libc.so.1.7 has older revision than expected 8

But it works.  In linux, on my PC at home - when I run term, it just seems
to 'hang'.  I can run it, but anything typed is just output to the shell
once I break out (usually by typing CTRL-Z and killing the job).  It could
be that there was some kind of error during compilation - compilation was
a royal pain on the linux machine.  In this case what I need is a binary
for sun4 unix and a linux binary that are the _same_ version of term
(which is what I think I've got now - version 1.07 or something).

Of course, in order to link with the "term" program running on the sun4
unix machine I have to run a terminal program (like minicom) in linux on
my PC.  The terminal program must be running when I execute term or my
modem hangs up. 

If anyone's got any suggestions/solution to the problem, they would be
greatly appreciated.

Subject: XWINDOWS PREFERENCES
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 14:44:19 GMT


Having just recently set up Xwindows in my linux environment, I'm curious
about how I cater Xwindows to my own needs.  TWC (I think it's called) is
what I've got in my .xinitrc file.  The menu has got some interesting
items, but some of them are really quite useless and I'd like to delete
out of the menu.  There are also items I'd like to insert into the menu. 
How do I change it?

When I initally start an application under Xwindows, the window outline
for that application is "stuck" to the mouse and I must chose somewhere to
put the window on the screen.  How do I get the window to just appear on
the screen as opposed to being stuck to my mouse?

The shells have really stupid fonts - worse than the fine print on a
newspaper.  I'd like to alter both the color background for the shell
windows, their default size and default font as well as change the default
prompt.  How can I do this?

I have to agree with you here.

Nate:
I can't see what your problem is in practice. Ok so you feel that public
software should be completely free from all restrictions, but
unfortunately this world is full of people who are happy to hoodwink
people and make a fast buck, by lying about who wrote the software and
not passing on that freedom.

People who write public software only do it for one thing: to see their
name in lights. That might seem frivolous, but I believe it's true. So
if that is their only motivation, then don't allow the sharks to take
that away from them. After all, no motivation, no software.

Us techie's know what we are doing, we know that we can get the latest
version of something from the net, other's are not connected, or are
not technical enough to realise that the software they have just bought
for mega bucks, is public software and that they have not been given
the source. The GPL protects the writer & the end user (often the
"little guys").

At the end of the day, I think that in practice, that there is no problem.
BSD386 is charge-free (except for a requested donation), GNU is
charge-free. I don't believe that BSD386 will ever be charged for, so
it will stay in the public software arena anyway, whether it is
forced to or not by the GPL.

Just a few ramblings

I had one other Problem with /bin/mail
If I mailed a mail to a user & ther was no /usr/spool/mail/user available
it creates one with the ownership of the SENDER. I used several permssion
settings. 
 /bin/mail is set root.mail and with -rwsr-sr-x
-> Mailfile was SENDER.mail

How can the above be fixed othere then creating for each user an emty Mailfile ?


BTW with smail you can get smail istall a /bin/mail (moving the old one to
/bin/lmail ) and uses just for reading mail the /bin/lmail and for sending
the /bin/mail, which interacts with /usr/lib/sendmail (linked to smail)

With some doubt, I tried to make TERM 1.07 running over a 2400 modem line
to connect to my department's Sun Sparc. TRSH works fine though slow. I
then tried TXCONN (I didn't believe it will run over 2400 line before).
Wow! The XMAN and AXE editor on my department's side came out slowly!

Thanks to those people who make TERM so nice! (though I might consider
getting a 9600 modem for faster speed). 
Got only one question: how to exit TERM? I use HANGUP so far.

If you REALLY want to ensure your code is distributed by others in the same
vein as when you distributed it, you HAVE to add restrictions to it demanding
that (funny, this is exactly what the GPL does...).

   The original BSD copyright has been this way, but unfortunately a group of
   people take the code, fix the code, and then place restrictions on it.

If you don't like this (the BSD copyright allows it on purpose as others
have commented), you probably like the GPL more than you think. The GPL
is the only license I've seen so far that ensures that a piece of
software stays free over its lifetime. Placing a piece of code in the
public domain or using a BSD-ish copyright ensures that anyone can
get the code as originally distributed, but nothing more.

I also don't understand why you think it's ok for a developer to
  take the BSD code, add their own fixes to it without making them available,
  and then sell the system binary only with the most restricting copyright
  notice you can imagine,
but don't like it when another developer
  takes the BSD code, add their own fixes to it and then makes them available
  under the GPL.

Hmmn...that's really weird. I was installing Linux last night on my laptop, and
got this message too. (That was with version 0.99p6 I believe). However, the
"floppy: unexpected interrupt" message only appeared when I was not connected 
to an AC adapter--so I presumed it was because the system was trying to 
conserver power by sending power down signals to the floppy drive or something 
or another. But since you were getting it on your desktop, I'm beginning to 
wonder why that is.

Hi,

don't know how this could happen, but I've got a corrupt filesystem now,
and neither fsck -a/-r can fix this. (Yes, I usually *do* a shutdown

The problem is: after correcting some things, fsck gives me:
        Warning: inode count too big
and it seems to run into an infinite loop, cause I get this messsage
over and over for about half an hour until it stops with "memory exhausted"
BTW, it's a plain vanilla Minix/Linux FS.

I don't have *any* idea how this can be fixed.  Is there a kind soul who
can help me out of this mess?  Yes I tried RTFM, but no doc for fsck on
my SLS .98 system with .99pl6 kernel, and the doc for efsck didn't really
help me.

PLEASE, PLEASE, help me. I'm lost ...

Does anyone know anything about the Future Domain 1670 card?  I'm looking for a
SCSI card to buy, and I've found a generally reputable mail order company (i.e.
not one of the cheapest) which is selling one of these for 109 pounds.  Now, I
have a friend who has a Future Domain 1660 card, which I know is Linux
compatible, but he paid 169 pounds for it, before the pound devaluated.  This
suggests to me that the 1670 isn't as good, but I know nothing about it other
than its code number.

So, does anyone know: is it 16 bit, is it Linux compatible, and what's the
difference between it and a 1660?

need help with INGRES


I have download INGRES04 package, compile it, and install it as much as I
can understand. But  now, after I am typing the command 'ingres databasename'

I am getting 3 lines of prompt, and then a new command line with '*' as a
prompt. at this point the ingres accept evrything Iwrite and do nothing.
I can type anything into this prompt, press Enter, and just get another '*'.

what have I done wrong?

first off, thanks to all who have sent me info on low-priced UPSs.  I'd
certainly never seen a UPS for $99 (US), but now know that they do exist
(remember, all I need is 3 seconds here...that's twice as long as the
longest outage I've seen here).  in fact, I never knew that there were
UPSs that were that small...of course, the only UPSs I ever really saw
were intended for large equipment (networking equipment in this case)
that had to stay up, period....

the $99 is still out of my current budget, but the day my budget will
support it.....

I am.  UUCP processing runs during the night to connect to a couple of
machines, and there are other things called under cron (e.g., calendar,
etc.).

anyways, thanks again everyone for the info on where to get UPSs cheap.

Ah yes, it is much more 'morally' correct to do the same thing, but call
it a 'much nobler' way to restrict code.  

My grief is caused from this complaint of 'stealing' code, and then the
same thing happening 'for the good of all men', when if fact it is the
SAME THING!!

I don't claim to be perfect, but I don't claim to be doing 'great and
wonderful things' to the world by taking someone's code and then
slapping a more restrictive copyright on it.

That's the bottom line.

What you choose to do with my code is your business.  But don't tell
me you are doing the world a favor by restricting my work.

The Amiga computer also uses a write-back cache for parts of it's file
system.  It automatically syncs after 3 or 4 seconds with no disk
activity.

I think any personal unices should do the same thing.  It further bugs
me that sync'ing my Interactive Unix system isn't enough to avoid the
need for an fsck; I *must* dismount the drives when I shutdown.

DEC never claimed to be 'morally superior', and convince the world that the

Subject: ld & X11 errors (Yes, I'm using -lX11)
Reply-To: keh5@midway.uchicago.edu
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 18:11:48 GMT


First off, my (1)THANKS to the people who responed to my
        rw_swap_page: bad swap file
post.  (2)APOLOGIES:  you were right, it was in the FAQ.

At least I've learned my lesson, I have searched the GCC and
March FAQ and I can't seem to solve this problem:

I'm trying to compile some of my own code for X11.  Everything
compiles alright, no errors at all; but I keep getting linker 
errors:
>/u/.../x11_vpm.c:64 (/u/.../vpmgr.o): \
        Undefined symbol _ServorVendor referenced from text segment
>/u/.../x11_vpm.c:73 (/u/.../vpmgr.o): \
        Undefined symbol _Xflush referenced from text segment
>/u/.../x11_vpm.c:74 (/u/.../vpmgr.o): \
        Undefined symbol _XDrawstring referenced from text segment
        
Now before you stop reading, yes I am using -lX11, in fact I've
used numerous combinations of
        LDFLAGS=[-dynamic|-static] [-nojump] -lX11 -lXmu ... 
with all the Xlibs I could find in /usr/lib; along with compiler
-g/-O options on and off.  Still no dice.

My first thought was that that it wasn't looking in the right spot
for the libs (even though all the Xlibs were with libc, libm...):  
so I did 
        mv /usr/lib/libX11.a /usr/lib/libX11.a.keh.
This time I got a "ld: <couldn't find/open libX11.a>" (paraphrased).
So it would seem that ld is finding all the -lX* libs and is opening 
them; still though the dependencies are not resolved.

And I guess thats about the best description I can give of the problem
aside from:

have read from Xbooks this _should_ be what works):

Any help would be greatly appreciated; please respond by email.

PS      Perhaps if someone is feeling _really_ generous, they could
explain the difference between /usr/lib/*.a and /usr/lib/*.sa (static
or shared?); and why is there a /usr/lib/libm.ca instead of
/usr/lib/libm.sa?

GOD I HOPE THIS ISN'T LURKING IN THE FAQ SOMEWERE :-)

You do not care, as long as the car drives?

You support them with your money, guy, and you are full responsible for it.

Would you buy a mercedes? 
Would you buy tropical-woods?

on to unzip -- but when I compile, it gives me a bunch of "linux/xxxx.h: No

found only four .h files in it.

What's supposed to go in there?  Iknow this is a FAQ, but I checked the

I am having trouble with device lockage.  While fooling around with term

This makes it impossible for any application to access my modem port.  For
those of you who mentioned it in your responses to previous queries I've

helpful information in them.

Question: How do I 'unlock' a device - in particular /dev/modem?

I have never heard of it hanging in this manner, but there were a few
failings in older versions of e2fsck.  Version 0.2e is much more
robust, especially at fixing bad directory entries.

Exactly correct.  "sync" does *NOT* guarantee a valid filesystem.  If
applications are writing to the filesystem during the sync, then it is
quite possible for the filesystem to be inconsistent after the sync -
this is true of any filesystem, not just ext2fs.  Sync only guarantees
that all data which was dirty when the sync began will be written to
disk.

This is why you don't get the valid flag set unless you unmount the
filesystem.

As I say, version 0.2e may well have cured your problems already.  If
you still get this problem with e2fsck-0.2e, then don't just despair
at it - give Remy Card or myself a bug report, and we will do our very
best to isolate and fix the problem.

I can assure you that this is a mistaken impression.  We are trying to
produce a solid, reliable and fast filesystem.  Ext2fs was designed
from the beginning to be easily expandable, but the future extras take
second priority to the reliability of the existing system.

As it happens, I ended up spending much less time last week developing
new ext2fs code than I had hoped, because of a couple of bug reports
which took priority.  The fixes (one in ext2fs, and one in the
high-level Linux filesystem code), and the latest (0.2e) filesystem
itself, will be in the next kernel release and are in the current
Linux alpha testing release.

Remember, though - we cannot cure any bugs which don't get reported.

Cheers,
 Stephen Tweedie.

Subject: How to get correct timezone offset?
Date: Thu, 15 Apr 1993 17:53:53 GMT

In Linux in the is no 'altzone' external variable, and no tm_tzadj
element in 'struct tm' structure. So, I see no regular way to find
current difference between local time and GMT. I don't count the idea
of computing difference between outputs of gmtime() and localtime()
calls... 

So, the question is: how to find the current timezone offset (with
respect to possible daylight savings) from a C program?

Thanks in advance,

The primary difference between the 1660/80 and a 1650/70 is that the 1660/80
has support for 2(3?) floppy drives.  The external SCSI port of the 50/70
is a DB-25 connector (FDC Model HCA-120 or Apple compatible cable) while the 60/80
has a HD-50 connector (FDC Model HCA-112).
In addition, the 50/70 supports FAST (10 Mb/sec) transfers on the internal
(50pin) SCSI connector.

Is it LINUX compatible?

The answer is yes as there is a driver for it.
I just got a 50/70 (ROM BIOS v3) card this weekend and have been playing
around with it (and a 120 Mb Connor SCSI drive). 
The problem is that I have *not* managed to get it to work properly.
The included DOS test software has no problems accessing the drive.

The FAQ wrt Future Domain driver states that the used interrupt must
be carefully checked.  Is is checked!  Still no go.

I suspect that there might be an autoprobe problem.
The Linux Future Domain driver recognizes the card properly but
when debugging is compiled in it turns out that the first command
(a SCSI querry if the drive is ready) never is followed by any 
interrupt.  OK, so there is a problem with the interrupts!
I think not, as booting linux (0.99pl7A no auto config serial)
*WHITHOUT* any SCSI drivers, puts the Future Domain card in a locked state.
(The same thing happen with the SLS a1.test disk.)
E.g. the DOS test software can not speak to the card after a C-A-D.
A hard reset or power of must be done to get the card to talk.

Thus, I suspect the something (a probe) prior to the SCSI driver puts the
Future Domain card into the dead looked state.

This problem may be specific to my hardware (vanilla 486@33).
Is there anyone that is using a Future Domain 16x0 with 0.99pl6 or later?

The way to do this is to use the bootp protocol with the tftp protocol,
both of which can be implemented in a boot rom. I'm in the process of
looking at this. 

The boot boot roms you write of (correct me if I'm wrong) at the moment would
normally be for Novell type boots. Presumably this would use IPX. These would
have to be replaced by ROMS suitable for TCP/IP.

BOOTP and TFTP are defined in RFCs 906, 951, 1048, with more info in rfc1123.

For more info you can join th enet digest. My posting is reproduced here:

=======================================================================

I am working on a DOS version of BOOTP + TFTP. The aim is:

- to allow a diskless 386 box to remote boot Linux

- to allow Linux to be booted from DOS, (e.g. from a machine with a
floppy)

The types of applications that this would be useful for include X terminals,
diskless workstations, and embedded applications.

The goal is to make the code work with only bios calls so it can
be made into a boot rom.

I realise that boot roms do exist, but I want to make a free one, with
source, that anyone can burn, give away sell etc.

I have gotten some distance. I have taken the NCSA telnet software
and stripped away most of what is not needed. I have the bootp 'working',
and have added the tftp and am getting it working.

The reason I am using the NCSA stuff is that it has it's own Ether drivers,
and I want a) the program simple to use (not have to load packet drivers)
and b) the porting of the packet drivers to a boot rom is more work (stripping
out DOSisms) and c) I want the boot roms to be able to be sold / given away
etc without having to worry about the GPL license (N.B. I am not going to
discuss the merits or other of GPL)

What do other people think?

One of the major issues I have come across as far as the kernel is
concerned is the ramdisk (This will be needed for any diskless system)
Currently this is anywhere in memory, and the kernel tries to load
it with data from the boot device (e.g. floppy).

I'm trying to think of a general way that preloaded images (which
is what must happen with a network boot) can be seen at startup
by the kernel. This would be of general use, for example, where
bits of the system might be in eprom, or there might be holes in
the adress space.

Anotehr issue is the format of the boot image. Does anyone know of
a 'standard' format used by the proms for pc-nfs etc? By this I mean
magic numbers, location 'fixers', size words etc.

Does anyone know of any legal impediment to using the NCSA stuff? 

Can anyone point me in the following directions?

Has BOOTPD (N.B. bootp_d_) been ported to Linux? Is so or no where do I
go?

Some mention was made of the 'ris' package. Not having ftp I can't easily
scan and find. Where is this?

Am I insane and has this all been done before?

Regards,
Jamie Honan

   Hi, there. I'm so impressed with Linux that I'm going to be weaning myself
off my trusty Amiga and using the Linux box as my Main Machine. If I do this,
I need to know what tools are available for the things I do.

   I notice that there is very little mention of applications here (I tried
the X-Windows group - they don't talk about apps much eather, and when they
do, I'm never sure if the app would run under Linux) BTW, in considering
splitting this group, I'd like to reccommend an .apps sub-group.

   Anyway, counld someone give me some reccomendations for the following
apps:
     - (Word Processing is taken care of. I like micro-Emacs and groff, and
if I outgrow them, there's TeX.)
     - Spreadsheets
     - Database manager (I can use text files and the rich array of text
utilities available such as awk, grep, and sort, but if there's a nice,
simple DBMS out there...)

Now for the tough stuff (I'm assuming I'll have X running):
     - GIF/JPEG viewer: I've seen several. Which is the best?
     - Graphics converter: JPEG <-> EPS, etc. especially with scale, crop,
etc.
     - Paint program: or at least some method of bitmap editing.
     - FAX send//receive
     - CAD

Hardware/software combos:
     - Video capture: grey-scale is fine.
     - EPROM programmer: (OK, I'm dreaming!)

Although I'd prefer public domain stuff, If someone can recommend a
commercial app that's not too expensive and runs on Linux, that would be OK.

You can post responses or E-mail - I'll post a summary if there's enough
response.

THANKS!

This is good advice--just one problem...it's   W R O N G.

Coherent version 4.x and (potentially) higher require a 386, minimum.
For a 286 you could use 3.2.1 or earlier.

Except for that little problem, though, it's good advice.

Also, you might be able to find an old copy of Xenix/286 floating

Does that belong to somewhere else :-)? Under some Unixes including
Linux, you can limit the consumption of system resources, from CPU,
memory to file, by the current process and each process it creates
can be obtained with the getrlimit call and set with the setrlimit call.
A resource limit is specified as a soft limit and a hard limit.  When a
soft limit is exceeded, a process may receive a signal (for example, if
the cpu time is exceeded), but it will be allowed to continue execution
until it reaches the hard limit (or modifies its resource limit).
Only the superuser may raise the hard limits. Other users may alter
soft limits within he range from 0 to hard limit or (irreversibly) lower
hard limit.

Please do man getrlimit on a bsd system.

Well, the Windows driver could set some registers on your card; when you
soft-boot, these don't get erased. Then you run Linux, and those registers
are how they should be to get into X. When you hard-boot, the power gets cut,
and the registers are restored to defaults, which are not good for X.

One way to figure out what is being done is to write a program to dump
your card's registers; then run it before & after you run windows, and see
what's different. Then, write a program to set the registers, and run that
before you run X.

Subject: linux partitioning help
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 20:33:10 GMT

What's the best way to partition my hard drive for Linux? I have SLS and I
have 2 IDE drives. The first is 120 mb and the second is 100 mb. I have 20mb
set of for DOS right now. How large should the swap partition be? How about
the root partition? Should I have either of these?

thanks,

I've been using a Future Domain 1680 on a 386/40 machine since about 
0.98pl5 (current version 0.99pl7A). No problems to speak of.
The card uses IRQ5; it was set up like that when I got it.

You haven't read the tutorial :-) You have to type \g at the prompt to get

Oh, Jesus, here we go again.

Look, folks, regardless of the merits of a side-by-side comparison of
operating systems (I personally think they are a Good Thing), it has
been PROVEN time and again that it is IMPOSSIBLE to do this
impartially over USENET.  Some little fact is wrong or presented in
such a way that some acolyte of one OS faith becomes mortally

About this time, I think there needs to be two new newsgroups:

Yeh - this is a good point. I'm thinking of getting a linux system,

At the Uni here they have International Framemaker (very good
WYSIWYG). I wonder if they'd port it to linux and give it away :-) (No

xv (by bradley@cis.upenn.edu) cannot only be used to display GIF/JPEG,
etc., but also to convert to and from: PM, PBM, X11 bitmap, Sun
rasterfile, postscript and TIFF. It does scaling, crops, etc. and
dithers colour images for you if you want for black and white usage.

xfig is quiet good, line editing program.

I've been thinging about this, as I'll probably get a modem capable of
sending fax. Would it be possible to set up a printer queue that sent
what you put into it down through the fax?

Ideally you could set up a queue that took PS, used ghostscript to
build a bitmap of whatever type the fax sends then blast it down your
serial port.

Any ideas on how to recieve though? How do you know if it's a remote
login or a fax comming in?

There's some quiet good VLSI CAD stuff about (magic is one I've used)

guess.

You can get EPROM programmers that are controlled by anything with

The programs I mention are all PD, use your local archie site (guess
this is archie.mcgill.ca for you) to locate the sources, ftp them and
compile them up on your system.  Alternatively maybe someone could
point us to linux binaries (I know there's been talk about trouble
getting xv to work on linux).

I have compiled Magic up on a Sun IPX (only used 45 meg of disc
space!)

Hope this gives you a few ideas anyway,

Subject: need SCSI advice, FD 1670 vs UltraStor 14f
Date: 18 Apr 1993 22:46:38 GMT

Hello I hope someone can help me.  I need to buy a SCSI controller for my new
CDROM drive, and I want to get a good one that will be compatible with future
SCSI devices that I may buy in the future.  I can't really afford the
Adaptec 1542 (about $250 bucks), and I've basically nailed my choices down
to two adapters:

Future Domain TMC-1670  $129    (don't need a floppy controller)
Ultrastor 14f           $199

I need the adapter to work with OS/2 2.x and Linux (and hopefully other cool
operating systems- I don't give a crap if it works under DOS or not).

My question is, is it worth it to pay $70 bucks more for the Ultrastor 14f?
Is the Future Domain adapter a good SCSI adapter and is it compatible with
most SCSI devices?  I have heard very good things about the Ultrastor 14f
and I'm leaning toward buying it but I would like to have that extra $70 bucks.

Please email or post with responses, I will post a summary of email advice if
it seems like it will help others in a similar quandry.

Thanks a billion and may your flocks of sheep and goats multiply bountifully.

[ Guess you are not using a Conner hard drive ... ]

So, I guess it all comes down to the SCSI harddisk in use.
I did a scan through some old messages in comp.os.linux and did indeed find
a message describing problems with Future Domain controllers in conjunction
with Conner SCSI drives (it is a cheap Taiwan thingy).
(it hasn't even got a LED indicating disk activity ...)

If you use a Future Domain SCSI controller could you please send a note
describing the type of the hard drive you are using and the version of
the FDomain controller (50/60/70/80) and it's ROM BIOS version.
If I get more than 0 responces I'll summarize to this group.

I'm using linux on a Bernoulli 'PC Powered Pro 90' right now.

But it won't work with IOMEGA's controller, unless someone writes a
driver for it.  I bought an adaptec 1542 and it works great with it.
The best part is that IOMEGA *just* came out with new 'OAD' drivers
for DOS that support the 1542.  So I still keep all the DOS features
such as 30-minute spindown and removable media support.  (You can get
the driver update free by calling IOMEGA's bbs (801/778-4400).

Subject: Re: CD-ROM NeWS

For those of you holding off ordering from jana@canrem.com, I just
got the first issue and it is great!  Basically, it looks like the
ftp directories from a mirror site!  However, since this only contains
150MB or so of linux stuff, so some of the neat stuff is missing.  
However, that is why there are 5 more issues in a years subscription.
For the price it is great, if just 2 issues out of the 6 this year are this
good, it is well worth the cost of subscription!  In addition to all
this good linux stuff (it has already allowed me to save 34MB of hard
disk space I was using) there is about a 250 MB section of NeXT stuff.
I'll probably be to lazy to take this CD to work to try it on a NeXT 
machine, but I found a good portion of this stuff is handy to have
with Linux.  Just to mention a few things I've found under the NeXT
section:

          Lots of Cooking Recipes  (That saved me the price of a cookbook.)
          "Green Eggs and Ham", and a couple of other Dr Suez stories
          Some *.el files for emacs that I didn't have yet.

So anyways, if you were waiting for some recommendations before
ordering, here is one.  This offer seemed so great to me, that
I went out and paid $200 for a Mitsumi CD-ROM drive just so I
could subscribe.  (OK, I was already planning on eventually buying
a CD-ROM drive, I just didn't plan to get one quite so soon.)

Hy folks,

a few weeks ago I've upgraded from 99p2 to 99p6 by getting a new SLS. Short
times I realized I've to upgrade my libc to 4.3.2, because of uuxqt probs
and other (I think) open() related stuff. Today I took my system to my 
company and saw that inet is broken. Relinking to libc.4.3 inet works again.
But using libc4.3 uuxqt breaks :-(((

So does libc4.3.3 solve both problems ?

Date: 18 Apr 93 21:58:47 GMT

I am trying to configure the imake stuff, I found the directory /usr/X386/lib/X11/config/* files.  Which ones sould I modify?  whick ones should I leave alone?

The stuff seems to be wrong for my system, I know I should change some of it,
but don't know enough of what not to chnage.

I have SLS 1.0, gcc 2.3.3, libc.so.4.3, Xfree1.2


                                                thanks,
                                                        jwomack

        Nonetheless, I do not see any reason why people could not add a sbin
directory.  All we really want is perhaps two or three binaries that would be
required to fix a screwed symlink, not the complete set.  Those of us that hack
the shared libraries always keep a staticly linked ln lying around, and it is
beginning to appear that regular users might also like this safety net.  I
suggest that someone who really cares create a set of staticly linked binaries
from the fileutils package, and create an sbin distribution so that anyone who
wants can throw this on their hard disk.

        The problem is probably with the Texel.  There is a known firmware bug
in x024 which results in scsi bus lockups.  You must have firmware on the texel
with a version later than 1.05 - if you have 1.05 or earlier you will probably
have difficulties.  I understand that for 19.95$ you can get a firmware upgrade
from Texel (the bug was fixed in 1.06, but the current version is 1.09).  Your
warranty does not cover the upgrade, so you always have to fork over the dough.
I can provide more info that I have clipped from the alt.cd-rom newsgroup for
anyone that wants it.

If the process that had the lock is now dead, shouldn't the new process

Subject: Soundblaster driver installed..
Date: 19 Apr 93 01:22:12 GMT


I'm impressed!  I just installed "snd-driv.1.0" and it works great.  It
has a little program called "str" that will play "mod" files.  It works
better (quality wise) then anything I have used on the MSDOS side.  It
multitaasks just fine too..  It's just kooooool..

Anyway I have noticed that certain "mod" files (Soundtracker and 
Noisetracker files) can't be played with the "str" (or it's friends "str15"
and "str32").  Does anyone know if this is a problem with the "str" command
or some bogus "mod" format (note, they play fine with trakblaster on the
msdos side)..

Later,
Pierce

        It was linked with older versions of the libraries. I think that there's
        a 4.3.1, 4.3.2, & 4.3.3; I don't know which the newest SLS has.

Textsw is part of Open Look. I assume you're trying to use cmdtool as your
seyon-emu; try xterm. (ln -s /usr/X386/bin/xterm wherever-seyon-emu-is)

I don't know where the .text_extras_menu file is; it isn't included. However,
this should only be a warning, not a fatal error.

Very nice of you to show us how ignorant you are.

Why, have I hack my brains out for the last year on 386bsd?

To allow thousands to enjoy in the comfort of their home a
workstation. Not to mention the numerous ports of available
PD software.

Why dont you mention that commercial enterprises not only seek
glory but also your money.


386bsd+Linux population as this point is a drop in the bucket
compared to DOS or the traditional "workstation".

Hi

I am trying to install Seyon.
After a makefile was made, I typed "make"
(according to the Instalation guide) but I get
messages saying  can't find some .h files.
I looked into the directory and I DID find the .h files.
Hoever in them, was $include <linux/name.h> command
and there is no such files in my /usr/include/linux directory.

I did install all the c1-c3 disks. What's wrong ?
I tried commenting out the commands that #include these
with no luck.
Is there some lib file I am missing ?

Also, I downloaded a xphoon program. I tried to run it from X
but it needs /lib/libX11.so.2.1.
I only have the .so.4.0 versions.
What do I do to be able to run xphoon ?

Thanks

Joel RAtsaby

erm, yeah,...
ok, I've discussed this type of thing before with people in private but this
is what has been done so far.

The idea of having bootp is to allow for diskless workstations,... such 
stations load all their programs remotely off a network and are usually
run as X11 terminals. The average cost of an X11 terminal is roughly in the
range of 3000 pounds (1 pound = $1.64). 

As linux can support X11 at next to nothing in the software costs department,
it would be nice to be able to takea cheap 386sx25 with only a monitor,
graphics card, floppy disk drive, fd controller, and network card and
be able to use it for an xterminal.

Now,... how many people want to hear that in the lab next door we have a
diskless linux machine which boots off the network and runs X11 from our
sun4. cos it does!

Now while I helped provide software and utilities, the main nuts and bolts
where written by Terry Barnaby form BEAM Ltd in Yate (UK)

Terry normally sells InterActive (solaris) PC systems for transputer
work but after I showed him linux 2 months ago he's come up with this
xterminal system to run on architecture independant servers ie sun3/4 hp aix
etc...

Now those desperate to get a hold of Terry can reach him on 0454 324512 (voice)
or 0454 315126 (fax) in the UK (international code +44)

Overview of the system internals (technical):

        The xterminal system relies on unused bytes in the CMOS RAM which
is initially setup using a boot floppy (will be moved to the prom in future
versions). These bytes are used to tell the kernel the network and router (if
any) and the local ip address to use to connect to the server ip where a daemon
service is attached to. The prom (currently on floppy disk at the moment)
uses udp to transfer the full blown kernel back to the machine which then uses
another FS (XTNET XTerminal NETwork) to pull all binaries across 

                          .--- send ------ rec  ---.
                         /                          \
<linux> - <UDPserver> - <                            >---- <XTserver> - <host>
                         \                          /
                          `--- rec  ------ send ---'

          <--------------------   XTNET service -------------------->

putting the UDP code onto prom is trivial, the reason it's on floppy at the 
moment is due to the lack of a prom programmer.

The main technical difficulty has been getting the UDP boot prom into 16k

Come to think of it that is the way windows does it.  It shouldn't be

Neither does the FSF.

What the FSF does say, however, is that you must continue to follow the GPL
if you distribute a program that include GPL'd code.  Part of this requirement
is that you must distribute source code to the entire product (with various
exceptions mentioned in the GPL and LGPL).

Various DOS-based compilers have their own restrictions -- and microsoft
used to claim that code output by their compiler *was* their code (or,
rather, a derivative product of your code and their code).  Most vendors have
changed their rather ridiculous licenses by now, but not all, by any
means.

I can dialout using kermit, and life is good. Dialins however do NOT

getty does a LOOP_BACK through the modem. the RD and SD lights BOTH

As expected the thing chews hard, and thats about all it does.

Does ANYONE have a clue?

I tried playing with stty crtscts < dev/ttyS0, but NO help there...
maybee I'm not doing it right. (example please)

If anyone has to knowhow to help me, please email me. My machine is on

Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 16:49:46 GMT
Reply-To: micha@moko.saar.de

I have some little problems / questions concerning ext2fs(d):

Using pl7A, ext2fs(d) with e2fsck -r for non root partitions in
/etc/rc, I had no problems.

But after an e2fsck pass was made (in case of non valid file system), the
message 'mounting an non valid filesystem' appears while mounting (after
e2fsck -r!).

OK, I ignored this.

But now, I tested (one time only!) pl8, and I watched that e2fsck does
some work - but linux had a clean shutdown before.

I switches back to pl7A - and it seems that the valid flag is never more
set no.

Even if I self umount the partition and start e2fsck -r, the file system
check is performed, but the fs was certainly clean and unmounted.

Are there any changes in pl8, which are the reason for this? How can I get
may valid flag back to life?

And another question: If I use 'mount root r/o first' in pl8, how may I
                      set the mount to non-r/o later (I user mount 0.99.6
                      at this moment).

I'll now delete my e2fsck-calls from /etc/rc, and I hope, there is a
solution to reactivate my validflags :-(

The "roll call" has to be smarter than this to work.  Otherwise we need
some other way to specify what is there and what is not (and where).

No program should ever do any function to any I/O port unless it already
knows for sure what is there, or knows that what it is doing cannot cause
any harm to any know device that could be there (highly unlikely).

Unfortunatly the PC design completely lacks any sort of roll call protocol
and apaprently lacks any device identication protocol as well (anyone
interested in designing a replacement platform?).

Frankly, I think the proper "unfortunate" fact is that 386 machines
are still out of the financial grasp of many people (most notably
students, who also generally seem to be the most enthused about PC
Unices).  I don't find it unfortunate that Linux doesn't run on a 286
any more than I find it unfortunate that it doesn't run on a 4004.

If anyone is honestly interested in a side-by-side comparison, we here
in the CS department at Indiana are going to be doing one this summer.
We're looking at building a new workstation cluster out of 486's, and
will be using four machines -- two Linux, two 386BSD -- for the first
half of the summer to see what we can get running on each system and
how well each system meets our needs for a public access cluster.  While
most of you out there won't be using your machines for public access,
we'll probably learn a few things that will apply in the general case.

If you're interested in seeing the results when they come out in

Well, in the interests of getting Seyon to look OK when I connect

I see some warnings about passing incompatible pointer args, but
that's not the big problem.

A 386sx is a drop in the bucket these days.  Even a full fledged dx cpu is a
commodity.  If you're willing to spend the time to look in a magazine like
Computer Shopper and maybe assemble systems yourself, a PC can be very cheap.
386DX-33 motherboard w/CPU    ~$210
4 megs ram                    ~$135
Case and power supply         ~$80
Floppy drive                  ~$40
VGA card                      ~$70

100 meg hard drive            ~$225
Multi I/O card                ~$15

Total:                         $965

You can also salvage many of these parts (vga card, floppy drive, case).  
Granted, this is a minimum system, but it is very usuable.  I've seen postings
about people running 386bsd on a 20MHz 386sx (price: ~$150).

You won't find me flaming such people.

The comp.os.linux group is getting very big, and though regular readers
will not realize this JUST BECAUSE they are regular readers, as newbie
will have a very difficult time finding the FAQ.  I've been away a while
and I ran into the following problems just finding the FAQ:

1.  There were over 13000 articles in this newsgroup to sift through.
    The newbie may or may not be fully versant in the tools of reading
    news to speed this up.

2.  I tried a regexp (key "=" in nn) to find the FAQ.  It selected a lot
    of articles, which I proceeded to read (key "Z" in nn so I stay here
    when done).  I read through all those articles.  Some referred to the
    FAQ, but there was no FAQ.

3.  The newsgroup news.answers is supposed to be the universal resource.
    I searched for comp.os.linux there.  Nothing.

4.  There is PIT-MANAGER.MIT.EDU, an FTP repository of all kinds of usenet
    stuff.  I did find the FAQ here, but with duplication that I questioned
    and funny names.  The duplicates are really duplicates (i.e. a waste
    of space).

5.  After some further reading I finally bumped into the FAQ here.  The
    keywords I expected were absent.  I therefore recommend to whoever
    posts the FAQ (now or later) to please put the follwoing keywords
    in the SUBJECT of the FAQ postings: "faq" and "comp.os.linux" (the
    latter for readers of news.answers).

Maybe someday, I too, can enjoy the pleasures of flaming newbies for dumb
questions that are already answered.  But I will hold back until it becomes
easy to find the FAQ.

Because it makes a mess.  Compression that does not get to take advantage
of the same kind of data in sequence, even when scattered on random blocks,
is just not going to do as good.

Then there is the random access issue.  So what if a 1024 byte block has
been compressed to 512 bytes (or 400 bytes or 600 bytes).  You have to
make use of the bytes that remain on the physical sector to gain anything.
The addressing becomes all distored and requires some complex logic to fix.

This form of compression gives distorted perspectives of what space you
have available and what space a file takes.  A C program that takes up
40000 bytes will be reported as 40000 bytes this way, whereas a GIF file
that takes up 40000 bytes will also be reported as 40000 bytes, even
though it actually needs more real space.

I would highly prefer seeing the size of files being reported by the actual
real space need, and be able to do very rapid direct access to random
positions in a file.  The solution is not simple, but I it does not seem
than the solution is an underlying compression system (I would put encryption
there, but not compression).  I believe the compression problem needs to be
addressed in terms of file formats, or at a point near that issue.  Perhaps
it should be in the standard library, but most certainly not in the kernel.

I had the same problem with a 114750 blk partition,

mke2fs finally succeded with 

mke2fs /dev/hda3 114700

and didn't care about loosing 50 blks.

This assumes all blocks can be compressed to 1/2 size.  I had hoped
such assumptions were readable only in the Nation Enquirer, but I guess

It's one thing compress a block of data.  It's yet another thing to take
advantage of that compression by writing something else in the rest of
the block.  And since you don't always get 512 bytes from 1024 bytes of
data, the remaining size available cannot be guaranteed to be 512 bytes.

Assume the hard disk has 1048576 blocks of 1024 bytes each.  How many
blocks do you make the file system for?

Is this chip going to make assumptions about what file system I am using?

How long will it take to get the FIRST BYTE of data from the file if the
size of the file is 100 megabytes (compressed)?

What if there is only 2 megabytes of free space?

That compress/decompress chip might do better to be a coprocessor to the
system which can apply the compression/decompression in the appropriate
context.

The inode is not the big issue.  How do you seek to byte #16777216?

If this is going to be the great universal file system, it is going to

Designing good standards would be as well.  With way too many problems
with underlying compression in file systems, I will have my doubts.
When the issues I have mentioned are addressed with solutions then of
course I might believe otherwise.

Same problem for very large files.  What if one of the big files gets
compressed, then later it is referenced when there is no longer space
to hold both copies?

*IF* it is sequential, making the decompression transparent would be
the way to go, and could be done in the library code, or the file system
interface (please, not the kernel).

For random files, something else is needed.

Another thing that is possible is for those who design their file formats
for new applications to integrate compression into it.

Subject: Linux Laptop - Advice?
Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 06:49:05 GMT

Hello!

In trying to narrow down my choices on a notebook/laptop computer to run Linux 
on, I thought I would poll the Linux group to see what types of systems are
being used and get some recommendations.   Things that I have been considering 
'important' are:

         - Is 8 meg of memory room enough for X or just adequate?  
           Many notebooks can only take 8 meg, and if that isn't going 
           to be enough, I will have to remove them from consideration.

         - Has anyone found a laptop with a built-in ethernet port that is 
           supported under Linux? (The IBM ThinkPad 300 is one that I was 
           told has an Ethernet port, but I don't know if Linux supports it.)

         - Does Linux work with built-in trackballs?  If the trackball isn't 
           useful, then there isn't much reason in having it in the way.

Thanks!
(If there is interest, I'll post a summary in 2-3 weeks...)

How about putting the compression layer between the applications and the
file system?

Random access of compressed data is difficult (seek to byte 16777216,
where do you end up in the compressed data?).  But whatever solutions
exist; they could certainly be applied at this layer.  But the SEQUENTIAL
file is going to work at this layer very well and will be able to take
advantage of more sophisticated algorithms.

One of my gripes about programs like Stacker is that I get lousy
compression in many cases; the algorithm has to find redundancy in
just a small amount of data.  I still have to PKZIP my files to get
the kind of compression I get now in DOS.

You picked nice round numbers.  Real life compression of real life data
involves whatever redundancy exists.  You could get 1024 compressed to
711 bytes.  Now where are you going to put it?  Are you going to reuse
the remaining 313 bytes somewhere?  Anywhere?

        I have had and seen so much news on the QIC-40/80,
        I have to recant it.

        BTW, QIC NEW vol.1 no.4 was lable wrong in the header.
        Look for a second version of vol.1 no.3.
        If you are confused e-mail me for a copy of NO.4.

        I thought you might appreciate some quick QIC stuff :-)
 
        Fiddling with QIC 40/80 drives and drivers has been a
        long and sporadic hobby of mine.  Like many others,
        what I really wanted and still want is a low cost, reliable
        SCSI tape drive.  Wistfully speaking, a QIC 40/80 type drive
        but with a SCSI interface and still in the price range of
        floppy-based QIC 40/80 drives, would be ideal.
 
        Originally I spent some time trying to convince several
        QIC 40/80 makers to come out with SCSI models of these drives.
        Only one vendor showed any interest.  In fact, only one vendor
        was even polite about it :-)   However, severe procrastination
        on the part of the vendor and decision on my part to get on
        with the rest of my life finally consigned the issue to oblivion.
 
        For a while I toyed with the idea of designing and building
        my own SCSI/FLOPPY embedded interface for QIC 40/80 drives.
        The idea being to add this little board to the drive and turn
        it into a SCSI tape drive.  I never did this, being too busy
        and otherwise convinced that somebody else would do it REAL
        SOON NOW :-)  I even managed to obtain tape drive driver source
        code from one of the tape drive vendors, no small feat.
        Unfortunately I am constrained by agreement from showing
        the code to another living soul.
 
        Serendipity seems to be seren-dipping at my door.  It seems
        that the aforementioned but unnamed QIC 40/80 tape drive
        vendor is finally going to come out with a SCSI version of
        its QIC 80 tape drive.  I am in the process of confirming
        this, so at the present it remains a vicious rumor :-)
 
        In the meantime Archive has come out with a couple of relative
        low cost QIC tape drives with SCSI interfaces.   An Archive
        QIC-6250 compatible cartridge tape drive with SCSI interface
        can be purchased from DC-Drives for $399.00 (bare drive)
        while the QIC-6525 compatible model sells for $569.00 for
        the bare drive.

        QIC80 / Jumbo lookalikes support
        ================================
 
        The Net Did It Again!
 
        I received a message from a CMS employee, telling me that he
        fought with management for a while and got them to release
        the necessary material to program a nice device driver for OS/2.
 
        Note: this is NO official CMS support, we have to do it ourselves,
        but at least we get the stuff needed for it.
 
        Aside from the fact that I personally think CMS should provide
        a driver themselves, instead of letting us hack it together,
        at least we can now start working on a nice project that will
        pay off for ourselves.
 
        As soon as I get the material, I will create a post out of it.
        For the moment, the main newsgroup for communications about the
        project will be comp.os.os2.programmer. A mailing list will
        be considered.
 
        As many people appeared to be eager to start on this one, some
        internal communication might save us from doubling efforts. On
        the other side, since the first available driver will probably
        become the de facto standard, we could organize a nice competition...
 
        As I presume OS/2, LINUX, and NT are all about the same when
        it comes to device drivers, I think some programmers could
        unite and produce a certain kind of compatibility between
        tape formats and maybe even re-use code. Are there existing
        Jumbo drivers for LINUX or NT? Please indicate your interest
        in this project and if you think you could assist in any way
        (e.g. "I have tried it for seven years but could not get around
        timing problems" etc.), please mail me or post it here using
        some QIC80 word in your subject line.

        I just got the file with the select/unselect commands.  It's quite
        simple.  All drives we sell through retail channels have a drive
        ID of 0, so the command would be 46, 2.
 
        This was actually proposed as a modification to the QIC spec at one
        time, so I don't know why the big deal is made of it.

        Proposed Change to QIC-117 Common Command Set Interface Specification
 
        The following two commands would be added to Table 2a:

        ----      ------------        -------------       ---------------

        46        Select Tape Drive      -----            - - - - - - - -
        47        Deselect Tape Drive    -----            - - - - - - - -
 
        Also, the Select Tape Drive command would be added to Table 2b:
 
        Code      Command Name        Argument(s)
        ----      ------------        -----------
         46       Select Tape Drive   Drive ID + 2
 
 
        Command timings are added to Table 2d:
 
        Code      Command Name        250 Kbps/XL 500Kbps/XL        Event
        ----      ------------        ----------- ----------        -----
         46       Select Tape Drive              0                  -----
         47       Deselect Tape Drive            0                  -----
 
 
        Command descriptions as follows:
 
        (46) Select Tape Drive.  Select the tape drive by activating
        appropriate interface signals.  If the tape drive is already
        selected then this command is treated as a NOP.  This command takes
        one argument in the N+2 form.  The argument is the tape drive ID.
 
        (47) Deselect Tape Drive.  Deselect the tape drive by de-activating
        appropriate interface signals.  If the tape drive is already
        deselected then this command is treated as a NOP.  A Soft Reset
        will also deselect the tape drive.

After installing xdm which _is_ using the shadow database instead of the passwd
database, I found a new bug or something like that. I am able to login as a 
normal user and everything works just fine. 

But everytime I'd like to logout (exit the twm, which was started with exec)
the *whole* system crashes!!! The keyboard seems to be disconnected and the 
screen looks damaged - nothing but pressing the RESET-Button helps me out! 

Did anybody find the same problem? How can I solve that? Any help appreciated!

Thanx

Subject: Emacs arrow keys under X - not working
Date: Sun, 18 Apr 1993 17:33:53 GMT

  I'm having problems getting arrow keys to work in an emacs window 
in X windows, although the arrow keys work just fine when I am in a 
plain text mode.  I am running XFree86 and Linux on an IBM PC clone.

I have the following relevant lines stuff in my .emacs file that enable
the arrow keys in the plain text mode.

(global-unset-key "\M-[")
(define-key global-map "\M-[A" 'previous-line)   ;; up-arrow (R8)
(define-key global-map "\M-[B" 'next-line)       ;; down-arrow (R14)

(define-key global-map "\M-[212z" 'end-of-line)       ;; R5
(define-key global-map "\M-[213z" 'other-window)      ;; R6
(define-key global-map "\M-[214z" 'backward-word)     ;; R7
(define-key global-map "\M-[216z" 'forward-word)      ;; R9
(define-key global-map "\M-[220z" 'find-file)         ;; R13
(define-key global-map "\M-[208z" 'beginning-of-buffer) ;; R1
(define-key global-map "\M-[209z" 'end-of-buffer)     ;; R2
(define-key global-map "\M-[218z" 'switch-to-buffer)  ;; R11

Any ideas what's going wrong?  Does anyone have a .emacs file that
works in both modes that is different?  Do you think the problem
is with my .emcas file, emacs, or some problem with my X setup?

Thanks for all your help.

I have recently swapped the Tseng 4000 card I have been using for windows 
and linux (X) out for an ATI Graphics Ultra hoping to gain greater speed
and a nicer looking screen (the low refresh rate of my old tseng on my
big montor makes for really annoying viewing).  The nicer refresh part
worked great and under windows the speed increase was noticable although
not huge.  

On the linux side of things I obtained the X8514 alpha server from tsx-11
and installation went smoothy and it looks quite nice.  The only problem
is it seems very slow.  This doesn't jive with my notion of the advantages
of an 8514.  I realize the server is a beta version and as such a lot
of 8514 fuctions may not have been implemented.  Does anyone have info on
the progress going on here?  I'd hate to have to switch back to my inferior
Tseng card just so I can display bitmaps acceptably quickly.  

One note:  the README with the 8514 alpha server says it was compiled 
for linux 98.? I think.  Would recompiling it with the newer libs give
any appreciable speed increase?  I weep to think of my snazzy card sitting
in my computer largely unused.

The xtoolplaces does seem to be a bit unstable, I also had problems with it.
My problems were related to the windows maintained by olvwm, the Virtual
Desktop and Workspace. If any of those were pinned on the root window,
xtoolplaces would hang when accessing the window properties. I wasn't sure if
the problem was with xtoolplaces or olvwm. Anyway, I kludged this in xtoolplaces
by scanning for window titles containing strings "Workspace" and "Virtual",
and ignoring those windows.

But your experiences suggest that there are other apps that can't be saved
either. I don't have Xsysinfo installed, so I can't check it. I can deliver
the source to xtoolplaces that I used to you if you want to debug it.

Subject: Kernel Panick: PCTOOL's COMPRESS applied to /dev/hda1 (dosfs)
Date: 19 Apr 93 08:24:49


I have

  386/40, 128K Cache, 8MB RAM, 128 MByte HD

On HD are two partitions:
  
  dosfs  on /dev/hda1 (20MB)
  ext2fs on /dev/hda2 (rest)

For booting I use LILO. The versions are SLS 0.99.? and LILO 0.7. 

Because 20MB DOS is more than I need, I wanted to use the just
announced FIPS-system to split the DOS-partition into to 10MB
partitions, from which I wanted to reuse the second one mainly for
/tmp and swappping. In FIPS-README it is suggested to use a common
disk-defragmentor (e.g. PCTOOLS COMPRESS) for preparing the DOS-HD for
splitting and then apply FIPS. 

PROBLEM:
After having applied COMPRESS to the DOS-partition I was not able to
boot LINUX from /dev/hda2 anymore. LILO comes up with the usual stuff
but is not able to mount the root-filesystem. The system hangs with a 
kernel panick (understandable!). 

Booting with a1 and a2 from SLS (filesystem in RAM) and applying
e2fsck on /dev/hda2 outputs "Magic Match failed". Hmmm, sounds bad! Is
it really????? Does anyone have the knowledge and the time to tell me,
whether there is a chance of rescueing the filesystem? Thanks a lot in
advance

Hello, all.

I have a problem with GCC.

After compiling printf( "Hello\n"); , everything seems to be OK:
the compiler and the linker both seem to get what they expect.

Anyway, when running a.out, I get the message:

Corrupt fixup table.

I think it has something to do with the libraries, but I can not find an
answer myself. All I found was some mentioning of the corrupt fixup table
in README.misc...

My setup is derived from hlu's basedisks, gccdisk and libdisks, all
copied into their original directories (I think ;-), libc.so.4.3.3 and stuff,
gcc 2.3.3, Linux 0.99.7 from hlu's rootdisk.

Could anybody help me out? I want to cc!!!!

Please reply through netmail, as this conference is fairly big for me to
maintain on a mere 2400 baud....

I agree wholeheartedly!  I'd even go so far as to ask developers to put in
a short description of the program and what its supposed to do.  Granted,
most man pages have this sort of thing, but often stuff doesn't come with
man pages.

If developers don't think this is a great idea, then at least submit
something to the LSM (Linux Software Map).  That way the info is at least
documented somewhere.

BTW: I'm still taking volunteers for helping with the LSM.  Mail me if
you're interested in lending a hand!  (jeffk@cyberspace.org)

Sure the book and Taylor UUCP differ in some aspects,

only use up to 70 Hz refresh rate in TrueColor, even with VRAM.
So I guess your refresh rate is to high for the ATI

Go archie for something called tracker

Hi, Bonnie. There is a complete Linux release available from some outfit
called Ygsdril Computing (or something like that). If you leave a
posting on the comp.os.linux newsgroup you should get a rise out of
someone there.

I run a CD-ROM myself. I rather regret it now as I really believe that
unless you have valid professional uses for them, then they're best
installed for your kids. I ran through the disks I bought at the time of
my drive purchase and I just haven't used them since then.

Is it handy to have a complete dictionary available that will also
provide accurate pronunciations of words? Yes. Does it drmatically
change my life? No. I like words and reading already. I think it would
be fantastic for children, though.
 
Something to think about.

After receiving some requests of people interested in my port,
I put it in the directory /linux/scheme-7.2 on the public ftp
area of artemide.dei.unipd.it .

Please consider it a 'tentative' release; there are other people
(Charles Fee, CXF111@PSUVM.PSU.EDU) who made ports of the
software to linux, I don't know whether better or worse than mine.
There are lots of options to deal with (management of sockets,
ptys, signals, (v)forks, etc.): I tried to make as much stuff as possible
run, but maybe I've forgotten something. I mean, the port was
something more complex than #define SYSVR3 and executing make.

I also submitted the patches to Guillermo J. Rozas 
(gjr@martigny.ai.mit.edu) at MIT, who will perhaps integrate
this contribution (and others') in the official MIT release.

Sorry, sorry, correct me if I'm wrong, but this has rather to do with the
fact that the linker assumes the presence of shared libraries by default.
But they do not exist for g++, so you have to link with the option "-static".
I had this problem too, someone gave me that hint and it worked.

I had the same problem with version 0.2d.  Well, actually e2fsck said
version 0.2c for filesystem 0.2d.  It would run out of memory (16 MB RAM)
while checking a 400 MB ext2 filesystem.

Anyway, the problem seems to be gone in version 0.2e.  At least on my machine.

I am not sure if this is a linux problem or a gcc problem.  I am using
gcc version 2.3.3 and libc (and libm) version 4.3.3.  I have a program
which I wrote that performs a lot of floating point math in a loop.
It does not use malloc therefore it should use a constant amount of
memory.  The program then writes this data to stdout (a total of about
2M of ascii).  On a sun 4 using cc the program uses 0.7% mem (by
comparison "ps -u" used 1.0% mem).  On my linux box with 8M and a 16M
swap disk I use up all of the memory (real and swap)!  The only other
program running is X (6M or so).  Also if I leave sysinfo running I
can see that the program steadily uses up more and more memory.  The
program is compiled with -m486 as the only option and -lm as the only
lib.

Since the problem does not exist on the Sun 4 I think that it is a
linux or gcc problem not a bug in my code (famous last words).

Note that the program runs it just uses about 17M to much.

Any ideas?

Rich

p.s. Is there a libhard that goes with the 4.3.3 libs? I could not
find one so I am using libm.so.4.3.3.  RDY

There was a discussion some weeks ago who could and would port Motif to Linux/X11.

I just want to ask if someone is using this type of monitor (Sony
CPD-1393). I have an italian Olivetti PC (PC PRO 486/33mt) with the
original Olivetti monitor, and when checking the manufactoring label it
shows that's an Sony CPD-1393. But I don't have any technical data about
it. I just know the available clockrates (checked with clock.exe) but
that's all. So has s/o the proper Xconfig entries for this monitor and
could email it to me ?
        thanx
                Christian

PS: This damn Olivetti-PC has a VGA+ card on board (Chips 'n' Tech CD 453
chip) with 640x480 and 1024x768 modes. Is the high resolution possible with
the Sony monitor ?

  You have obviously never met a North Sea `seagull' (of which there are many

  I wouldn't like to see a seagull as the Linux logo, simply because I 
associate them with bird droppings. (*Ug*). Sea birds are a real pest, they

I have the same problem! Trying 'ldd seyon' I mentioned that the libc.so.4

Is there a sound driver(that uses /dev/audio) for cardless speaker-only

I suppose, if maj14min4 doesn't work(I do this to show I've looked in the

Subject: How to open a SERIAL PORT for TERMINAL 
Date: 19 Apr 93 03:30:20 MDT


Hi, there,

I got a question when I set up my friend's Linux. If I want to enable a serial
port for a terminal or dial in device, how should I do. I check the FAQ in the
Linux, but I cannot figure out. My step as follows:

1). Modify the inittab in /etc
2). Setup a null modem cable from Linux to my 286 PC

Then I start both machine, but there is the message shown on Linux machine
continuously

Apr xx tt:tt:tt  init[1]: line 39 of /etc/inittab is incorrect

Thus I must put in my a1 and a2 and mount the Linux to /mnt, and modify the
inittab to previous manner.

Is there anyone ever successfully enable the port for the serial line. Any
suggesstion is appreciated. Thanks in advance!

I was wondering about other peoples' experiences installing the Texas A&M

install it on the harddrive? I know the  SLS  version takes about 70 Megs.
From the documentation, it would appear the TAMU installation procedure is
much easier, especially when it comes to configuring X. Can anyone back
this up??

Hallo Linuxers !

I succeeded in building the aXe (an X Editor) on my Linux-machine,
but there occurs the following errors when I try to load or save a file from
the menu:
1. Warning: Initializing Resource Lists twice
2. Warning: Initializing Translation manager twice

After displaying these warnings, aXe crashes and doesn't 
react to any keystrokes or mouse actions. I`m at my wits end because I
have no idea even what the warnings mean.
Everything else works while running aXe, e.g. file loading on the command
line is o.k.
Please contact me, if you have any idea concerning these warnings or if
you have built aXe successfully before.

Thanks and greetings to all Linux users !

        I don't think so. I (Everybody?) should be able to mount
        his/her dos partions, witch is supposed to be FAT-16. 
        Besides, DOS should not generate FAT-16 format  on 1.2MB
        floppies. I formatted a completely new disk with DOS-format,
        and it generatted FAT-12 format. I think it should be a

Since lots of people seem to be interested about playing these *.au files, you 
might want to know that I'm working on a driver to emulate /dev/audio using a 
digital/analog converter attached to one of the parallel ports.  Unfortunately,
only in my spare time can I work on it, and since I'm swamped with work and 
recently ran into a bit of a snag it might take a bit of time.  Still, 
preliminary tests proved encouraging, with acceptable sound quality.  However, 
if we only get marginally acceptable sound using 8 bits there's no way you 
would be able to understand, say, human speech, with plus or minus 5 bits you 
vcan get on the pc speaker, even if you could drive the thing at 8000 hz.  So I
see the pc speaker as a dead end in terms of sound hardware, unless you 
onlybeep it or something.

Surely it would be better to develop the secure kit & Linux kernel/fs/etc
side by side so there wouldn't be this problem of 'installing from scratch'
with a secure file system, etc.

Which is wrong, as you have apparently noticed already. But make sure
that no execute permissions (x bits) got lost in the process. (Shell
scripts need r bits for execution, too.)

The thing to look for is getty - see inittab about exactly which getty
you use, and make sure this getty exists and is executable (which
includes the path to it being executable by root; you always run into
strange situations with directories with no x bits at all...)

> Apparently, it is something at the very end of the boot/initialize

Yes, it is *after* the boot process, most probably. The boot process
looks like following:

- the kernel executes init
- init executes /etc/rc and waits for it to terminate
- init reads inittab (Sys V init)
- init spawns getty processes

You can leave out the touch - its work is already done by the line
above. (Btw, isn't it to be mode 644, or 640? I should check that
again...)

If you mention the things to mount in /etc/fstab, then you don't need
the explicit mounts, just mount -av will suffice. This is what mount
-av is for. (This is surely not your fatal error, but just a
consideration.) 

>  
> /bin/swapon /dev/swap

If you get the message from this, you are sure that /etc/rc is
executed properly - so init and rc do work. Look at what comes after
that, i.e. the reading of inittab (is it readable? Shouldn't matter as
init is root but for certainty...) and execution of whatever is in
there as getty. (I assume you're running Sys V init, but other inits
are similar. The programs that are executed from init should always
match the pattern /bin/*getty* or /etc/*getty*, however.)

Hope this helps.

Shelling out doesn't always suffice. A method that has proven to work
is: Use kermit (better than minicom for following reasons: (a)
non-bugged terminal control and (b) can be controlled with scripts) to
control your modem and log in, after running the host term type the
kermit escape character and then Z (or give kermit the 'suspend'
command), which will cause kermit to SIGTSTP itself.  Shelling out
(with !) from kermit will cause kermit to eat characters from the
line, making the term connection unusable.

I'm working on shell/kermit scripts to make the process of firing up local
and remote term servers automatic, but have run into the problem that
kermit's suspend does always suspend calling scripts too, when using
bash (is this an error in bash?), so I'm trying it with tcsh. First
results look better...

However, you are going to need to have the source code of the program and a
compiler to handle it. You probably also need a fair background in OS/2
application development, although stranger things have happened.

Me too, though it's a different Wangtek: the 5250ES.

I understand that the problem was fixed for Ultrastor users by
disabling the "cache" bit in the SCSI command mailbox.  However, I
can't find the word "cache" in the AHA1542 driver.  Can anyone tell us
(1) what this "cache" bit does, exactly; and (2) how I can disable it
on the AHA1542?

Hello everybody,
this week I want to buy a new PC with the intention to run Linux on it.
The german discounter ESCOM offers a 486DX2/66 with VESA local bus (2 slots).
I want to order it with a VLB IDE-controller and a VLB S3-VGA graphics-card
(both from ESCOM). 

Anybody there who has a similar configuration and who can tell me something
about compatibility and speed? What about the S3-card (I've heard that there
are drivers for it in XFree86, but what about this special card)?

Yes!  I installed TAMU Linux, and (a) it was remarkedly easy to 
configure, and (b) it had about as complete a Unix system as one could 
want.  I was able to get X running with a minimum of effort.

The current TAMU release is 0.99p4 is a few patch-levels behind.  
Personally rather than installing all the interim patches I am waiting 
until version 1.0 is ready and then will reinstall.

The only problem I had with TAMU Linux was that I couldn't get UUCP to 
work (segmentation fault -- core dump) but I read here from others that 
they *were* successful.

In summary, TAMU == Highly recommended.

Also as of libc4.2.2 (I think) /etc/inet/services and /etc/inet/protocols
have moved to /etc/ (or at least I think they have). I did this and
now my system works:

su
cd /etc
mv inet/* .
rmdir inet
ln -s . inet

Hope this helps.

I worked round this the messy way by creating symlinks from all
the files that make complained it couldn't make back to where
the files really were.

Subsequently I discovered something in the imake documentation
that told me to put something like "UseInstalledVersions" in my
site.def file. I'm not on my Linux box now so I can't tell you
for sure what the command was or where site.def is found (but
/usr/lib/X11/config/ springs to mind).

In other words do what I didn't and RTFM ;-)

Hi,Guys

I have a LILO problem with OS2's boot manager
that I need help with.
My syster is 486DX-33 with 16 Meg RAM,  

1st HD is 212Meg(130Meg-DOS[Primary],
70Meg-OS2[extended],1Meg-Boot Manager)

2nd HD is 130Meg(100Meg-Linux[extend] /dev/hdb5,
16Meg-Linux Swap /dev/hdb6, 8Meg-OS2 Swap)

I read the FAQ and LINUX User's guide.  I installed
the LINUX SLS on /dev/hdb5 sucessfully. I decided to
install LILO on the root directory, I changed the
/etc/lilo/config so that boot=/dev/hdb5, and I added
Linux using OS2's fdisk.

When I rebooted I chose Linux from OS2' boot manager,
I only see 'L' on the top of the screen, and hear 
HD moving, but nothing happends.
What is going on, and how do I rectify it?      
 
Thanks in advance

I had this problem too, when I updated from 99pl5 to 99pl6, and it did not
go away with any newer version. I suspect, that old /etc/getty,
/etc/init and/or /etc/login break with the new kernel versions.

I got the shadow.tpz from one of the SLS - a disks (I think it was A4),
installed it (using the old kernel), and everything became working again.

All of the BSD derived code within the Linux utilities is still under the 
UCB license. If you are worried about your own work then include your own
license that makes it free, requires whatever redistribution you want but
does not place it in the public domain. A lot of people do this, and any
code under that form of license you cannot just alter and 'Gnuify' as it
would be a derivative work of your original. A lot of well known software
is redistributed this way. The important thing is that you make it freely
redistributable (barring your own restrictions) and _NOT_ public domain.

For a real paint program, and quite a nice one have a look at Xpaint. it compiles

There is some free/gnu fax software around. I don't know if it compiles
under Linux, but I would be suprised if it didn't. It has some fairly
precise requirements on fax standards for your faxmodem.

Subject: HELP!!! I can't boot and can't install linux.
From: hjstein@sunrise.huji.ac.il (Harvey J. Stein)
Date: 19 Apr 93 14:39:41


I've been trying to get linux to boot on my 486sx at home.  It's a
nice machine, except for an el-cheapo clone motherboard.  I tried
using the SLS boot disk (downloaded from the tsx-11 mirror on
src.doc.ic.ac.uk in mid-February, SLS version 99pl2, according to the
readme file), and I tried using the boot99pl2 boot disk (also from the
tsx-11 mirror on src.doc.ic.ac.uk).  Both give the same results.  What
happens is that after getting the "Loading......" message with the
requisite 100 some odd dots, I get the message about SVGA detected,
hit <return> to select or hit <space> to continue.  Now, one of two
things happens.  Either I hit return, the screen goes into 50 line vga
mode and the machine reboots, or I hit space, and the machine reboots.

So, to check the files and my procedure, I slipped the SLS boot disk
into a Nixdorf 386sx up at school.  It booted, I tried the root disk,
and the root disk worked too!  Great!  The boot99pl2 disk also worked
fine.

The only difference between booting at school and booting at home
(aside from the machines) is that the school machine has a 3.5"
floppy as drive A, and my machine as a 5.25" floppy as drive A, so I
had to use rawrite to make two sets of disks, one in each size.

So, in that I would like to use Linux, I'm posting this message in the
hopes that someone might have an idea for me to try.  If that fails,
it will give an example of a system which won't run Linux, or at least
one which *I* can't get Linux running on.

So far, I've tried fiddling with bios settings, namely turning caching
on and off, turning adaptor rom shadowing on and off, and turning the
"Fast Gate A20 Option" on and off (whatever that is).  I also tried
pulling all my cards except for the video card and the disk
controller, and unplugged everything from the disk controller card
except for the 5.25" A drive.  However, I wasn't systematic enough to
try all possible combinations of bios settings with this minimal
hardware setup.  I did read the FAQ (and all other documentation that
I found), though.

I've never had trouble with dos software, extended dos software
(demacs), windows 3.1, Turbo Pascal, Digitalk's Smalltalk/V for
Windows, ghostscript, etc, so I really don't know what to try next.

So, what could be the problem with my home machine?  Why would it
click through and suddenly reboot itself?  Are there any test suites
that I can run to see what the problem might be?  Any things to try
out?  Is the weird video card (see below) freaking out linux?  Do I
have to trade in my motherboard?  I hope not!  All help will be
appreciated.  I can't wait to rid my machine of that virus called
MSDOS.  A company which tries to trademark the word "windows" is a
company that I'd like to do without!

Reading a lot about the work on a QIC80 driver for I would like to know if 
there is already something ready to use, or at least where if it`s ready to

Will `it` be working with the CMS DJ20, attached to the floppycontroller

Better yet, there's a port of mailx floating around.  Get and install
that.  The problem is that edmail (which on SLS is /bin/mail) bypasses
smail (a.k.a. sendmail).  The mail program provided with mailx doesn't
suffer from this drawback.  I think I got mine from sunsite, but it
should be available from most sites.

Your best bet would be NFS over SL/IP.  But your communication would be
limited to serial line speeds instead of disk speeds (or ethernet speeds).
(No, I haven't done it, SL/IP hasn't been released for the standard network
kernel yet, and this is the place where the KA9Q SL/IP falls a little short.)

Subject: Shared memory for driver at C0000H available?
Date: 19 Apr 1993 14:01:14 GMT

I indent to write an driver for intelligent ISDN-cards from
Diehl (Germany). This cards offer an interface the layer 3 of
D-channel and of B-channel too. From Diehl you get an hexdump
of the os and the protocol stack which can be downloaded to the 
card (in Germany 1TR6, in Europe EURO-ISDN, in America ???).

The problem for me just now is how I can reserve the memory
from C0000H to C2000H (or from C2000H-C4000H......) where these
cards are writing and reading all informations. I read the driver
guide from Robert Baruch (quite a good thing!) and saw that it's 
very easy to install an driver itself. But how can I get the driver 
to read the buffer which is used by the ISDN-card and how can I protect
that buffer from other applications? 

Any hints are wellcome!

Thanks in Advance.....

Yes, unfortunately they are copyrighted. So you have to steal them yourself.
On comp.sys.cbm there are hints on how to do it, but I can give you some myself:

Use x1541.exe (somewhere on 
ccosun.caltech.edu
in /pub/rknop
)

To transfer files between PC and a c64 serial diskdrive.

make the files 'basic' and 'kernel' on your c64 by a little basic-program
peeking the basic rom (0xA000-0xBFFF) and the kernel rom (0xE000-0xFFFF) and writing
them to files.

Er, the controller is an ST506. 
Here we go again: the IBM PS/2 isn't just one machine: anything below
a model 70 is at best a 286, so they can't run Linux. For those I
would suggest Minix.
The models 70 and 90 have an ESDI controller, for which I haven't seen
a driver for Linux yet.
If you have a model 80, it contains a ST506 controller. Thilo Schuster
(schuster@isa.de) has written a driver for it. Contact him for the
details. Last thing I realised was that it was written for an old kernel,
and it wouldn't compile with a kernel 0.99.6 or newer. I tried to
figure it out, compared his driver to the standard hd driver, compared
it to the Minix ST506 driver, but the stuff is just to complex to handle.
I can uuencode you the old boot&rootdisk, if you like. I still use
it.

If you have a token ring card or anything else that isn't an Ethernet
card, WD8003 compatible, you're out of the game. I'm sorry.

I definately would like to make a statement here: we SHOULD pull in
the IBM PS/2 people before they release version 1.0. So I would like
to see some enthousiastic programmers to do some dirty work for Linux.
IBM's marketshare is just to high to ignore.

Subject: Minor GCC problems.
Date: 19 Apr 1993 14:09:19 GMT

Let's consider a normal struct:
struct foo {
      char gcc_bug_save;
      type_1 var_1;
      type_2 var_2;
      ...       ...
} foo;

and an initialisation (which I produce with a flex program from
a field table):
struct field {
      int fld_offset;
      char fld_name;
      int fld_length;
      ...
} fields[] = {
      { (void *)&foo.var_1 - (void *)&foo, "field_1", ... },
      { (void *)&foo.var_2 - (void *)&foo, "field_1", ... },
      ...
};

Everything works fine with the gcc_bug_save line. If I delete it,
GCC 2.2.2d stops with a fatal segmentation violation signal sent
to cc1, while GCC 2.3.3 tells me, that the value of the initializer
to fields[0].fld_offset cannot be determined at load time.

There are no problems in initializing all the other fields, and
there are no problems, too, if I move the var_1 off the zero
position using the gcc_bug_save work-around.

I would call it an unsopported feature of gcc, if the address
calculation failed at all times, but I'm very surprised, that
it fails only for the result zero.

I tried all these, before I found out, that there is the offsetof()
macro, which should do all the calculations correctly.

=================================================================
Some programmers (at least those, who wrote postgres) use NULL as
a general value for zero, neglecting whether they needed an int
or zero pointer. Could GCC stop print warnings when the conversion
back to integer is done? I know that there are some problems like
pointers being unsigned while integers are signed by default, but
they should not appear, then just assigning or initializing a
value or comparing for being equal, not equal.

Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 14:20:54 GMT

Hello Linuxperts,

I have been a happy user of Linux for about a year now.  I run it
on a desktop at home and am very happy with it.  I now need to do
some mobiLinux-ing.  I want to buy a laptop to run Linux + X11R5.  
The hardware list (and the faq) says that Linux + X will run on most 
laptops.  This means there must be some of you out there who are 
laptop linuxers.  I would like very much to hear your suggestions 
regarding which laptop to buy.  I am considering a Toshiba 1850 
(386SX/25MHz) + 387 + whatever else it needs to run Linux (like more 
memory, etc.).

Hope to hear from you soon (I am visiting the D.C. area for a week
and they have this HUGE computer stores called COMP-USA where the prices
seem reasonable).  If I hear favorable responses I might buy a laptop
right here to take back home.

Many thanks,

Anurag Shankar

hmm... not that I am an authority on RISC ;-) but I clearly remember
reading that the instruction set on RISC CPUs is rather large.
The difference is in addressing modes - RISC instruction sets are not
as orthogonal is CISC.

I know this is probably a dumb question, just send me gentle
email telling me why it's a dumb question, please.  Maybe I'm
just confused about what constitutes "booting".

Looking through the INDEX.whole file from sunsite, I see the
chboot is in system/Linux-boot, but, as I read it, a compiiled
rdev isn't available at all, and rdev.c is under systems/Misc.

I would think there should be a link in Linux-boot to rdev,
at least, and that rdev should be supplied compiled.  I know
that rdev also slices bread and all, but the way it can change
the image on the boot diskette to point to a new root is 
a prominent feature.

Is it impossible to provide a compiled rdev that would work
for everyone?  The program recently saved me perhaps 9 hours
of grief when I had to make my linux hard disk be disk b;

"Ownership" of intellectual property comes down to the ability to control its

"Used to".

Just about everyone but the FSF has quit this sort of rubbish. Some require

Hi Ron

some months ago I ported the program fig2dev by fixing some bugs and compiling
it. The binary incl. man page is available from ftp site

        ftp.dfv.rwth-aachen.de

in the directory

        pub/linux/wunder
        
If the binary doesn't work on your system just write aa e-mail to me and I
will try to find a solution.

Hope that helps,
Marcus

I recompiled xdm with shadow passwords under 99pl7 and I don't have
any problems with it after upgrade to 99pl8.

Hello-

I'm trying to get my Linux box to talk to my Mountain Tape drive.  The tape
drive works fine from DOS, but I have to go through its proprietary
software to do so; of course, this software doesn't run under Linux.  How
can I use this tape drive from Linux?  I suppose I need to write a 
device name/driver for it?  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks, 

Walt

The .99.pl8 has a load of 3 with no (CPU consuming) processes running

Are you saying that code produced by a GPL compiler is forced to be under the
GPL? If so, you are wrong. I can use gcc to make an application, link in a
GPL'd library, and sell the whole thing for thousands of dollars while keeping
the source code in a locked safe in Siberia. The only restriction the GPL
imposes is that programs that contains actual GPL'd source code must fall under
the GPL. (Note: linking in a library != using source code.)

(Kill now if you don't live near boston; I TOLD it to post to ne,

Is there a Boston Linux users group, or anything like it? (BCS
must have a unix group, is it of interest to linux users?)
If you know of anything or want to know what I find out,
send mail.

WTH for, when there's so much electronic support?: Play with
networking/uucp as local phone calls.  Advocate/support use of Linux
in local (Jr./High) school computer labs.  Maybe have classes where
beginners like me can all kick in a few bucks to pay someone to tutor
us in fixing up and compiling messed up kernel distribution, or
introduce us to X.

What's linux?  See the FAQs in the usual places and comp.os.linux.
Linux is a free unix-like os for 386 s/x+ PCs, needs 4meg/60 meg (but
a gig is probably more comfortable...)  Does it run #$%@$#?  Probably.
At sunsite.unc.edu there's a document: /pub/Linux/INDEX.whole that
mentions a lot of what runs.

to have more than one Smalltalk program running (each in its own environment)

I think this has gone *way* over the edge.  I'm no fan of Apple, I think
their interface is restrictive and their hardware is overpriced.  
Still, I don't think they're inherently evil or anything...they aren't killing
people.  They do like to sue at the drop of a hat but they're far from the
only ones in this lawsuit-happy country of ours :-).

1) Make directory /X
2) Do a "mount /dev/whatever /X" in /etc/fstab
3) Do a "ln -s /X /usr/X386" (first make sure you don't already have a
                              directory /usr/X386 - if so do "rm -r ..." 
                              and kill it)
4) Re-boot, make sure your new file system (/X) can be found an /usr/X386.
5) #menu   (one of the options allows you to install X.  Select it)
6) Check your /usr/X386/lib/X11/Xconfig.
7) If your VGA is < 512K you must use X386mono (ln -s X386mono X)
8) Make sure you have LOTS of coffee when you get to step 6!!!

I've put the new version of acctkit onto sunacm.swan.ac.uk. This version
contains diffs relative to 0.99.8 + linus little patch. It adds the acct()
syscall and comes with the BSD NET-2 lastcomm and accton commands ported to it.

acctkit lets you see who has run what, when and for how long. It implements
only the basic accounting facilities. It's rather hard to account disk blocks
and the like on a VFS based machine.

In libc 4.3.3, there is minimum support for g++ in DLL. BTW, you need

Problem is when you're doing a demo on the road (which is what the fellow with
the pentium was doing), THERE IS NO FILE SERVER!!! which means rebuilding
your disk from floppy...you trash the disk on a road demo machine and it
will probably take a couple of hours to set things up again and just get the
system running, not to mention the time needed to "tune" the system and get the
demos running the way they are supposed to. Unless the guy doing the demo had
a complete backup machine, I don't blame him at all for being unwilling to
boot the linux disk...

I am loading LILO for the first time and having alot of problems. I did
try to read as much as possible so I won't have to bug anyone for help
but here I am once again !!! I have the following config:

        Linux OS: SLS 1.0
        LILO:     0.9

        HardDisk: SCSI (UltraStor 34F / Maxtor LXT340SY)

        /dev/sda1: dos partition
        /dev/sda2: Linux root (E2FS - Second extended file system)
        /dev/sda3: swap
        /dev/sda4: other (E2FS - Second extended file system)

I have the disktab file ready with the proper SCSI entries and my config
file looks like the following:

boot = /dev/sda
compact

map = /Image
label = linux
root = /dev/sda2

other = /dev/sda1
table = /dev/sda
label = msdos


when I boot, all I get is LI on the screen and then it hangs (forerver,
that is). I have tried several combination in my config file but no go.
I followed the "A Fun Guide by Matt Weish" but no go. If I boot from
floppy (without LILO) everything works like a charm. Can someone help me
!!!!. Thanks is advance.

Just out of curiosity, I remember awhile back that AT&T was suing BSDI
for copyright infringement, or something along those lines. I also 
remember that BSD386 (the BSDI product) and 386BSD were originally one
and the same, being developed by the Jolitz's and friends. At some point
a feud broke out and 386BSD (the free product) seperated from BSD386
(the commercial product). Now, does the AT&T suit against BSDI affect
386BSD in any way ?

There seems to be no email-address of Robert Baruch in the documents,
so I post this here:

The explanation of the ioctl-function in drivers.doc is erratic.
Robert writes:

  static int driver_ioctl(struct inode *inode, struct file *file,
                          unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
                                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Arguments: inode    -- pointer to the inode structure for this device
           file     -- pointer to the file structure for this device
           cmd      -- the user-defined command to perform
           arg      -- the user-defined argument.  You may use this
                       as a pointer to user space, since sizeof(long)==
                       sizeof(void *).                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ioctl-call is delared for the struct file_operations in
linux/fs.h, where the last argument is an unsigned int. The compiler
complains, so this is easily found, but you can't use it as pointer
into user space anymore.

Other than that, thanks Robert for your nice intro.

Hank.

In ObjectStore's User Guide, it says "When data referenced by the application
is not in main memory, a page fault occurs.  ObjectStore automatically 
intercepts it, and dynamically pages the referenced data from the 
ObjectStore database into virtual memory."  I am puzzled by this statement.

So, my first question is how can ObjectStore intercept the page-faults.
The second question is how can ObjectStore do paging without interference
to regular paging of UNIX?

Thanks a lot.

        In the Washington Post Business section today there is advertised
a 386SX40 motherboard for $99.00.  If one added memory at $33.00/Mb one
could have a Linux compatible system for about $250.00, by using the parts
from the 286 system.

I have NO  experiences especially with the Minix-fs, but I use Unix,Linux,Irix,
whatever. From 20 crashes I have seen here on a commercial UNIX system
for a IBM-PC-clone it happened about 20 times that a this fs was not reperable.

I don't think, you can say, Unix filesystems all always rather save, this
can extremly differ in different implementations of unix.

I think this question should go into the FAQ, since it is asked quite often.
There is some information on the format of Root- and Bootsector in Ralf
Brown's Interrupt list. If this is not enough, you can consult the share-
ware databases HelpPC and Dosref. They contain all the information you need.
These packages are available from simtel-mirrors in

Hiyo,

I got a prob with my Deskpro 386/20: I can't install Linux.
After checking all the hardware I have (2 serial, 1 parallel,
AHA1542B, Conner 200MB SCSI) the kernel tries to reset my
harddisk controller and fails. This it does in an indefinite loop.
Any controller I care to try (AT-Bus, MFM ...) produces the same
effect. On a NONAME 486 with AT-Bus HD it works just fine.
Has anyone encountered similar problems or is anybody running
Linux on a Deskpro 386/20 already ?
Please help me.

  I'm having a bit of trouble compiling/running DOSEMU. I got the latest
dosemu from sunsite, and I tried to follow the installation to the letter.
To my surprise, it worked! However, after a few runs, it started locking up
(at startup), and then after I fooled with it enough, it didn't lockup,
but core dumped. I'm very annoyed (since I was JUST about to install
the one DOS app I can't do without), since I actually _had_ it working..

  If anyone's got the new dosemu (0.48) working, please e=mail me. I'd like
to know how you did it, so I can do it too. <-:

Subject: AST Power Exec users unite!
Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 14:21:16 GMT

Just a quick note to poll for AST power exec owners who use or would
like to use linux.  Please excuse the wide audience of this posting,
but I don't know any other way to find the people I need to find.  I
have also included some accurate info on the display for which I have
seen mis-information posted recently.

If you fall into the category above, I would like to hear from you so
that we can combine our influence to get AST to stop stalling and
solve one or two very solvable problems with the bios.  I have been
having a tough time getting cooperation or even returned phone calls
from AST support.

Before I get into the problems I want to point out some of the strong
points of this machine.  It really does run for at least 4 hours on a
full charge (I have the 486SL system).  The power management is
*MOSTLY* transparent to the OS.  Linux runs fine with the power cord
connected and also runs fine on batterys with a few minor mods.  In
spite of what AST says, the vga chip in the system does support
1024x768x16 and windows drivers for this mode even come with the
system.  The display is the best 64 gray passive display I have seen
though the keyboard could be better.

I have been working with my 1 week old AST power exec and have found
some small but annoying problems with the setup and battery hot keys.
Just for the record, all the other power management functions operate
as they should, though not all are completely transparent (extra
interrupts).

Now a short summary of the problems.  The setup and battery keys when
activated under linux (or when the battery display activates due to low
power) do not display properly and under the 2.05 version of the bios
leave the linux screen in an unusable (black) condition.  Under the
2.10 bios the battery display screen though unreadable is at least
restored to use by linux after the three second time out (the setup
screen would be too if you could remember how to exit it without
seeing it).

The operation of these hot keys are designed to be transparent to the
the OS.  It seems they just didn't get some of the video setup right.

Even though it shouldn't matter what I am running when I use these
features, they have hesitated to work on the problem after they heard
I was running some free software called linux which they had never
heard of.  If you have any commercial software or operating system which
displays the same problem, let me know.

I also have problems with the system hanging a second after I turn it
on (the second power cycle always works).  If you have seen this I
would like to know also.

Thanks.

Ok..  Everything, for the most part, seems to be back to normal once
again..  Sometimes I wonder why I keep upgrading the kernel since it just
leads to about three days worth of work to get all everything functioning
normally once again..  In any event..  I noticed this problem back in 0.97
and it still seems to be present..  Is it me>??

I'm now running 0.99PL7A.  I have a modem running off of getty_ps2.0.7 uugetty
with no problems..  It answers and works fine..  Here's the funny part.  If
you try to ls a large directory or if you're running a screen oriented
piece of software that sends a lot of info to the screen at once, it will
suddenly just kill the remaining characters and pause..  If you hit the enter
key, it pops you back to your prompt(if you were doing an ls) or it continues
on as if it had finished what it was printing out(even if you didn't see it..)
Any clues??  BTW..  In retrospect, the modem speed might be important since I
could see it being a time out situation..  I'm dialing into the system at
2400..  Hmmm..

Well, the UNIX access bits is really only an ACL compressed into nine

ACL's in /etc/group; then you wouldn't even need anything in the file
system.  However, that is rather clumsy and only possible as root.

The advantage of ACL's over rwx bits is that ACL's provide a lot more
fine-grained control of who can access what files.  There is nothing
that keeps it from working with rwx bits.

I just checked if ingres was included in tsx-11.mid.edu and it is...
But I thought Ingres was a commercial package!

Does somebody give me an explanation of this fact?

What does Ingres include in the tsx-11 package?
        (Monitor, Embedded SQL, etc.?)

As a DBMS and concerning the speed, can anybody give me an idea of
        benchmarks?

nik,
I started using MGR back when I first got linux at .98pl5. I did this because
I didn't have a decent video car that would do X. 

Anway, 

PROS 

It is FAST! Much faster than Xwindows even when X is running monochrome. It
did resolutions 800x600 and lower with no problems. I couldn't get higher
resolutions because I believe my Trident 8900B SVGA card wouldn't cooperate.

It was fairly easy to setup. Much easier to configure than Xwindows.

The library was easier to program than Xwindows stuff. MGR theoretically will
let you run remotely over a serial line fairly fast. This would give you
basically the equivalent of an MGRterminal without having to do anything
fancy. No one that I know of has actually done this but that is mainly
because MGR just hasn't caught on like it probably should. The src for MGR is
incredibley small so you can browse through it and make mods to your hearts
content. Very small ie. doesn't use much memory. 

CONS

Lack of apps. Only apps that I found were the 15 that came with the package.
Other than that they are nonexistant. I don't think it does color either but
I haven't played with it since I got Xwindows to work.

Now that I think about it, I think I will go pull it down again.

Subject: ms busmouse problem +
Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 19:05:19 GMT

I'm experiencing some problems with my microsoft bus mouse and X.

I had pl6 running from tsx-11 with no problmes.... then I decided to install pl8.

After untaring  and recompiling the kernel, X no longer recognizes the mouse, giving
a message something like:

        core devices not found

The kernel compile went without any problems; also, there is a /dev/bmousems
linked to /dev/mouse, with minor 2.

Any clues?

Also, being an unsure neophyte, I'm a little confused as how to change patch levels
(like, I'm I doing the right thing...)

Specifically, is it alright to upgrade from pl6--->pl8 with out first going through pl7A?

Or, should I use the diff's instead?

Thanks-in-advance,

Bob

A dirty trick:
Use xmodmap to map the arrow keys to CRTL-b CRTL-f CRTL-p CRTL-n.
Works in most applications like bash, ksh, emacs, joe ...

If it doesn't compress then you write it out to the full size block
(the non-compressed stuff).  There are at least 2 blocksizes.

You don't get perfect disk savings of course.  If you maintain four
possible block sizes, for example, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, then you
pick the one that the compressed size is closest too and smaller.  You
ignore the rest of the block.

I've been programming since I was 10 (13 years ago) starting with BASIC

and have been programming in C++ for about 5 months now.

I'm currently working as a sysadmin for several SCO Unix (another gag) systems.
I mainly keep some multi-processor systems at hospitals running...
I'll be graduating with a BSCS in June (in addition to my BS psychology).

This sounds kinda like a resume!  Does anyone out there have a job opening
for a young programmer or sysadmin?  I'm perfectly willing to relocate
anywhere in the world.  I know French, some Italian, and some Norwegian.

Just thought I'd throw that in...

I just found out that ICP has the 1660 back in stock at $58 (+s/h). My next choice
would have been an Adaptec 1522 for $95. Future Domain has a good reputation as

I had the same problem. In order to get the arrow keys to work under  
X-windows emacs (in regular emacs in fact), I had to import? the file  
vt100.el or .elc, I'm not sure. I read it in a random piece of  
documentation. If you're emulating another console type, you might want to  
use a different file. This file should be where the rest of the lisp files  
are. The only problem I've encountered is that my backspace key still  
responds as a Ctrl-H, instead of as a delete key.

The memory at physical address 0xA0000 - 0xFFFFF is reserved under
linux, and will not be used as normal memory.  Drivers are fit do do
with it as they see fit, and if you really want to, you can also do a
mmap() on /dev/mem to get to the memory from user space.  So you don't
need to reserve anything, and as kernel memory is 1:1 with physical
memory (ignoring a lot of VM/segment juggling), any kernel drivers that
want to use the memory can just read/write to it directly.

        Ditto...  I'm sure if Michael Will looked long enough and hard
enough at his favorite company, he'd find they were doing bad things too. 
Does that mean he isn't going to support their practices by not buying stuff
from them?  Of course not.  He'd never eat, wouldn't own a car, wouldn't
have a job because of course working for a company with questionable
business practices would be EVEN WORSE...

Has a logo been picked yet?

The reason I ask is because I cannot seem to print out some of the .ps
files due to postscript incompatibilities, so I have not seen all the
choices.

Of the ones I have seen, my vote is for the one which pretty much
was straight text across an inverted triangle (Linux release 0.97)

I'd rather not see animal mascots in a logo; but I *AM* for picking
a mascot for use in other ways.

There *is* a use for flowcharts:  I have found that non-programmers
(lawyers, managers, etc...) can read understand them much better than
pseudo-code, state machines, and transition diagrams.  They look pretty,
and they're graphical, so they don't scare the people who wear business
suits.

I use flowcharts when I want to make a non-programmer understand a
algorithm.

Date: 19 Apr 1993 20:11:33 GMT


Guten Tag!

After the installation of the tk/tcl package on my Linux system a little
problem occured:

The man pages from the distribution try to include a file "man.macros"
with the command ".so man.macros". Unfortunately, I did not find such
a file neither in the distribution nor between the standard groff/nroff/
troff macro packages. The man packages are readable without this "man.macros"
file but look really bad.

Where can I find this file "man.macros"? Can anybody send it to me? Is it
on some ftp server?

The tk/tcl package which I did install on my system is distributed in these
files:

        -rw-rw-r--  1 linuxadm     8429 Mar 31 17:27 tclDiffs.tar.z
        -rw-rw-r--  1 linuxadm   416043 Mar 30 09:44 tclDist.tar.z
        -rw-rw-r--  1 linuxadm   232283 Mar 30 09:36 tclMan.tar.z

It seems as if they contain tk 3.2 and tcl 6.5.

Thank you in advance!

        The Adaptec low-level driver has a no-op for the abort function.  This
means that if a command times out, that the kernel essentially continues to
wait for it to complete and no attempt is made to kill the currently running
command.  If you do not get messages about I/O errors, then this means that the
command completed normally and you have nothing to worry about.

        It would concern me a little to get these messages, however, because
this indicates that once in a while the commands take much longer to complete
that would normally be expected, and this means that you may have data errors
somewhere on the disk (It will take the disk longer to read some particular
sector(s) because it needs to retry the operation or use ECC to clean up the
bad version of the sector).

   I'm using linux on a Bernoulli 'PC Powered Pro 90' right now.

   But it won't work with IOMEGA's controller, unless someone writes a
   driver for it.  I bought an adaptec 1542 and it works great with it.

I took a look at the card, and it looks like it might by possible to
use the Seagate/Future Domain driver, just from the numbers on the
chip.  I don't know what modifications would be needed, though.  Also,
I can't test my assertions, becase the machine doesn't have linux on
it, doesn't belong to me, and is about 200 km away...

However, it looked like the chip might be a version of the same chip,
and might work.  It's worth a try, unless it's already been shown to
be false.  Maybe?

I hope this will clear it up :

(Taken from one of my lecture notes)

 " ...  The alternative approach (to CISC),
 which has been adopted by many in
 recent years, has come to be known as "RISC": the Reduced
 Instruction Set Computer.  This can be characterised simply as
 "Simpler is Faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing
 the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be
 designed to run faster.  Even at the cost of needing more
 instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,
 faster design.

 A typical RISC processor will:

    o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);

    o perform all data operations on registers;

    o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');

    o only allow load & store operations to access memory;

    o only use a few instruction formats;

    o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).

Subject: Memory Bad ?
Date: Sat, 17 Apr 1993 17:12:46 GMT

Hi !

Lately I upgraded my computer from 386SX to 386DX with 4 MB and had no
problems at all.
After a memory upgrade to 8 MB I sometimes get error messages like the
following:

Bad page table: [003ffff4]=00000800
copy_page_tables: bad page table: probable memory corruption
Bad page table: [0009fff4]=00002800

Is the second number the real memory address ?
Should I try to replace the first bank of RAM  ?

My configuration:

Linux 99pl7 w/o X
2x ST3144A

Motherboard:
M321 PC Chips
386DX/40 128KB Cache / no dirty tag ram
8MB 70ns RAM


(DOS and Windows runs fine)

Any hints are very welcome.

Ingres was originally a research project of the University of
California at Berkeley.  As such it was made freely available to anyone
who wanted it.  It was later spun-off as a commercial product but the
original implementation remains freely available.  This does not, of
course, include the add on goodies such as SQL support, QBE front-ends
and so forth that businesses like to spend big bucks on.

Yes. Please wait for a few more weeks. It is undergoing testing. That
is all I can say. Please don't email me for more info. I don't know
when it will be available or how much it will cost. And things may change
at the last miniute. I won't answer any questions.

 We have finished porting Motif 1.2.1 to Linux with support for shared 
libXm and will be selling it once we have tested it a bit more. Overall, 
Motif is working well under Linux (0.99pl6 with libc 4.3.3).

Apparently, there is code to release; everyone knows you flowchart after
you program and because it is a course requirement, not because the things
are useful compared to real engineering tools like structure diagrams,
state transition tables,  operation precedence lists, simulation models, and
the resulting profiling data.  I'd be happier with meaningful function names
and the output of cxref (which I can run myself, thank you).

The two places I have seen flow charts in the real world were to sell IBM
flowcharting forms (like printer spacing charts, except they couldn't
serve a useful purpose in a second life as 1:1.5 scale graph paper) and in
the museum of science and industry.

What I do is !term &, then quit.  Term gets run, Kermit
goes away, and since term is now on the modem tty, DTR
won't go low.  Works fine in bash.

Personally, I feel that suspending Kermit *should* suspend
the calling script.  However, tcsh is broken enough that it
might let you do what you want.  (Followups to alt.religion.shells.)

Date: 19 Apr 93 18:49:18 GMT

A big part of GNUism is to prevent people from taking unrestricted-copyright
programs, and creating restricted-copyright or proprietary programs. 
It is ironic that GNUites are violating their own philosophy by converting
unrestricted software into restricted software. 

Software that is ``really free'', that is, released without restrictions,
provides benefits to EVERYBODY.  Everybody includes people who create
GNUified software, as well as those who create commercial software.

As an aside, because GNUified software releases source code, it is easy 
to incorporate changes made to really-free programs back into the
original code, as copyright does not cover cases where
there is substantially no other way to do something, which 
would cover most bugfix-type changes.

There are some things you might be interested to know about today's RISC
processors.  It is true that there are fewer instructions, but what is 
not commonly known is that this causes the size of your executables to
swell, so that in some cases performance is similar for larger applications.
As a compromise, many RISC processors today are actually a cross between
a Reduced Instructions Set, and a Complex one.

This is not to say that there is no future in CISC processors, Intel has 
certainly proved that.

What I want to know, is what does this have to do with this group?

Has anyone had the following problem with the new (april 18 ?)
SLS a1.3 disk , if s{ how did you get it to work ?

I downloaded the a1.3 file and used rawrite to put it on a 3.5 disk.
After trying to boot, LILO appeared on the screen. At this time I
pressed the alt key (both were tried) but nothing more happened, Linux
didn't load, and my computer locked up.  I have looked at the faqs
and don't really even understand how LILO can operate from a floppy. 
The old two disk install version of SLS appeared to work ok.
Any help would be appreciated.

I have just finished installing SLS 1.01 (the April 18th version) on my laptop
at home this afternoon. The a1.3 disk worked fine on my AST Powerexec machine.
I'm not sure what the problem you had was. I also didn't understand why you
tried the alt key. I have never used LILO before so maybe that's how you select
where to boot from. But in any case, I just placed the disk in the machine,
turned it on and everything went smoothly from there. The new release is much
better than the old one interms of the clarity it presents to a newbie. There
is however one problem with it: it asks for the T4 disk which doesn't seem to
exist. I haven't tested it out yet so I'm not sure if it's just a bug or Peter
forgot to upload the T4 disk (and this would be a new one).

Making a binary with gcc and selling it sans source is legal, yes.
Linking that binary with a GPL'd lib and selling *that* sans source is
prohibitted in the *L*GPL... However selling your binary code linked
with the GPL'd lib and distributing the source to the GPL'd library

I don't understand this.  If someone decides to do some work and give the
work away, and they put no restrictions on it, why should you care what
people do with it?  Using as an example the rather large FreeWare project
that I am involved in (XFree86), we knew from the day we started it that
people would likely commercialize some or all of it.  It takes a lot of
chutzpah to be in business.  We didn't have the guts/desire/whatever to
take the work commercial.  We also didn't believe in putting restrictions
that were completely unenforcable (from an economic, if not a legal, 
standpoint).  We tell people "You can do whatever you want with this, 
except claim you wrote it.  And we'd appreciate it if you gave us credit
for the work we did."  Why hang some rediculous requirements like the GPL
on it, when we have no intention/desire/resources to enforce it?

I know for a fact that there are several commercial ventures that are
using some or all of XFree86.  Many of these came to us ahead of time
and said "Do you have any problems with our doing this?"  Several
have come to us after the fact and said "We did this.  Do you mind?".
I'm sure there are others who haven't bothered to talk to us.

We in fact have a friendly relationship with all of these folks.  One
has contributed code back to the project.  A couple of others may as 
well.  

If it doesn't bother us, who have put thousands of hours into it, why
in the world does it bother you?

If you put something in the public domain, then you give up all rights to it.
In fact, most of the software that people call "public domain" is actually
in fact "Free Redistributable Copyrighted Software" (or some such nonsense).
You can put any restriction you want on your code.  And attempt to enforce
it if you like.  But if you really put it in the public domain, you have
lost all control.  Hence you have no right to bitch.

If you write software with no intention of commercial gain, and you
enjoy what you are doing, why should you care what anyone else does
with the software?  If you put a copyright on the stuff, then you
still own it.  Unless someone tries to prevent you from doing what
your are doing, it should have absolutely no impact on your life.

Oh, bull cookies.  We started XFree86 because we wanted to improve the
performance of the X11R5 server.  Then we expanded the project.  Why
do we do it?

        1) We can add a lot of support for things that weren't supported
           before (e.g. 386BSD and Linux), and make it available to people
           who aren't going to be supported by the commercial ventures.
        2) We can learn a hell of a lot about a lot of topics we'd never
           dealt with.
        3) We enjoy it.

My motivation for continuing with this is that I am still learning and
still enjoying what I am doing.  True, I have gained a fair measure of
recognition from this work, and I appreciate that.  But it was never
my intention, nor does it have anything to do with why I continue.  I
would do this even without the recognition.

FreeWare can coexist quite well with commercial alternatives.  There
is far more cooperation, good will, interaction, etc, between the
XFree86 Core Team and the commercial "competitors" than most people
are aware of.  Largely because we realize where our niche in the market
is.  This is actually one of the most refreshing and gratifying things
about the project - there is very little competition, just a lot of
hard work and cooperation.

The GPL doesn't protect anyone unless they have the resources to try to
enforce it.  The GPL provides no more protection against copyright
violation than any other copyright does.  Perhaps FSF and LPF have
the financial and legal muscle to try to enforce it.  But the "little
guy" doesn't.  So why sweat it?  If you're doing what you want to do,
why do you care what someone else does?

Various companies commercializing XFree86 isn't going to make us go
away.  People who want free X will still get it from us - if they
were willing to pay for commercial packages, there are already several
options available.

Don't try to explain why we do what we do, if you have never done anything
of the same scale.  Don't tell us what should annoy/bother/offend/upset
us - we are not stupid; we knew all of this going in.  Don't tell us that
we need to put rediculous, unenforcable restrictions on our code to
protect some "rights" that aren't in jeopardy to start with.

It's 386BSD, BTW, to which you refer.  BSD/386 IS a commercial product.

And your last statement is EXACTLY the point - why bother with superfluous
things like the GPL when the software will remain free anyhow?

Subject: questions from a new linux user.
Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 18:05:42 GMT

I just installed linux yesterday from SLS 1.01 and I have a few questions
about things that happened along the way. My configuration is:
        386awp motherboard w/386dx33 and 64k direct mapped cache
        ami 5/5/91 bios and opti chipset
        4mb in 3 chip SIMMS
        2 IDE drives. the first is a western digital 120mb and the second
        is a samsung 3101A 100mb drive. (probably made by seagate based
        on the model number)
        microsoft mouse, trident svga w/1mb and 8900c chipset.

1. I needed to configure a swap partition in order to install. (the bios
   was being shadowed so this may be normal)

2. The install wouldn't run for very long unless the cache was disabled.
   Is this a problem with the motherboard? Is the cache bad? The hardware
   list says that the 386awp w/ami bios works. will I need to run without the
   cache all the time?

3. When I got everything installed, in /lib, libm.so.4 is a link to
   libm.so.4.3.3, but there is no libm.so.4.3.3, only a libm.so.4.0. I take
   it this is a problem with the package, but is it libm.so.4.3.3 misnamed?
   How can I find out? Will just moving the link so it points to the one
   there work? Where can I get a new version of the library?

4. my IDE/serial card has 16450 chips on it. can 16550A's be put inplace of
   them? (Are they pin compatable?) Where can I get 16550A's and at what price?

Thank you for any help you can offer.

NOTE:  since this is now way off the subject of the Linux filesystem (under
power failures), and is now completely on ultra-cheap UPS systems, I'm
re-directing followups to comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware (the only .hardware
group I get here).

again, many thanks to all who have responded on this topic.  I've learned
a lot about low-end UPSs (which, until I started this, I didn't even know
existed), and if I can find $99, I won't have to worry about shutting down
quite as fast as I would before.

actually, I wasn't aware (until just now, that is) that there were UPSs of
this variety.  of course, like I said before, my experience with UPS systems
has always been the monster types.....

hmmm, I wonder if it would keep the computer and monitor going for, say,
30 seconds or so.  any idea?  I'd kinda like to have the monitor, in case
I really do need to shutdown (right now, I'm the only user...if I need to
shutdown, I use ``shutdown now'' to do it).

>       Locally, we have more problems with "power flickers" than

same here.  the longest ``outage'' I've seen here was on the order of 2
seconds or so.  of course, there were about 3 of those in a 10 second
period, too (the monitor just loved that, too....luckily, the computer's
protection circuits set in, and it didn't reboot until I turned the main
power switch off for a few seconds).

either way, for $99 (the lowest price I've heard yet), I might just try
to squeeze it into my (nonexistent) budget.

on the workstation I had at my previous job (VAX 3100 w/ Ultrix 4.2), I
never saw damage that fsck couldn't handle when the machine rebooted.
but....the first time I saw a UNIX machine (albeit a pitiful excuse for

it happened over Christmas vacation at my previous job, my first year there.
I had a ps2/80 running aix (YUCK!), and someone apparently walked into my
office and said, ``oh, Jim left his pc on...better turn it off for him....''
I came back to find a dead filesystem.

>I think, the cheapest way to protect from a crash is a frequently backup.

this is true....but since I can't use my tape drive (yet...it's coming),
that's kinda tough to do.  :-(  once there is a working QIC-40 driver, you
can bet that I'll be doing very regular backups.

Subject: Network problems with FTP
Date: 20 Apr 93 01:41:58 GMT


I have been having major problems with networking.  Telnet seems to work 
correctly from one linux box to another but FTP usually hangs.  If the file
I am trying to transfer is small it will usually work but if the file is
large (>20k) it hangs after saying "opening data connection..."  If I check on
the machine receiving the transfer, the file is usually about 4k or less.  

FTP is not the only problem.  When running other programs across the net (such
as xtrek) they will occasionally appear to "die" until I hit a key in a telnet
session to the other machine which causes all of the packets that have been 
waiting for the net to come alive again to be suddenly sent all at once.
This is very annoying.  I have tried every kernel out there and am currently
running 0.99pl8.  I have heard that there are patches for tcpip.  Where are
these patches and how can I get them?

BTW, When ftp is successful with small files, the speed is very fast (>100K 
bytes per second) It seems like a few packets are sent and then the net
"goes to sleep" for a while, then wakes up and sends some more packets, 
"goes to sleep" again, etc.  It is a continuous loop.  Occasionally it will
not "wake up" when large files are transfered.  What's going on here?  If
anyone out there has patches for this I would like to get them ASAP.
(the transfer speed with large files is about 30K bytes per second.)

Subject: Bug in termcap handling
Date: 19 Apr 1993 23:00:06 GMT

Hi there,
I just set up a micro partition on my disk (10Meg) and installed a
trim version of LINUX to see how far I really want to go in this direction.
Everything seemed okay, until I realized that the basedisks have everything
but a worthwile editor (say like an emacs clone).  Under DOS I have
used MG which is a nice, self-contained and mostly very close to GNU emacs.
Since I only found JED in the LINUX archives (at sunsite I believe) and it was
less compatible I decided to "try out" my new system by getting a copy
of the MG sources from a 386bsd archive and building it.

It took a lot longer than I thought it would.  Mostly getting the "sysv" version
to compile was not a big problem, BUT once it was built it sorta worked
but instead of a 25row by 80column display I got a 25row by 8column display!
After walking through with the debugger I discoverd that the termcap
information retrieved by "tgetent" appears to have a few extra characters
slapped into it right where the second line should begin.  There is an
extra li:25:co:8 and it is this first co:8 that yields the columns instead
of a later co:80.  Okay so MG is buggie I figure, but not knowing anything
about termcap and its ilk I go off and find this little utility (tci) that is
supposed to dump all sorts of information that the system knows about 
your terminal from the appropriate termcap entry.  Well, it reports that my
terminal has 8 columns!! This utility was from a linux archive and just
compiled and ran.  Is the termcap handling buggy, or did I get a bad copy
of the termcap library?  

As you might guess I am just an amature, with no real C experience.  I looked
on this news group for a recent bug report, but found none.  (The version of
LINUX in question is 0.99 pl7.)   Is this problem "mine-alone" or has someone
else had this problem?

Dear Net,

I was wondering if anyone has gotten the QIC-02 drivers to work under
PL8 yet?? I haven't been able to get them to work since PL6. I would
really like to back my system up, but I can't go back to older kernels
because of the changes that have occurred with xiafs since then. So
I am kind of between a rock and a hard place. Any help would be greatly
appreciated. Please don't reply to this group as my news feed is not
working right now. Please reply to either address in my .sig.

I have exactly the same problem dialing out of my system (haven't tried
it dialing in).  Any large transfer in one direction results in losing
a bunch of the data.  I thought it might be my dialup connection at first,
so I didn't speak up.  

My serial line is running at 19200 bps, with hardware flow control, crtscts 
is set properly.  I don't have this problem with text that is interrupted
(like pages with more, z-modem, etc...), though the output does pause
frequently.

Are there any new serial patches?  Am I just doing something really stupid,
or is this a real problem?

Ok, I got the phrasing wrong. What I mean to say is yes people write a
bit of software, see that with a bit of tidying up that would be useful
to other people. Now why do they bother to do the tidying up, pack it
into a tar file, stuff some docs together and then give time to other
people helping them to use it? Ok I didn't mean people sit down and think
"what can make me famous" etc etc. What I mean to say is software writers
are proud of their little creation, they think is a neat bit of coding,
solves a problem in a neat and generic way etc etc. This is in much the
same way that a painter paints a painting, or an author writes a book
(very rarely is the prime motivation money). Why is the list of credit's
at the end of a film so long? If artists didn't care, there would be no
credits. Ok no, I can't remember who wrote 'less', but I know what 'less'
is because it is so widely used and the author is probably proud that
*his* bit of software is so widely used. At least everybody acknowledges
that he wrote it, rather than DEC saying "it is part of *our* s/w
pack", implying that is has been written by them. Do you get my point?

The last version of MGR (0.54 which is apparently not on tsx-11/sunsite) uses
the selection-1.4 code which I believe supports bus mice. Whether the support
is accurate is left to the user.

Running in anything above 800x600 requires bank-switching and card-specific

I will soon be running Linux on a 386DX-40 with 8MB of main memory,
and have some questions:

First, I have a 130MB hard drive, and I want to make three partitions:
one for Linux, one for swap space, and one for various DOS products
(games, other applications). I plan to be needing X, gcc, lemacs, and
some interface toolkits (interviews, suit.)

How big should the swap space and Linux partition be? Is this OK:
        15-20MB DOS
        5-10MB  Swap
        100-110 Linux

My second question deals with MIDI: what exactly is out there for
Linux that works with MIDI - device drivers, toolkits, full-fledged
sequencers?

Thanks,

Steve

I cannot agree more with Steve's last comment.  I have made the remark 
that TAMU's installation notes should be made required reading by anybody
considering Linux :)  Dave Safford has done a great job of putting
together a release that includes extfs, olvwm(for user1), twm(for root),
lilo(working out of the box) and many others...  He also has a
philosophy of upgrades I appreciate; One should not put out a release,
that has not been compiled from the source level and completely tested, just to
get out the latest of everything.  People can always do that on their own.

This is exactly the problem I have with the GPL, it doesn't help the
computer science industry in general.  GNU is currently in a position
to contribute greatly to the computer industry.  GCC/glibc/bison/flex/etc.
are powerful tools for software development.  They also run on about
every platform.

If commercial enterprises could develop their code using these "STANDARD"
tools, it would run on all architectures "UNMODIFIED".  This could be
the best thing for everyone... developers sell more software, users can
buy software at a lower cost.  Currently every package must be ported to
every machine it should run on.

I think that GNU/LPF/FSF need to examine the GPL and see if they can
make their tools usable by EVERYONE!  Why are we wasting countless
hours having DEC/HP/Novell/Sun/etc write their own architecture specific
compilers, lib's, and windowing wigits.  I'm sure many companies would
use GCC, etc. if the GPL wasn't so viral.

I personally am looking forward to the day that I can write a piece of
code and have it run on every machine I have an account on... with no
changes.  Is GNU interested in this kind of thing also?

Subject: VGA Support
Date: Mon, 19 Apr 1993 22:59:23 GMT



I'm a student here at the U very interested in installing Linux on my PC.  My
computer is a 486DX/33-VLB, 8MB RAM, and a Western Digital WD2255 HD.  My video
card is an ATI Graphics Ultra Pro VLB with 1MB RAM.  

My question is, will Linux support my SVGA card in, at least, some VGA mode? 
My main concern is the ability to run Xwindows under linux...

If this card isn't suppored, will there be plans to do so?  I'd be nice to see a
VESA register accessing driver for SVGA cards. Hint Hint to all of you hard core
linux developers!

Please send me email:   bentlema@cda.mrs.umn.edu    
Thanks!

Any information would be GREATLY appreciated!

PL8/4.3.3 new binutils

During large compilation jobs, and probably only during linking (the
linker dies with a segmentation fault).  After that, the machine
doesn't crash, but syncing hangs.

It seems to only happen when there is more than 20 meg in swap (and
plenty free) and a heavy load on the system.

The compile/link jobs are to/from ext2 partitions, but it appears that
is the small (16 meg) root minix partition is the only one affected
after the lockup.

  Try using the the IVdoc3.01 package, it is from an older version of
Interviews, and worked on my machine last time I tried it (a while ago)
Another possible option is to recompile the doc application.  You don't
have to recompile the whole thing, and there are libraries already made
as part of the SLS release.  Actually doc is also available as part of
that release (SLS).
  Notes:1)doc crashes if there are no fonts available in /usr/lib/ps (from
memory), so make sure those are present first.  There are a few bugs in the
sources that make it possible to select multiple font sizes, and fonts.
  These can be fixed if you recompile the complete sources.
2)You need a pretty good machine 386 dx40 with math for decent performance.
3)there is very little support or documentation, so you need to be capable
 of figuring out some things.
4)I use it all the time, and it is a really useful WYSIWYG package, that can
 import postscript of idraw files.

Actually, while they aren't taught any more, I have found them quite
useful, especially in situations where the logic needs to be analyzed
often... It can also allow you to plan more easily where dividing
lines between major sets of subroutines really should fall... Thus
allowing for very clean modules and headers, as well as dividing up
the labor between people...

Besides, it's fun to play with those little template thingys and make
all the neat shapes...

Well, I just noticed that when one types 'su', and starts typing the password
before the system prompts for it (and turns off echoing), the system
still accepts it. All other unix systems that I have used never accept
passwords typed in this way; probably a fflush() before reading the password.

Just thought I ought to point this out.

I'm not taking the bait, but you can check the Sun ld and ld.so man page
to help you understand the runtime warning.  What's happening is this:
when you link term, ld looks for libc first in /lib, then /usr/lib, and
then in /usr/local/lib.  It's evidently finding libc.so.1.8 before finding
any others.  When you run the program, it looks for libc in the order
given in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  Since the Makefile.sun
file distributed with term doesn't have any -L options for ld, my guess
is that you've got multiple copies of libc laying around and your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not in the order /lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib.

I imagine that Michael's greatest headaches were caused by Sun's select()
system call.  I can't blame him for flaming Sun over that.

I will say that when I compiled term on the Sun, I got a lot of
"so and so redefined" warnings, but it works, so I didn't mind!

Yes.  Term compiled very cleanly under Linux for me.  Basically, under a
vanilla installation of the most recent release of SLS (0.99pl6-26).

(In case HJ's reading, I've updated to libc4.3.3 already.)

True.  This seems to be the major 'gotcha' for people.  I've pointed
that out to some people locally, nationally, and internationally.

If you're using X, I can't recommend Seyon highly enough.  With the
Seyon 2.12 quickKeys, it's as if Seyon and Term were made for each other.

Here's the way my Seyon 2.12 quickkeys are set up for term:

Seyon*quickKey1.visible:        True
Seyon*quickKey1.action: \
        Transmit("term^M"); ShellCommand("$term 2>/tmp/noise.log");
Seyon*quickKey1.label:          TERM
Seyon*quickKey2.visible:        True
Seyon*quickKey2.action:         Transmit("00000^M");
Seyon*quickKey2.label:          EndTerm

The noise.log is optional.  I should probably get rid of that now.

I'm very pleased with term.  Thanks a ton Michael.

p.s.  I'm only following-up to comp.os.linux, because that's the only

I don't know much about setting up a remote boot, but I have this 
suggestion:  Since every IBM-PC AT clone ever made comes with at 
least a floppy disk drive(the diskless term actually being
something of a misnomer - in this case only referring to the lack
of a hard drive)  why not exploit this fact, and write a boot disk
that consists of a small driver that initalizes the ethernet card,
finds the network, and then loads the kernel off the server?  All
the server would need is to have a daemon running that would 
recognize a call from a workstation node, and then it would send the
appropriate code to the station.  The boot driver would take care
of loading the kernel into memory.  If the boot image were
specially prepared for the workstation(s), it would load and then
call back on the network to NFS-mount the appropriate file systems,
perhaps a designated workstation root(or the server root).
It seems to me that all this would need(besides the boot disk) would
be a few modifications to the kernel code to include a NFS mounting
driver, and redirection of where the kernel looks to find the 
filesystems.  Note that two kernel images would be needed on the
server - one for the workstations and one for the server boot - 
unless some clever person could devisea kernel that would check
for the presence of a hard drive, and would proceed to boot off 
the network if it didn't find one.

Just an Idea - Please EMail me if you have any comments, or
        reasons why this may or may not be feasable(I'm still
        learning, and am happy to be corrected :-)

No, I haven't gotten a1.3 to boot yet either...  But since I
already have linux, that doesn't really matter to me.  However,
I notice that the vgaset program included is the old version.
This has two problems:

    1. IF YOU RUN IT ON A FIX FREQUENCY MONITOR YOU'LL BE 
       LUCKY IF YOU DON'T DESTROY IT!

    2. On many (all?) cards with more than 512k, verticle values
       (including frequency) are off by a factor of two for many
       video modes.

I'll contact Peter, and ask him to replace this with the safer
version.  In the mean time, if you want to use a safer version
(Xfree and vgaset are both dangerous no matter how many safty
factors are added) you can ftp from sunsite.unc.edu.  The path

Subject: Linux Doc Project `Manifesto'
Date: 20 Apr 1993 05:47:05 GMT

This is the Linux Documentation Project ``Manifesto''  -*- Outline -*-
Last Revision 19 April 1993 -- Matt Welsh (mdw@tc.cornell.edu)

This file describes the current plans and goals of the Linux Doc Project,
including a listing of ongoing projects, volunteers, FTP sites, and so on.
It should work okay with Emacs outline format.

* Overview

        The Linux Documentation Project is working on developing good, 
reliable docs for the Linux operating system. The overall goal of the LDP is 
to collaborate in taking care of all of the issues of Linux documentation, 
ranging from online docs (man pages, texinfo docs, and so on) to printed 
manuals covering topics such as installing, using, and running Linux. The LDP 
is essentially a loose team of volunteers with no real central organization; 
anyone who is interested in helping is welcome to join in the effort. We feel 
that working together and agreeing on the direction and scope of Linux 
documentation is the best way to go, to reduce problems with conflicting 
efforts--- e.g. two people writing two books on the same aspect of Linux 
wastes someone's time along the way.

        The LDP is set out to produce the canonical set of Linux online and
printed documentation. Because our docs will be freely available (as per the
GNU GPL; see below) and distributed on the net, we are able to easily update
the documentation to stay on top of the many changes in the Linux world.
There are also plans to pursue publication of the LDP manuals; of course,
since ``treeware'' is more difficult to upgrade this probably won't happen
until these technical issues stabilize.

* Getting Involved

        The canonical way to get involved with the LDP is to join the DOC
channel of the Linux-activists mailing list. To do so, send mail to:
        linux-activists-request@niksula.hut.fi 
with the line
        X-Mn-Admin: join DOC
at the top of the body (not the subject). This will add you to the mailing
list; send empty mail to the same address for instructions on using it.

        Of course, you'll also need to get in touch with the coordinator
of whatever LDP projects you're interested in working on; see the next
section.

* Current Projects

        Here is a list of ongoing LDP projects, along with their individual
coordinators. Basically, the coordination of any of these projects is 
very open-ended; just pick up the alpha version of the doc and suggest to
the coordinator changes, or ideas for something to work on. Or, just contact
the coordinator of the project and see if there's anything that needs to be
worked on. There's no "official" LDP in that sense; if you have something to 
contribute, feel free.

** Linux Installation, Setup, and Getting Started
   Matt Welsh (mdw@tc.cornell.edu)

        This is the first in a set of Linux printed manuals which will
deal with all of the issues of getting started with Linux: what Linux is,
how and where to get the software, installation, system configuration,
and introductory chapters on using Linux (and UNIX in general). This is the
one book anyone needs to read to dive into Linux, even with no previous
UNIX experience. This manual also serves as the introduction to the other
LDP manuals: chapters on introductory system administration, introduction
to using Linux, etc. 

        An Alpha version of this manual should be ready by April 93.

** Linux User's Guide
   Larry Greenfield (greenfie@gauss.rutgers.edu)

        This book will over all of the user-end aspects of Linux, from
sitting down at the first login session to using complex tools such as
gcc, emacs, and so on. It assumes no previous UNIX experience, so not only
will it serve as an introduction to Linux, but to UNIX in general as well.
This manual won't cover system administrator tasks (i.e. anything that needs
to be done as root)--- it's for the J. Random User who has a working Linux
system sitting in front of them.

        Larry says that he'll have more time to work on this during the summer,
so we should see an alpha version sometime then.

** Linux System Administrator's Guide
   Lars Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi)

        This is the third book in the main LDP series, and assumes knowledge
of everything in the Installation and User's Guides. It will cover all of the
aspects of keeping the system running, handling user accounts, backups,
configuration of the system, installing and upgrading software, and more. 
Whereas some of this information is in the Installation Guide (just to get the
system off the ground) this book should be much more complete.

        Lars has (temporarily) had to work on other projects; there is a
pre-alpha version of this manual available (for anyone who wants to start
working on parts).

** Linux Kernel Hacker's Guide
   Michael K. Johnson (johnsonm@stolaf.edu) and Dan Miner (dminer@cs.umr.edu)

        This manual covers all of the details of the Linux kernel architecture,
for any UNIX developers who want to be up-to-speed for helping out with the
development of the Linux kernel. For example, if you want to write a device
driver for some type of hardware, this is a great place to start.

        There is an alpha version of this doc available, 16 April 1993.

** Linux Man Pages/Online Documentation
   Rik Faith (faith@cs.unc.edu)

        This project is more widely distributed than the others; there is a
man page directory tree set up on ftp.cs.unc.edu in the directory 
/pub/faith/linux/man.linux. Here are all of the man pages under development 
for sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9. All of the man pages are groff format;
texinfo may be used at a later date but a change over to texinfo has been
dicussed and decided against. Becuase sections 1, 6, etc. are man pages
for individual programs, they're maintained by whoever releases the software.
The directory /pub/faith/linux/man.bsd includes man pages for the BSD
release; they're a good starting point. Basically, if you want to write man
pages, look at what's there and see what's missing, and write away. Then
send any new man pages or modifications to faith@cs.unc.edu. 

        Once enough pages are written, man pages will be released by section.
The ftp.cs.unc.edu FTP space is for man pages under development only. 

** Linux Networking Guide
   Olaf Kirch (okir@mathematik.th-darmstadt.de)

        This guide will suppliment the System Admin's Guide and cover all of 
the diverse issues of networking under Linux, from uucp to serial connections 
to TCP/IP. Many Linux users won't have access to such a network, so this
information is in a seperate manual. It will contain an intro to TCP/IP and
UUCP (for those who have never used such networks before, lots of background
information), TCP/IP, UUCP, and DNS configuration, configuration of mail
systems such as sendmail and Smail, setting up NNTP and news, and NFS.
 
        Much of this guide is already completed, and there should be an
alpha version soon (sometime in April?).

** Other Projects

        There are a number of various projects that are in various stages
of planning and completion. These include:

*** Linux META-FAQ 
    Michael K. Johnson (johnsonm@stolaf.edu)

        The Linux META-FAQ is a short compilation of the various sources of
Linux information. Uploaded to the FTP sites and posted to c.o.l, c.o.l.a, 
news.answers, and comp.answers every few weeks.

*** Linux INFO-SHEET
    Michael K. Johnson (johnsonm@stolaf.edu)

        The Linux INFO-SHEET is another periodic archived posting which gives
a technical introduction to Linux itself, what's going on in the Linux 
community, and how to get started with the operating system. 

*** Glossary and Global Index
  
        A glossary of terms and an index for the entire set of LDP manuals.
I don't remember who's putting this together; please remind me. :) This should
be comprehensive as well as a reference. 

* FTP site for LDP works

        The site for LDP alpha docs (i.e. those that aren't released to the
public yet) is hidden, and for good reason. None of the alpha docs are for
general redistribution. If you're interested in development of LDP docs,
then someone will let you know where the LDP alpha FTP site is. However,
keep in mind that docs there are for development purposes only. 

        Once a particular manual is ready to be released, it will be uploaded
to various places, including:
                sunsite.unc.edu, /pub/Linux/docs
                tsx-11.mit.edu, /pub/linux/doc/doc-project
                nic.funet.fi, /pub/OS/Linux/docs/doc-project
Released versions of man pages will be found there as well.     

* Conventions and Copyright
        
        The set of printed manuals (i.e. everything but the man pages) will
all be formatted under LaTeX. Because these manuals are more comprehensive,
they won't serve well as online documents. Therefore, we all agreed to use
LaTeX to format them--- if an ASCII copy is desired, dvitty can be used.
Also, there is a LaTeX -> texinfo filter being written, which should 
(hopefully) provide texinfo for those who want it. Because we're more
interested in producing nice printed work, not online docs, we decided not
to write in texinfo initially. 

        The printed manuals should use Michael K. Johnson's "linuxdoc.sty"
style sheet and documentation conventions, found in the file "linuxdoc.tar.z"
under the alpha directory. We're trying to achieve a unified look in the 
manuals, both for sake of consistency and portability (in this way, we can 
easily change the look and feel of the manuals by changing linuxdoc.sty), and 
so that all of the authors/editors are on common ground using the same style 
sheet. 

        The LDP license/copyright should be used to copyright all works. 
It's a liberal copyleft like the GPL, but applies to printed documents and 
protects the LDP manuals from publication without our permission. The license
is available with "linuxdoc.tar.z" (see above). There is also a source 
license to be used for the LaTeX source of the LDP documents. 

        The copyright should be under the name of the head coordinator of the 
doc, as an editorial copyright where several people have actually written 
material for the doc. In the case that only 2 or 3 people wrote a given doc, 
the copyright can be in both of their names.

* Slaves (Volunteers)

        Here's a brief list of the folks actively working on the LDP (to the
best of my knowledge). There are over 400 people on the DOC channel, so I 
won't list them all here :), however, if you are actively working on a project
and your name isn't on this list please let me know (this is mostly for my
sake; if something comes up that you may be interested in, I'd like to get
in touch with you). 

        Once an alpha version of a manual is ready, anyone on the LDP is
free to pick it up for proofreading and editing. You can send comments, diffs,
suggestions, etc. to the author of the manual in question. The editing process
is very distributed to let everyone in on the act. Most of the people who have
expressed interest in the LDP have offered help as an editor/proofreader---
now that some of the alpha docs are out, here's your chance. I won't list
all of those proofreading on this list.

Term works very well, I just cant wait for SLAP to get udp :)

But wouldn't it be fortunate if you could get Linux up and running on a
Sun 3/80 (68030) for a price much less than a 386 or 486 PC?

Subject: [Q] Problems compiling Xlife   (Beginner)
Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 07:31:55 GMT

Hi all, Linux has been up and running for over a week now, X is up,
and I hit the first snag: Xlife won't compile.

Details: Standard SLS Linux, with disk series A, B, C and X unpacked.
Standard Xlife-2.0 from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu;
unpacks with no problem. Xmkmf fails, because it can't find /lib/cpp.
Try to create /lib/cpp by making it a softlink to gcc, but then gcc
fails. Presumably linux.cf or site.def would have to be adjusted.
Question: Are these configuration files correct as shipped with SLS,
or should I attempt update them? I don't know the first thing about
Imake, and only little about make. Could it be the the Imake file
shipped with Xlife is wrong? It looks fine (no #'s) to me, no visible
system-dependencies. Is there more to do than say xmkmf (without
parameters) in the correct directory?

Since neither the makefile nor the Imakefile were any help, I just
changed what had to be changed in the source code (one path has to be
fixed in defs.h), compiled all the .c files by hand, simply by
   gcc -c main.c a.c b.c ...
and so on, and linked them with 
   cpp -o Xlife -lX11 -lXext -lm main.o a.o b.o ...
The only problem is that Linux's unistd.h contains a definition of
link (extern int link __P and so on), which conflicts with something
called link in the Xlife source. I fixed that by renaming the object
in Xlife to xllink, which worked.

No problem, the executable is generated, it even starts and creates
the window, but dies with a segmentation fault on the first keystroke
in the Xlife window. In order to make sure that the method is not
horribly flawed, I repeated the exact same manual compile-and-link
procedure under AIX and SunOS, and in both cases it creates a
perfectly functional executable which even works right (which proves
that makefiles are not really necessary). By the way, I have 16MB of
swap space, and xsysinfo shows that there is spare swapspace left, so
I'm not just running out of memory.

Then I thought the problem could be the jump-table libraries, so I
recompiled everything with the -static flag. Now the problem is that
it doesn't link, presumably because one has to use different
libraries, presumably those are libX11.sa and so on. However, gcc
can't find those if one specifies them as -lX11.sa; so I ended up
linking with
   gcc -o Xlife -lm main.o a.o b.o c.o ... /usr/lib/libX11.sa ...
Although this at least doesn't give error messages, the
resulting executable dies immediately with a segmentation fault.  I
could find no recipe in the gcc manpage or in the Linux and SLS FAQ's
for how to correctly compile with static libraries.

No, I don't know how to use gdb (yet), so I didn't try to find out
where the segmentation fault occurs. Nor do I know how to read core
files (and would prefer not having to learn that).

Question: Why does xmkmf fail? Do I have to adjust something first?
How is the c-preprocessor set up for imake? How does one link with
static libraries? Has someonw tried to compile xlife before? Where
should I have looked to find all this information without bothering
the net? And thanks for any help.

I apologize to anyone who may have taken offense to my post: I apparently
spoke without thinking.  I was not pointing my finger at anyone - I was
simply trying to warn, for I have seen posts in the past where people
complianed about newbies asking questions answered in FAQs.  You're right:
I can see how anyone new to the forum would have a bear of a time trying to
find anything.  I leave for a few days and upon returning I find several
hundred new messages, most of which go unread(ah the joys of the catchup
filter :-)  Please forgive me for overstepping my bounds(especially
since I've wasted enough bandwidth posting this).  Newbies SHOULD be
helped as much as possible and not flamed, if for no other reason then
to help spread the idea of a free, powerful OS that everyone can use(not
to mention to garner application support).

        I just downloaded the guide and tutorial for writing Linux dcharacter 
device drivers from sunsite.unc.edu, and it appears that tutorial.doc.z is 
truncated or unfinished (but gunzip doesn't complain or notice that, but I don't 
know if it would complain even if it was truncated after being gzipped. I tried 
another site (wuarchive) but that file was also truncated. Will the person that 
uploaded them *please* re-upload. Thanks. What I have seen so far looks *very* 
useful. Thanks, this should help a lot. (I am thinking of making a /dev/speaker 
that can play audio files on a PC speaker. One problem I have is that I don't 
really know how to get my driver to be run the required 9000 (?) times per 
second though. :P ).

        Wierd.  You might try running mke2fs without the -c

upped the size to 12 megs, and it then worked - but you're

even less of a problem since you're making an 85 meg partition:
mine was 320 megs.  However, I didn't use the -c option(I trust

the swap size.

: /u/openwin/bin  

: for all of the openwin stuff, my install did not put it uner /u, but under /usr
: since I gather that /usr is the right place, how can I fix the X* files to
: look in the right place??
        Modify X's search path to look in the proper directory.  The path
is defined in the file xinitrc, which is located under
        /usr/X386/lib/X11/xinit/   ...or whatever your equivalent usr
directory is.  Edit the xinitrc file, and you'll find a line that sets
the OPENWINHOME directory.  Modify this to read the correct path.  There's
also a path statement in the file; I'd check to see it points to the proper
place.
        Another way you could do it(and perhaps eaisier, if you don't want
to mess around with editing your config files) is to simply set up a 
symbolic link to your openwin directory in the location where xinitrc is
looking: it would simply encounter the link and jump to the proper 
location.

Subject: Serial login success!
Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 04:09:17 GMT


Finally! After a couple of weeks of intermittant puttering I have at last been
able to login to my machine running Linux v0.99 pl4 from a local terminal (a PC
running Procomm v2.0). The relevant lines from the three required configuration
files are shown below:


/etc/inittab:

c7:6:respawn:/bin/getty 19200 ttyS0


/etc/gettydefs:

19200# B19200 CS8 # B19200 SANE -ISTRIP CLOCAL #@S login: #19200


/etc/default/getty.ttyS0:

TIMEOUT=60
WAITFOR=\r

After many requests for help and many responses from the "Linux users world",
up until today, I couldn't get serial logins working. No matter what software
changes I made I couldn't get rid of the "getty respawning too fast" error
message. What I tried today was to disconnect the RS232 cable from the PC
completely. This stopped the "getty respawning too fast" message. Next I
constructed an adapter with pins 2,3 and 7 >>only<< connected through and
inserted that into the RS232 line. That was the answer, now I get a login
prompt and can login from my PC terminal. What I don't understand I why does
this make a difference. My null modem interconnect cable is wired as folows:

1  <----> 1
2  <----> 3
3  <----> 2
4  <----> 5
5  <----> 4
6  <-|--> 8
     |--> 20
8  <--|-> 6
20 <--|

This cable should satisfy all the signal reqirements needed to make a serial
connection. I shouldn't have to isolate all of the handshake lines. As a
matter of fact, in order to establish a connection between both machines
running DOS and Procomm v2.0 on both, I have to remove the isolation adapter
(the handshake lines must me active). Could there be a bug in the software?

Subject: POSIX nonconformance in pathconf(3)
Date: 20 Apr 93 08:20:07 GMT

In writing a manpage for pathconf(3) (nothing like writing documentation
to get to know a system ;-) I've come across behaviour which I think may
be POSIX - nonconforming.

A call to pathconf("/usr/foo/bar", _PC_NAME_MAX) function always returns
255 (which is the value of NAME_MAX from <linux/limits.h>).  According
to POSIX.1, it should return the maximum length of a filename the
process is allowed to create in "/usr/foo/bar".

However, if "/usr/foo/bar" is a directory on a Minix filesystem, the
maximum file lenth is 14; longer filenames are silently truncuated.
(I'm not talking about the DOS filesystem; its inherent limitations
mean that it cannot be POSIX compatible).

An application which relied on pathconf(3) to get the maximum length of
a filename would be in trouble, if it created two filenames which are
longer than 14 characters and only differ from the 15th character on.

Fixes?  I've thought of two, so far.

First, it might just be possible to parse /etc/mtab, to see which kind
of file system "/usr/foo/bar" is mounted on.  Ugly.

Second, add two kernel functions, which return the limits associated
with a particular type of file system (one for fpathconf(), for file
descriptors, and the other for pathconf(), for path names).  This would
require some additions to kernel data structures, such as storing the
maximum length of a filename for a file system somewhere it can be
accessed easily from an inode.

Thoughts, anyone?

Theoretically supposed to be reduced.... not any longer.  That's why everyone
is arguing about RISC v.s. CISC.  Personally, I think CISC will win out.
Just take a look at the Pentium!  (Not that I like Intel architectures either,
but that's another story...)

The ingres available for Linux is based on the last public release before it
went commercial. No SQL (it has its own query language, QUEL) or distributed
databases. I never used the commercial version, so I don't know what other
facilities it provides.

As for speed, if you send me benchmark tests I'll run them and report back.

Subject: [SUMMERY] of Should I use the -m486 flag when recompiling kernel on 386
Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 08:35:15 GMT

Here is the summery of letters that I have received to my question:

When recompiling the kernel on .99pl5, should the -m486
be used for use in a 386 w/ FPU linux box?

Here are the responses that I received from various people.  Thanks for all 
the help guys!  I received excellent, informative responses from linux users.
I thank all who responded to my question, You'all are great.

Neill Means
means@sage.cc.purdue.edu

P.S. When recomiling the kerel, what does profiling support for the kernel do? 
Is it good/bad? Pros/Cons?


[SUMMERY]:
================================
You probably do not want to compile with the -m486 if you want to get the
most performance out of your kernel.  The -m486 flag does some optimizations
for the 486 (FPU or not doesn't matter; optimizations help on a 486sx as well).
These optimizations are due to the instruction timings and pipeline handling
on the 486.  The 386 will still execute these instructions, but with reduced
performance.

I have a 386/40 w/387/40 myself.  I compared the latest X distribution, which
is compiled with -m486, to the previous one, which is not, and there is
a noticeable decrease in performance.  (this is especially visible when
scroling in an xterm)

           |-----------------------------------------------------|

================
Theoretically the 486 is capable of going super-scalar (executing more
than one instruction in a clock cycle) for certain combinations of certain
instructions. These combinations are not neccesarily the obviously fastest 
way of generating code to do something. So, the -m486 switch causes the
compiler to generate code that will run a little faster on a 486 and a little
slower on a 386.

You would probably do a bit better to compile with out the switch if you don't
have a 486.

Not a bad question at all. :)

==================================================
All -m486 does is cause generated code to be placed so as to improve the
performance of the 486's built-in cache.  On a 386 it wastes a *little* memory
with no speedup... but also no slowdown.

I've discovered some problems during the linux installation. FDISK doesn't seem
 to work with the Adaptec 1740 Rev.2 controller, everything I tried resulted in
 the message cannot read /dev/hda. Obviously it seems that it can't read my par

        OK, all BS aside, now.
 
                In this medium I have very few and limited ways to
        communicate with the people I am working with.  There are
        at least 2 other OS groups that want a QIC-40/80 driver.
 
                We plan to work together and share Ideas and more.
        I don't have time for silly pranks like this. If you beleive
        that you may have more _or_ better tools for me to work with,
        I will listen.
 
                You want a QIC-40/80 drive?  Either put up with me,
        or write your own.  I don't care, I don't have time for your
        silly attitudes or mediocre premises.
 
                Thank you for your attention.

No, but the additional mind effort to figure out what the right group

For emacs in its own window, it should grab the keys by itself
(provided you're not doing dirty tricks with xmodmap :-)

For emacs in an xterm window (I guess that's what was mentioned here),
i.e. using emacs -nw or using a version of emacs (such as the SLS B
series) that has no X11 support compiled in,

  copy .../lisp/term/vt100.el to .../lisp/term/xterm.el

since emacs on startup tries to load .../lisp/term/$TERM.el

This is not strictly correct (at least not if the server is running 
Netware 3.11 and thus by implication (I assume) all other Novell boot 
PROMs.): In fact, a DOS image is loaded (any version - depends what 
was used to generate the boot disk file) with some sort of trick that 
causes attempts to access the A: to be rediredted to the server. 

(My evidence for this distinction is simply that if the above weren't
true, RPLODI would be unneccesary - it stops the ODI driver from resetting
the network card (and thus stuffing the server connection) when it is
loaded by AUTOEXEC.BAT. If the whole image were loaded, it wouldn't 
matter and RPLODI would be non-existant.)

To make what you are suggesting work it would be EASIER to write a DOS
boot loader for Linux, place the bootloader (and Linux boot image) in the
server's login directory, then have an AUTOEXEC something like this:

        LSL
        RPLODI
        NE2000
        IPXODI
        NETX
        F:
        LINUX -flinux_boot_image

The other reason for this is tied up with the number of "open" remote
boot sessions that a Netware 3.11 server will support - no more than 3.
I believe that when a remote boot session starts, a special connection
is opened for this purpose. I suspect that the special status of this 
connection is dumped when DOS successfully connects to the server (ie
AFTER NETX loads and runs.) Only 3 connections in this special state may
exist to a given server at any one time.

(My evidence for this last assertion is this: I built a boot image without
RPLODI and then attempted to boot 16 machines from it. 3 started to boot
and locked up when NE2000 loaded, the other 13 reported that no server
could be found. My tests were actually a little more exhaustive than this,
but this is the thrust of it.)

This last constraint leads me to suspect that the approach of connecting
to the server and loading the Linux image from F:\LOGIN may in fact be
the ONLY way to use a Netware server to rboot Linux. 

If anyone constructs a loader and Linux boot image of this type (with luck it
should be possible to load a standard boot image?), I have the 
resources (and will make the time) to test it.

Two final thoughts:

        1. I suspect that even after using NETX to revert the connection
                to its standard state, the workstation will remain
                connected (in Netware's eyes) and perhaps tie up one
                of the licensed users of the server. This will only 
                be an issue if someone wishes to boot a lot of 
                machines of if they are close to their licensed 
                limit. (NB connections are refused by Netware servers
                if you attempt to exceed your licensed limit.)

        2. All of the above is equally relevant for 386bsd, thus 
                the cross-post and changed subject line.

                                 Linux Meta-FAQ 


        This is the Meta-FAQ for Linux.  It is mainly a list of valuable 
        sources of information.  Check these sources out  if you want to 
        learn more  about Linux,  or have  problems and  need help. Lars 
        Wirzenius (wirzeniu@cc.helsinki.fi)  wrote the  first version of 
        this document,  and it is  now maintained by  Michael K. Johnson 
        (johnsonm@stolaf.edu). Mail me  if you have  any questions about 
        this document. 

        NOTE: Filenames in  this article are  for the tsx-11.mit.edu ftp 
        site (see below for names of  more ftp sites). Files are usually 
        located in similar places on other sites. The names are relative 
        to the directory /pub/linux/ on tsx-11. 


        What is Linux? 
           Linux is a clone  of the UNIX operating  system that has been 
           written entirely from scratch. It  has no proprietary code in 
           it.  Linux  is  freely  distributable  under  the  GNU Public 
           License. It only works  on IBM PC compatibles  with an ISA or 
           EISA bus and a 386 or  higher processor. See the FAQ for more 
           exact hardware requirements.  The Linux kernel  is written by 
           Linus  Torvalds  (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)  from Finland. 
           Most of  the programs  running under  Linux are  generic Unix 
           freeware, many of them from the GNU project. 


        The Linux FAQ 
           A collection of common  problems and their solutions. Answers 
           many questions faster than the  net. Stored on many Linux ftp 
           sites   (docs/FAQ/)  and   pit-manager.mit.edu,  the  general 
           archive site for all FAQs. 


        Linux newsgroups 
           There are two Usenet  newsgroups for Linux: comp.os.linux and 
           comp.os.linux.announce. The  latter contains  important stuff 
           like announcements  of new  programs or  versions, the former 
           all the  discussion. It  is a  good idea  to follow  at least 
           c.o.l.a if you use Linux. 


        0.1 Getting Linux 


        0.1.1 Linux FTP sites 

        A  more  complete  list  of Linux  FTP  sites  is  in  the Linux 
        INFO-SHEET  (docs/INFO-SHEET).  The  most  important  sites  are 
        listed here; please see the INFO-SHEET  for a site nearer to you 
        (there are many mirrors). 


           textual name             numeric addr    Linux directory

           nic.funet.fi             128.214.6.100   /pub/OS/Linux

        These sites  are the  main ``home''  sites for  Linux where most 
        uploads take place. There are  many mirror sites; please use the 
        closest (network-wise) site to you. 


        0.1.2 Linux on BBS's 

        Zane Healy posts (around the  beginning and middle of the month) 
        a list of BBS's that have Linux available for download. Try them 
        if you can't FTP. This list is available by ftp as docs/bbs.list 
        at tsx-11. 


        0.1.3 Linux on physical media 

        Linux  is  distributed  on  floppies  by  at  least  Softlanding 
        Software (910 Lodge  Ave, Victoria, B.C,  Canada, V8X-3A8, (604) 
        360-0188)  for  USD  3.25/disk.  This  is  mostly  the  same SLS 
        distribution that is available via FTP (see below). The diskette 
        distribution is  mostly meant for  people who can't  FTP. SLS is 
        also now producing a CD-ROM of the SLS release. 

        Marco      Scheibe   (mykee@cs.tu-berlin.de),    Klaus   Weidner 
        (klaus@snarc.gold.muc.de)            and       Gert      Doering 
        (gert@greenie.gold.muc.de)  will  copy Linux  (the  complete SLS 
        distribution, including  X, possibly  other things  as well) for 
        you, if you send them diskettes and return postage. Contact them 
        via e-mail first. 

        Yggdrasil Computing is producing  a CD-ROM with Linux. Currently 
        a beta version is available (beta referring to the fact that the 
        contents   are  still   evolving)  This  is   a  completely  new 
        distribution, not SLS. A complete  listing of files is available 
        via FTP from netcom.com in directory ftp/pub/yggdrasil. There is 
        also    a   manual   and   other   information   there.  Contact 
        yggdrasil@netcom.com    or   call   (510)526-7531,   9am-5:30pm, 
        California time. 

        Also  check  advertisements/* at  tsx-11  for  advertisements of 
        other ways to  get linux, including  a list of  people that will 
        make copies for you at low prices. 

        If you know of other distributors, send me a note! 


        0.1.4 Commercial networks 

        GEnie  mirrors  most  of  tsx-11  and  sunsite  (including SLS). 
        CompuServe has only very limited very old Linux archives. 


        0.1.5 Mailservers and such 

        The        trickle    server     TRICKLE@AWIWUW11.BITNET,    aka 
        TRICKLE@AWIWUW11.EARN, aka  TRICKLE@AWIWUW11.wu-wien.ac.at, send 
        mail to one of these addresses with a body consisting of /HELP. 


        0.2 Linux distributions (aka ``releases'') 


        Linux  is distributed  by  its author  only  as a  kernel. Other 
        people  have put  together ``distributions''  that can  be used. 
        These distributions  pair the kernel  as released  by the author 
        with software, to make a complete working package. Most releases 
        include   application  programs  as  well  as  system  software, 
        providing ``one stop shopping'' for Linux. 

        Jim Winstead and H.J. Lu maintain the boot and root disks. These 
        two  form more  or less  the ``official''  release. It  is fully 
        functional, but only has the bare essentials. The filenames are: 
        images/bootimage-xxx.Z  and  images/rootimage-xxx.Z  (xxx stands 
        for  the  version  number). They're  also  hard  to  install for 
        newcomers; I'd go for  the SLS release (below)  if you're new to 
        Linux and want all of the goodies. 

        The SLS  (Softlanding Linux  System) release  is rather complete 
        and has more or less all of the software you could possibly want 
        for any Linux system.  This release is what  all new Linux users 
        should install: it's easy to do  and since most people have used 
        the SLS Linux  distribution, if you have  any problems there are 
        many people out there who can  give you help. The SLS release is 
        updated periodically,  with ``full'' updates  taking place every 
        few      weeks.   You    can   find    the   SLS    release   on 
        tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/SLS/. 

        H.J.  Lu (the  Linux  GCC maintainer)  also  has another  set of 
        disks,   including  a  combined  boot  and  rootdisk,  and  some 
        additional disks  with more  programs. This  package assumes you 
        are already familiar with Linux, and  at least some of it may be 
        incorporated  to  the  work  of  Jim  Winstead.  See directories 
        GCC/rootdisk and GCC/basedisk on tsx-11. 


        0.3 Linux mailing-lists 


        Used mostly  for discussion  between developers  of new features 
        and testers of pre-release versions. See addresses in the FAQ. 


        0.4 Linux News --- summaries of annoucements 


        A  weekly summary  of announcements  of  new programs  and other 
        interesting    news.   Edited   by   Denise   Tree,   posted  to 
        comp.os.linux.announce, comp.os.linux and  the LINUXNEWS channel 
        on the  linux-activists mailing  list (see  the FAQ  for info on 
        joining mailing lists). It is also available via GEnie. Intended 
        for people  who don't  have time or  energy to  sift through the 
        high volume of comp.os.linux. 


        0.5 Other newsgroups are useful, too 


        At              least       the        groups       comp.unix.{ 
        questions,shell,programming,bsd,admin},                    and 
        comp.windows.x.i386unix should  be useful  for a  Linux user. If 
        you have a problem that is not directly Linux-related, ask it in 
        these groups, not in c.o.l (which  is too big for some people as 
        it is). 


        0.6 Documentation for various programs 


        Many programs come  with some sort of  documentation, often in a 
        file called README or something similar.  It is a VERY good idea 
        to  read  them with  care.  It  is boring  to  see  (and answer) 
        questions that are answered in the documentation. 


        0.7 Keeping track of current releases 


        New  releases,  programs,  and ports  are  usually  announced in 
        comp.os.linux.  finger torvalds@klaava.helsinki.fi  to  get some 
        information about the current kernel (often long!). See also the 
        next item. 


        0.8 The Linux Project Registry 


        Maintained by James  Callison, a list of  ``who is doing what''. 
        See the list  itself for mail addresses.  Posted every two weeks 
        to comp.os.linux. Contains information  about the current status 
        for included projects. 


        0.9 The Linux Hardware Compatibility List 


        Posted occasionally to comp.os.linux.announce,  and found on the 
        major Linux FTP sites.  This list lists some  of the devices and 
        hardware that Linux  currently supports. It's  useful for anyone 
        wanting to  purchase or upgrade  their system. Be  aware that it 
        cannot be  complete, as  there is  more hardware  out there than 
        Linux users can own.

Date: Tue, 20 Apr 1993 07:23:05 GMT


        I have a Syquest drive on my Adaptec 1542, and have formatted 
a cartridge for mounting under linux to hold source code. When linux
boots, if there's no cartidge in the drive, linux will not recognise
a cartridge when it's inserted. Under Adaptec's dos driver, this is not
the case. Is there any way the scsi driver could be changed to recognise
that the Syquest could have a cartridge inserted in it at a later date,
and would anyone be interested in coding it, as it's beyond my programming
skills at the moment.

Subject: [Q]:Alarm Clock and Animation
Date: 19 Apr 93 19:09:44 GMT

Greetings.  I am having a problem with any animation-viewing programs on my 
Linuxbox.  xviewgl, xdl, and xflick all abort(at different stages) and give 
'Alarm Clock' as their only output.
xviewgl loads up a screen, then when it's time to play the animation, it 
then aborts.  xdl gets to the point where it sets up the bitmaps, says it
is done, then pukes out.
xflick works, as long as it is run in verbose mode(then for a finite number
of cycles), then exits with the same error.
I am using 4.3.3, and 3.0 of the Xlibs, Xfree86 1.2, GCC 2.3.3, 99pl7A, and 
olvwm.
A possible(and considered) problem is the size of my system.  I'm running a
386sx/20, with 4 meg core(7 Swap) and 85 MB HD.  This may seem particularly
constrictive for X, but I've stripped everything down(4 Meg total FREE) and
run them from xvt.  Still, they hate me.
Is this just a memory problem?  It doesn't swap very much, so I wouldn't 
think that I am using all my vmem, but anything is possible.

You don't have to go commercial in order to make sure that commercial
developers don't try to make money from your work without doing any work
themselves.

>          We tell people "You can do whatever you want with this, 
>except claim you wrote it.  And we'd appreciate it if you gave us credit

Yeah, you'd "appreciate it". Here's an extremely hyptohetical case to
make a point:

Let's say Microsoft decides they don't want to put in the development
costs for Windows NT, so they ftp 386BSD and XFree and plaster
"Microsoft" logos all over it. Let's say it's tremendously sucessful and
MS gets away with charging $500 per copy and Bill Gates makes another $7
billion.

Are you telling me you wouldn't have even a hint of sentiment that
somebody had grossly freeloaded off you?

See what I'm getting at here? There's no way you can be sure that the
general computing community (aka "Joe User") will benefit at all from
the selfless, thankless work you've done. You don't think that the lower
development costs of the commercial packages are going to actually lower
the final price of the package, do you? The price of the software is
designed to do ONE thing only: maximize "price*quantity_sold", and the
fact that you ended up doing a lot of their work for free isn't going to
affect that at all. That's not how economics works.

On the other hand, let's suppose some company took XFree and spruced it
up a tad and added some functionality that you really liked. You liked
it better than the XFree you were using and you didn't want to go
through the trouble of coding those same changes in yourself, so you
asked for a copy from them.... and they say "Sure. That'll be $200
please.". What's to keep someone from changing one line of your code and
then charging you X amount of money in exchange for a copy of it.

Hell, I'd think the LEAST you'd do is stipulate that, if anyone uses
your code, they have to put a message somewhere conspicuous that the
software is heavily derived from a package you can get for FREE from
so-and-so. Otherwise, there's no reason to believe you've done anything
other than increase some company's profits. You haven't lowered the cost
to "Joe User" one bit!

> Why hang some rediculous requirements like the GPL
>on it, when we have no intention/desire/resources to enforce it?

Because a corporation won't put their balls on the chopping block like
that. Even if they thought you wouldn't care, the day may someday come
when you DID care (perhaps when THEIR derivative or your software was
very sucessful and you were having trouble making your house-payments).
Unless they have a license to do what they want, no careful company is
going to expose themself to litgation like that.

Well, I just perused the GPL and I think it quite up-front about its
intent. The GPL is intended to make sure that OTHER people can't put
more restrictions on your software. In order to do that, there is a
certain amout of necessary restriction that they must place on the
software in order to ensure that even more restriction. I mean, compared
to the restrictions that COULD be placed on the software, the GPL is
extremely lax. In fact, when I think about it, it seems that the GPL
doesn't restrict what you can DO with the software as far as
modification; it just restricts how mean you can be to the people you
pass the software on to. The GPL stipulates that you have to extend
every courtesy that was extended to you. Fair's fair.

Also, I think the GPL is designed to sort of stack the deck against
commercial software. Since commercial development tools can be used to
develop commercial OR GNU-ish software, GNU-ish tools can only be used
to develop more GNU-ish tools. It's like a one-way door. I like it. ;-}

Yeah. Wait until the tables are turned after they get big. Wait until
YOU need a favor from THEM, when their company is being run by lawyers
and bean-counters.... see if they even remember your NAME!

               ^^^^^^^^^^^

Okay. I've just decided that I'm going to develop an object oriented
desktop from Windows to compete with Norton Desktop. I'll just search
around for a bunch of folks like you who are looking for a learning
experience. THen, I'll sit around and wait until you guys finish it.
Then, I'll package it and sell it for $100 a copy. Oh... I'll be REALLY
cooperative. Hell, I might even buy you lunch for letting me freeload
off of you.


>The GPL doesn't protect anyone unless they have the resources to try to
>enforce it.

But no software company is going to bet on that. If the company becomes
sucessful at all based upon the merits of your software, SOME lawyer is
going to offer to sue on your behalf just for a cut of the award.

Well, I think of it as akin to our rights as American citizens: There is
a certain set of restrictions that must be placed upon my freedom to
ensure that I can't restrict OTHERS' freedoms. For example, I am
prohibited from shooting you in the head, because that would infringe
upon your right NOT to be shot in the head.

On the same token, the GPL places just enough restriction to ensure that
nobody can place any MORE restrictions. It ensures that each recipient
of GNUish software will pass on the same privledges and rights that were
afforded to THEM. Isn't that fair?

You have to impose SOME set of rule to ensure fairness.... just like
there must be SOME set of laws to ensure freedom.

   I think that GNU/LPF/FSF need to examine the GPL and see if they can
   make their tools usable by EVERYONE!  Why are we wasting countless
   hours having DEC/HP/Novell/Sun/etc write their own architecture specific
   compilers, lib's, and windowing wigits.  I'm sure many companies would
   use GCC, etc. if the GPL wasn't so viral.

They might, and they might not supply their changes.  The GPL is about
user-empowerment (if there's a problem, you can fix it yourself, or
get help from a variety of places) and sharing (each GNU developer can
build on the work of others -- no need for reinventing the wheel.

In fact many companies _do_ base their software strategies on GNU
software.  Naturally, our customers are among them!

   I personally am looking forward to the day that I can write a piece of
   code and have it run on every machine I have an account on... with no
   changes.  Is GNU interested in this kind of thing also?

Of course.  Though only part of the problem is addressed by the GNU
project.  For instance, if you do't have enough disk space, they won't
help... 

This has only a little to do with Linux, sorry.  But the GPL is hardly
a _barrier_ to the Linux's development -- it's a technical advantage,
just like any other.

Just hold Ctrl-Key down while booting (With my and the most other BIOS after

Then you get a line "LILO boot:" instead of "LILO booting ...". Then you

This is a very FAQ these days - could it be that the SLS distribution has a
bug?

Try one of these

su
cd /etc
ln -s inet/* .

...or...

su
cd /etc
mv inet/* .
rmdir inet
ln -s . inet

This was required by the relase notes on libc (version 4.3+ I think).

Subject: Debugging possible hardware problems
Date: 20 Apr 1993 12:55:49 GMT


I'm running Linux on an 80486 EISA system, and I'm having what I think are
hardware problems.  It could be software, but I don't see why I'd be the
only one having trouble.  I'd like some advice on how best to debug this.

The symptom: when I try to build gcc, I get unpredictable and unrepeatable
results.  Sometimes a .o file is not in valid a.out format.  Recompiling the
file gives me a valid binary.  Sometimes the compiler aborts or dumps core,
but works fine when run again with the same input.  Compiling the same
source files with the same arguments gives slight differences in a few
object files.  (Note that Linux, unlike many other systems, does not put
timestamps in object files so compiling twice should give bit-identical
results.)

I also have occasional filesystem corruption on my SCSI drive, but that
could be caused by using development software.  It could also be related to
my problems compiling.  The compile problems are not caused by disk
problems: I get the same results whether I do my work on an IDE or SCSI
disk.

I've set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommended values.

I suspect the external cache, but I have no real evidence for this.

The motherboard is a NICE Super-EISA with 256 KB write-back cache and a DX/2
66 Mhz processor.

What I'm looking for:

        . A system test program to run under DOS or Linux

        . Suggestions about the cause of the problem

        . Suggestions about how to debug the problem

 The new process doesn't really know for sure that the lock is invalid.
Kermit is nice and will at least tell you how to rm the lock if
it is owned by you. But the lock could be owned by any other process
and actually be valid so you don't want to automatically rm it.
Otherwise you defeat the purpose of the lock in the first place.

This is possibly a very very stupid question, but here goes..

Is it possible to use on of those Jumbo/Colorado cheap tape streamers
that attach to the IDE disk controller card (i.e no SCSI) from Linux,
also would the format be compatible i.e readable from a UNIX workstation
for instance a SUN4, a SCO box, or whatever? I imagine someone would have
to write a possibly fairly hideous device driver to do so, but maybe this
has been done?
No flames please if this a truly dumb thing to ask, I only got my PC a few
days ago, I've only just installed Linux and haven't had time to read all the
dox yet.
No I don't have a tape streamer, by the way, and if I can't do this I am
not going to.

If this can't be done is there any other cheap storage method other than
floppies?

fs.h gives the wrong prototype for the ioctl call -- the last argument should
be an unsigned long as in sys_ioctl() and file_ioctl() in fs/fs.c.  However,
since sizeof(unsigned int) == sizeof(unsigned long), the error does not
matter.

Date: 20 Apr 1993 13:23:35 GMT

My linux is runing on a 486DX33 (eisa board) with an AT-BUS 170M harddisk.
I am using  ext2fs-0.2e.
I tested the disk speed under dos with the result of 880000 bytes/sec.
Under linux I have used iozone to test the disk-speed with the results
        write:  550000 bytes/sec.
        read:   350000 bytes/sec.

My question: Why is the read access slower than the write, or ist the 
file system benchmark "iozone" wrong? [nornaly most disk access are read accesss]
[Compiling xview-programs which have to read about 3M bytes includes need faster
read access than write access. ]
Exist a way to speedup the file system or the block device access ?


PS: the xiafs file system is slower.
        write: 350000 bytes/sec.
        read:  250000 bytes/sec.

I'm experiencing what looks like an NFS problem to me. Every now and
then jobs started by cron on one of my machine cannot be executed,
because tha command can't be found (they're on an NFS-mounted drive).
Same crond and same commands on the machine where the command resides
execute w/o trouble. 

This appears mostly (but not always) when two commands are started
more or less at the same time, e.g. "/usr/lib/atrun" and
"/usr/bin/sendmail -q". I even once had a segmentation fault from
atrun (this command is executed every minute, so it seems to work fine
if there's one core dump in a week since I installed 0.99-p8). AND I
never had these problems with the prior kernel releases.

Is there some sort of problem with tsx-11.mit.edu?  I have been
trying to get on there for the last 2 days at various times of

Is there a problem, or has linux experienced a sudden surge in
popularity?  Or both? :)

The reason I ask is that I'm finally going to take the plunge
and get rid of Coherent in favor of linux so I wanted to get
the latest SLS release.

Best regards,

ok  just two questions:

1) Im running getty on a serial port (not to a modem to) on a null modem link
to  another terminal.  The serial line doesnt have wires for cts/rts or CD etc
so I have them hard wired in the plyg on the back of my computer.  It works
fine until the person logged on to that port logs out then I get the
"respawning too fast message" and getty never actually respawns... 
Anybody got logins from serial ports working propely want to perhaps give me a
clue as to what is going wrong?

2) I found a term-ised version of telnet on sunsite a while ago but its line
mode is slightly screwed up (the output doesnt get echoed until a newline is
pressed) - is there a later version of this around somewhere that doesnt
display this problem?

Anyhow - any emails of suggestions etc would be muchly appreciated!

        Thanks, Simon.

MGR is fun to tinker with.  It's simple enough that an individual can
realistically expect to comprehend most of it without spending a lifetime
at it.  MGR doesn't need networking more complicated than an asynchronous
modem connection in order to run remote applications.  The MGR distribution
is approximately an order of magnitude smaller than X, so the average
hacker can compile it from source without having to take out a second
mortgage to buy more disk.  MGR is sort of like a blank canvas on which
you may create something.  MGR needs some help when it comes to support
for resolutions over 640x480 on modern SVGA cards.  I had MGR working at
800x600 on my old no-name Trident 8800-based card, but I haven't been able
to do better than 640x480 on my new ATI Graphics Ultra Pro.

On the other hand, X has gazillions of applications, oodles of window managers,
hordes of enthusiastic developers, and all sorts of complicated gizmos to
get working.  If you want to actually use your system to do work, you'll
probably be happier with X.  It's harder to get going initially, but it supports
more SVGA cards and has a lot more application support than MGR.  I like
MGR, and I still mess with it from time to time.  I would like to run X
software, however, so I've recently invested in a big 486 that can do it
justice.

(Note that is a NEW MACHINE, the Dell 320SLi is now obsolete and unavailable.)

Random info, in no particular order:

o The machine weighs only 3.6lbs with the battery, so it is VERY portable. 

o 2-10M RAM, I have 10M.  I compiled the kernel with gcc while running X and
did not have swapping enabled (ie: it wasn't necessary).

o 80M, 120M, or 200M disks available. 

o One PCMCIA slot, which I plan to fill with an ethernet card; I assume but am
not sure I can find one that is compatible with a card Linux already supports.

o 10M ram, 200M disk configuration cost me $2,391.20 bottom line (including
shipping and tax).

I have no financial interest in Dell (or Linux, for that matter :-).
