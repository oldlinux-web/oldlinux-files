<H1>A20 - a pain from the past</H1>Everybody hates the CapsLock key, but 
keyboard manufacturers continue producing keyboards with CapsLock - it could be 
that someone wants it. 
<P>With A20 it is similar but worse. Really nobody wants it, but it continues to 
haunt us. 
<P>
<H2>History</H2>The 8088 in the original PC had only 20 address lines, good for 
1 MB. The maximum address FFFF:FFFF addresses 0x10ffef, and this would silently 
wrap to 0x0ffef. When the 286 (with 24 address lines) was introduced, it had a 
real mode that was intended to be 100% compatible with the 8088. However, it 
failed to do this address truncation (a bug), and people found that there 
existed programs that actually depended on this truncation. Trying to achieve 
perfect compatibility, IBM invented a switch to enable/disable the 0x100000 
address bit. Since the 8042 keyboard controller happened to have a spare pin, 
that was used to control the AND gate that disables this address bit. The signal 
is called A20, and if it is zero, bit 20 of all addresses is cleared. 
<H2>Present</H2>Why do we have to worry about this nonsense? Because by default 
the A20 address line is disabled at boot time, so the operating system has to 
find out how to enable it, and that may be nontrivial since the details depend 
on the chipset used. 
<H2>Classical A20 control, via the keyboard controller</H2>The output port of 
the keyboard controller has a number of functions. <BR>Bit 0 is used to reset 
the CPU (go to real mode) - a reset happens when bit 0 is 0. <BR>Bit 1 is used 
to control A20 - it is enabled when bit 1 is 1, disabled when bit 1 is 0. 
<BR>One sets the output port of the keyboard controller by first writing 0xd1 to 
port 0x64, and the the desired value of the output port to port 0x60. One 
usually sees the values 0xdd and 0xdf used to disable/enable A20. Thus: <PRE>        call    empty_8042
        mov     al,#0xd1                ! command write
        out     #0x64,al
        call    empty_8042
        mov     al,#0xdf                ! A20 on
        out     #0x60,al
        call    empty_8042
</PRE>where <TT>empty_8042</TT> has to wait for the kbd to finish handling 
input, say <PRE>empty_8042:
        call    delay
        in      al,#0x64
        test    al,#2
        jnz     empty_8042
        ret
</PRE>
<H3>Variation</H3>The HP Vectra accepts a shortcut, where writing 0xdd or 0xdf 
to port 0x64 will disable/enable A20. <PRE>! For the HP Vectra
        call    empty_8042
        jnz     err
        mov     al,#0xdf
        out     #0x64,al
        call    empty_8042
        jnz     err
        mov     al,#0xdf        ! Do it again
        out     #0x64,al
        call    empty_8042
        jnz     err
! Success
</PRE>(HIMEM.SYS in DOS 5.0 incorrectly identifies some computers as HP Vectra - 
this may cause a hang at boot. Fixed in DOS5.0a.) 
<H2>A20 control via System Control Port A</H2>Some operating systems use the 
switching off and on of A20 as part of the standard procedure to switch between 
real (16-bit) and protected mode. Since the keyboard microcontroller is slow, it 
was desirable to avoid it, and a Fast Gate A20 Option was introduced, where I/O 
port 0x92 (System Control Port A) is used to handle A20, circumventing the 
keyboard controller. 
<P>Thus, MCA, EISA and other systems can also control A20 via port 0x92. This 
port has a number of functions, and the details depend on the manufacturer. Bits 
0,1,3,6,7 seem to have the same meaning everywhere this port is implemented. 
<BR>Bit 0 (w): writing 1 to this bit causes a fast reset (used to switch back to 
real mode; for MCA this took 13.4 ms). <BR>Bit 1 (rw): 0: disable A20, 1: enable 
A20. <BR>Bit 3 (rw?): 0/1: power-on password bytes (stored in CMOS bytes 
0x38-0x3f or 0x36-0x3f) accessible/inaccessible. This bit can be written to only 
when it is 0. <BR>Bits 6-7 (rw): 00: hard disk activity LED off, 01,10,11: hard 
disk activity LED on. <BR>Bits 2,4,5 are unused or have varying meanings. (On 
MCA bit 4 (r): 1: watchdog timeout occurred.) 
<P>
<H3>Using 0x92 may be necessary</H3>Sometimes (especially on embedded systems) 
no keyboard controller is present, and it may be necessary to use 0x92. Often 
however, the chip will catch accesses to ports 0x64 and 0x60 and simulate the 
expected behaviour, also when no keyboard controller is present. Sometimes, this 
snooping behaviour must be enabled first. 
<H3>Using 0x92 may be dangerous</H3>Gianluca Anzolin 
<G.ANZOLIN@INWIND.IT>reports: I have an Olivetti M4 (P166) with TRIDENT 9660 
video card integrated on the mainboard. Linux boots well, but after LILO has 
loaded the kernel, the screen becomes black and remains black ever after. 
Removing <PRE>        inb     $0x92, %al                      #
        orb     $02, %al                        # "fast A20" version
        outb    %al, $0x92                      # some chips have only this
</PRE>from <TT>setup.S</TT> solved this. Apparently on his machine writing to 
some of these bits is dangerous and does something to the on-board video card 
(disable it? lspci shows it only when 0x92 is not touched). Similar things are 
reported by others: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I am trying to install Linux on an old Olivetti pc M4 Modulo 
  P75 but I am quickly stopped. I always got the same display problem very soon 
  during the installation.The display is not updated anymore. The embedded 
  display adapter is a "Trident 9xxx PCI".</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>and 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I have a strange problem with an old Olivetti M4 (pentium 75) 
  machine. I buy for a very cheap price 5 of these, but when I boot the machine 
  the screen goes blank. The (embedded on MoBo) video chip is a Trident 
  TGUI9780.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Petr Vandrovec <VANDROVE@VC.CVUT.CZ>suggests to do the write only when it is 
really necessary: <PRE>        inb     $0x92, %al                      #
+       testb   $02, %al
+       jnz     no92
        orb     $02, %al                        # "fast A20" version
        outb    %al, $0x92                      # some chips have only this
+no92:
</PRE>Since bit 0 sometimes is write-only, and writing a one there causes a 
reset, it must be a good idea to add the line <PRE>        andb    $0xfe, %al
</PRE>before the <TT>outb</TT>. 
<H3>Using only 0x92 may be dangerous</H3>Kai Germaschewski reports that he gets 
a spontaneous kernel reboot (on a Sony PCG-Z600NE) after suspend/resume when A20 
was enabled using 0x92 but not via the keyboard controller. Apparently state set 
via keyboard controller is correctly saved and restored, but state set via 0x92 
is not. 
<H3>Port 0x92 may have to be enabled</H3>Various SMSC super I/O chips will 
emulate the keyboard controller, but emulate port 0x92 only when that has been 
enabled. 
<H3>CMOS indicating the presence of a Fast A20 Gate</H3>Depending on the BIOS, 
the possibility of using a fast A20 switch may be visible in the CMOS. For 
example, some AMI BIOSes have in CMOS location 0x2d a byte with contents <PRE>     System Operational Flags
     Bit 7 = 1: Weitek math coprocessor present
     Bit 6 = 1: Floppy drive seek at boot disabled
     Bit 5 = 1: System boot sequence A:,C: (otherwise C:,A:)
     Bit 4 = 1: System boot CPU speed high
     Bit 3 = 1: External cache enabled
     Bit 2 = 1: Internal cache enabled
     Bit 1 = 1: Fast gate A20 operation enabled
     Bit 0 = 1: Turbo switch function enabled
</PRE>Of course, this does not help at all. 
<H3>FreeBSD</H3>FreeBSD does <PRE>/*

</PRE>that is, uses 0x92 only for a IBM_L40 (whatever that may be). The FreeBSD 
handbook describes PC98 as "an alternative development branch of PC hardware, 
popular in Japan" and "the NEC PC98 platform".

<H3>Minix and HIMEM.ASM</H3><A 
href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/xfix-286mode2">Here</A> is a patch 
fragment for minix. It contains the interesting part <PRE>!       movb    al, #0xff       ! Pulse output port
!       outb    0x64
!       call    kb_wait         ! Wait for the A20 line to settle down
</PRE>from some old HIMEM.ASM source (that one still can find on the net). I 
have seen no other places where command 0xff is described as doing something 
useful. 
<H2>Access of 0xee</H2>On some systems reading ioport 0xee enables A20, and 
writing it disables A20. (Or, sometimes, this action only occurs when ioport 
0xee is enabled.) And similar things hold for ioport 0xef and reset (a write 
causes a reset). 
<P>The i386SL/i486SL documents say <PRE>The following ports are visible only when enabled,
Any writes to these ports cause the action named.
Name of Register     Address   Default Value  Where placed    Size

say: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Register EEh can be used to cause the same type of masking of 
  the CPU A20 signal that was historically performed by an external SCP (System 
  Control Processor) in a PC/AT Compatible system, but much faster. This control 
  defaults to not forcing the propagation of A20: Dummy Read = Returns FFh, and 
  forces the A20 signal to propagate. Dummy Write = Deasserts the forcing of the 
  propagation of the A20 signal via this particular control, data value written 
  is N/A. For software compatibility and other reasons, there are several 
  sources of GateA20 control. These controls are effectively ORed together with 
  the output of the OR gate driving the Enhanced Am486 microprocessor A20M pin. 
  Therefore, A20 will propagate if ANY of the independent sources are forcing 
  A20 to propagate.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>Other ports</H2>It is rumoured that systems exist that use bit 2 of ioport 
0x65 or bit 0 of ioport 0x1f8 for A20 control (0: disabled, 1: enabled). Don't 
know what systems that might be. The AT&amp;T 6300+ needs a write of 0x90 to 
port 0x3f20 to enable (and a write of 0x0 to disable) A20. 
<H2>Disabling A20</H2>It may be necessary to do both the keyboard controller 
write and the 0x92 write (and the 0xee write) to disable A20. 
<H2>A20 and reset</H2>If (in protected mode) A20 is disabled, the odd megabytes 
are inaccessible. After a reset, execution begins at top-of-memory: 0xfffff0 on 
the 286 and 0xfffffff0 on 386 and later. With disabled A20 this becomes 0xeffff0 
or 0xffeffff0 and the machine will probably crash, having no memory mapped 
there. 
<H2>A20 and cache</H2>One tests A20 by writing something to an address with bit 
0x100000 set, and seeing whether the corresponding location in low memory 
changes. However, this plan may be thwarted by the cache that remembers the old 
value and doesn't know about A20. 
<P><A 
href="http://qdn.qnx.com/support/docs/neutrino_qrp/building/startup.html">Neutrino</A> 
describes the following function <TT>x86_enable_a20()</TT>: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Enable address line A20, which is often disabled on many PCs on 
  reset. It first checks if address line A20 is enabled and if so returns 0. 
  Otherwise, it sets bit 0x02 in port 0x92, which is used by many systems as a 
  fast A20 enable. It again checks to see if A20 is enabled and if so returns 0. 
  Otherwise, it uses the keyboard microcontroller to enable A20 as defined by 
  the old PC/AT standard. It again checks to see if A20 is enabled and if so 
  returns 0. Otherwise, it returns -1. If cpu is a 486 or greater, it issues a 
  <TT>wbinvd</TT> opcode to invalidate the cache when doing a read/write test of 
  memory to see if A20 is enabled. In the rare case where setting bit 0x02 in 
  port 0x92 may affect other hardware, you can skip this by setting 
  <TT>only_keyboard</TT> to 1. In this case, it will attempt to use only the 
  keyboard microcontroller.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>hpa comments: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>As far as I know the only machines which have the cache problem 
  are i386 boxen, but the i386 doesn't have WBINVD. The i486 has a pin on the 
  CPU for A20, which takes effect inside the L1 cache, and so it shouldn't have 
  any A20 cache issues.</I> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Jens Maurer <A 
href="http://www.cck.uni-kl.de/misc/tecra710/linux-problem">reported</A> in 1996 
on boot problems with a bzImage kernel: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>On the Toshiba laptop, the first two bytes at 0x100000 are 
  incorrect and identical to those from address 0x000000 (which was an alias for 
  0x100000 before the A20 gate enable). At a second read from 0x100000 
  immediately afterwards, the correct memory content is returned. Asus P55TP5XE 
  boards (Triton I chipset) show quite the same problem, but there, only the 
  first byte is incorrect and booting bzImage kernels works fine. To me, this 
  looks like some buffer or cache coherency problem although I think that caches 
  are organized in at least 16 byte cache lines. ... This exact same problem 
  reportedly also exists on Fujitsu 555T (report from Andrea Caltroni) laptop 
  and Compudyne Pentium 60 (report from David Kerr) desktop computers.</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>He gives a patch, and adds "<I>Unfortunately, Philip Hands reports 
that the above patch makes some people with other non-laptop computers unable to 
boot.</I>" 
<P>Using zImage instead of bzImage avoids the problem (since zImage is not 
loaded high). Debian has distributed special Tecra boot floppies for a while. 
Later it was found out that these laptops just have an incredibly slow keyboard 
controller and that all is fine with a larger timeout. 
<H2>BIOS</H2>If it is difficult, maybe impossible, to write a routine that will 
enable A20 on all PCs, one might ask the BIOS to do so. Many recent BIOS 
versions implement INT15 AX=240x functions, as follows: <PRE>INT 15 AX=2400 disable A20
INT 15 AX=2401 enable A20
INT 15 AX=2402 query status A20
INT 15 AX=2403 query A20 support (kbd or port 92)

Return:
  If successful: CF clear, AH = 00h
  On error: CF set, AH = status
  Status: 01h keyboard controller is in secure mode
          86h function not supported
  For AX=2402 the status (0: disabled, 1: enabled) is returned in AL
  For AX=2403 the status (bit 0: kbd, bit 1: port 92) is returned in BX
