I also experienced something like this from a terminal connected to a serial
port.  The user disconnected without logging out.  She was running Kermit on
the Linux machine and simply disconnected.  We noticed this problem the next
day when she could no longer connect through the serial port.  I checked and
sure enough, her process was still there.  I killed it and she was able to
connect again.  This is with Kernel 1.1.24.

Subject: Setting up INN on a Linux box!
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 1994 22:20:39 GMT

     Hi, I am trying to set up INN on my linux box. I am having major 
problems, when I try to connect to my nntp port by typeing telnet 
novanet.com 119 I get 502 novanet NNTP server can't talk to you. Why is 
this I have locahost: and novanet.com: in hosts.nntp. This is my messages 
and syslog files form my system. Hop you can get something out if it an 
inform me what I am doing wrong.

This is the /usr/adm/messages file:

    Ok, I think part of the problem is that I put /et/rc.d/rc.news in my 
rc.local file and it load inetd, but inetd is loaded in rc.inet2. If I 
take out the inetd daemon in rc.inet2 I cant telnet to my box for any 
host. How should i fix this problem. 
    If someone is runing INN could they tar the /usr/lib/news directory 
and any other config file and ftp it to me? Or if you can help me in any 
way please send me some e-mail.

You can ftp the files to me at:

novanet.com in the /incoming directory 

or

ftp.netom.com in the /pub/nstn directory

You can email me at nstn@netcom.com or nathan@novanet.com

Thanks, for your help.

I've got an 8 meg box and X _apps_ run fine off CD if the server's on the HDD.
And 16 meg swap. Wouldn't like to try running X itself off the CD tho'.  I do
get a bit of swapping, but bearable.

Doesn't seem to me like your portmapper is running. Is it ?? Does rpc.portmap
appear in your process table ? What does

        rpcinfo -p 

say ??

Then again you cant run Sun automount on DEC's/NeXT/HP etc.. It is not available
in source code. You can however run AMD on most machines and thus it is much
more useful that Suns automounter.

I would suggest you get the maps auto.home and auto.master and use the perl
script included in the AMD sources to convert them to AMD syntax. You can
then mount your Sun machines (i havent tried though as we use AMD on our
Suns too).

How exactly is ugidd used? The man pages don't seem to say much.
The impression I get of ugidd is that you can map userid numbers from
one machine to another when you mount partitions.  

Normally, if I'm user 511 on someone else's computer, and someone else
is 511 on my machine, and I mount a directory from the other computer
that has permissions set for 511, I can't access it.

Ugidd can handle this right?

Thanks for the info.

And sources for more similar administration stuff like this would be
appreciated :)

Make runlevel 6 the default instead of 5 (in /etc/inittab).  rc.6

The short answer is "Set up your network properly" as you have not provided
much information for people to be able to disassemble your problem into
something coherent. For example

        What sort of network ? Slip/PPP/ethernet
        What network card do you have - is it recogonized on boot
        Can you get outgoing connctions to work 
        Is your routing tables correct?

That is a DOS emulator. It won't run SCO Unix programs :-).

        In my post about Linux smail, I posted that having debug mode
enabled would allow someone to execute remote commands on your
machine.  This statement is, in fact, wrong.  If debug is enabled,
someone *can* set the debug level of smail remotely.  If the debug
mode is set high enough, a cracker can crash your computer by filling
up your hard drive.  Linux machines are especially vulnerable to this,
because they tend to have smaller HDs.

        Note that the version of smail that comes with Slackware was
compiled in such a way that it is impossible to trun debuging on.
(You can't even use a command-line switch, as near as I can tell.)  I
had to recompile from scratch to get debug to work.  While I was at
it, I used -O2 and -m486 to make smail a tad faster.

Subject: eth0: Inf. loop in interrupt, sometimes, with a 3c509
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 16:42:01 GMT

I'm stumped on this and hoping that one of you kind souls on the net
has a few words of wisdom to share about this problem.  Please reply
by email, as this is probably not of general interest.

I've got an AST Power Premium 4/33 (486, 33MHz, EISA) with a 3Com
3c509 card, and an Adaptek 1510A SCSI card with a Hitachi CDR-6750 CD
drive hanging off of it.  I'm running Linux 1.1.0 from the Yggsdrasil
Summer 1994 CD.

The Problem: networking is unreliable, and I don't know whether to
blame the card, the software, my config files, or the phase of the
moon.

The Symptoms: Sometimes I boot, log in, and have perfect network
access.  Sometime I boot, log in and any network access (eg. ping or
telnet) will cause the following to loop infinitely on the screen:

    eth0: Infinite loop in interrupt, status 2013

and I have to do a hardware reset.  Sometimes I boot, log in, and my
first one or two attempts at network access will generate one of the
following two messages:

    eth0: Missed interrupt, status then 2013 now 2013 Tx 00 Rx 3a1c
or
    eth0: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status 2002

and subsequent attempts at access are successful.

Also, syslogd sometimes spews messages like the following until I
reboot; I've noticed no correlation between syslogd's spewage and the
above eth0 messages:

Sep 29 06:22:25 test-tod routed[32]: adding route to net/host 192.104.85.0 through gateway 192.104.85.0: Network is unreachable 

I have no clue where routed is getting the idea that it wants to add
all these entries to it's tables.  I certainly don't find them in any
of my /etc files.

What I've done: I've checked for conflicting IRQ's and found none, nor
have I found conflicting base addresses.  The 3Com supplied
diagnostics for the 3c509 reveal no problems, they merely agree with
what Linux autodetects.  My netmask, broadcast address, and the other
magic net numbers are all correct for our subnet.

I've brought up Linux machines before (SLS and Debian distributions)
and have not had this degree of difficulty.  Either I'm overlooking
something, the card is problematic, or the software / distribution is
faulty.  The first case would be the easiest to deal with.

Relevant files:

/etc/rc.net:

PATH=$PATH:/usr/net/bin
ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
route add 127.0.0.1
ifconfig eth0 128.135.53.248 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 128.135.53.255
route add 128.135.53.0
route add default gw 128.135.53.1
/usr/net/daemons/routed &
/usr/net/daemons/inetd &

/etc/host.config:

order hosts,bind
# multi

/etc/hosts:

127.0.0.1       localhost

/etc/networks:

loopback        127.0.0.0

/etc/resolv.conf:

domain lib.uchicago.edu
nameserver      128.135.53.3
nameserver      128.135.53.2
nameserver      128.135.4.2

There is no /etc/gateways.

Thanks in advance.

No problem building a firewall, I didi it this way
1) Installed minimal slackware distribution a d and n series
2) Get firewall toolkit from ftp.tis.com
3) Get skey from crimelab.com
4) Get httpd from info.cern.ch
5) compile  and install all after reading docs for some nights

Now you got proxyservers for telnet, ftp, rlogin, www (mosaic)
and some good security also one time passwords

I you have only heard second hand info then how can you make a fair
assessment of an operating system?  Plain and simple, there is no best
operating system.  There are, however, best operations systems for a
specific task.  If you want to read news, do "standard" unix stuff
then linux or one of the free BSD's is fine.  If you want to do
real-time operations (according to the true definition of real time,
not what most people think real-time is) then these don't even come
close.  Something like Lynx or QNX is best suited for this task.
These tasks will almost always require a lot of custom code, so
portability isn't (in most cases) a big issue.  There are times,
though, when QNX or Lynx don't cut it either, like with multiprocessor
DSP systems.  For these SPOX or Virtuoso is best.

Yes... sorry about that and thanks for the info.

I also got a reply that I should pass along to the rest of the group. The 
key when using this technique is that the ip addresses of the point 
to point slip connection should be on the same subnet as the ethernet 
conection... no need to waste another subnet for a simple slip connection.
I was confused about the concept until this piece fell into place. Then I 
slapped my self in the head and said, of course!

if you ran through your sndserver with sed as was explained in the readme
associated with sndcvt, mknod the /tmp/dsp and run sndcvt &, you should get
sound.. NOTE: pre 2.90 voxware drivers will have sound delayed by about 4 or
so seconds (enough to make it very disconcerting).. i upgraded my kernel to
1.1.45 which includes 2.90-2 drivers and everything works fine.. i also
believe that the 2.90 voxware drivers do not compile on kernels below
1.1.18.. if anyone actually has the kernel number could you please post it..
as my onfo is probably faulty (but i know it wont work on 1.0.8)
