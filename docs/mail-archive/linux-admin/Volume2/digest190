        Are there any documents, files, how-to's, faqs, etc., anywhere 
that helps with the install of PPP? Everthing that I've found states that 
PPP is new and no documentation is developed yet. Surely something must 
exist by now.

The files in /dev are not like DOS device drivers.  The program code 
to implement different devices is compiled into the kernel.  Files in
/dev just map a device name like "/dev/hda1" into a major and minor
device number, like 3, 1.  The kernel then uses these numbers to figure
out how to treat the device.

To create the entry you need in /dev, try (as root)

        mknod c /dev/bmousems 10 2

10 and 2 are the major and minor device numbers you need, and c tells the
kernel that the mouse is a character (unbuffered) device.

Good Luck,

I suppose I was unclear.  What I meant: someone who does this may be
commiting a crime (they are) but they are not necessarily a criminal
in the sense that you probably think about criminals.  You have a nice
label that allows you to feel certain things about anyone you plaster it
on. If all you meant by criminal ws "someone who has broken the law" then
i would agree.   But you probably don't, even if you think you do.  I
am not (if you people could get it through your thick heads) in favor
of system cracking.  What i am AGAINST is the mindless damning of anyone
to ever bypass a login prompt.  Some of these people are 11-12 year old
children.  I'm not even saying that they should be treated any
differently because of this.  I am saying your label of criminal may
not fit.  I am opposing a knee-jerk reaction to someone that has done
something that you -> have a perfect right to be upset about, and a legal
right to get them in trouble <-  but really has in many cases not done any
harm.  I.e.: someone uses cycles on my Linux box.  They are essentially
free.  I may not want him there, but it is possible for him to enter and
leave and *do me no harm.*  Did I say this makes it "okay."?  Don't
respond to what I am not saying.  It is also possible for someone to
enter your house and do you no harm.  NOT "do you no wrong" but "do
you no harm."  Can you accept this statemnt, with no implications?  

Folks, opposing a statement that is true for what you think it may imply
is pathetic.  First and foremost is the truth of a statement.   Statement
"A" if true, is still true if the consequence of believing it is the
destruction of all living things.  My point: do what you like.  People
should not enter your system.  If you bend reality in your mind, you
are pathetic.

I will be setting up a Linux box very soon which will be connected to

are several printers on the Netware which I would like to access, but
I don't think I can from Linux.  Or can I?  If anyone knows anything

Subject: bugs and stuff: rpc.portmap, grep
Date: 13 Oct 1994 22:01:24 GMT

I have a couple of problems I'd like to see if anybody can fill me in
on.  First, some config info:

1.1.53 kernel
16 megs RAM
Buslogic SCSI
3com ethernet
Soundblaster 16
ATI GUP VLB

1) I'm running rpc.portmap, rpc.nfsd and rpc.mountd to export some stuff
via NFS.  Everything seems to work fine, except once every couple of days,
rpc.portmap decides that it's broken and should respawn.  Unfortunately,
it doesn't kill itself first, so the second copy exits because the port
is still held by the first copy.  Thus is begins an infinite loop of
respawning and dieing because the first copy won't go away.  If you kill
the first copy, the next copy that loads will be happy and it stops.
I don't even know why the first copy becomes unhappy, but I'm getting
tired of getting back to the computer to find it happily crunching away
with a load of close to 2 because of portmap.  I know for a fact that
nothing was going on with NFS the last several times it's happened, so
I don't know what to blame it on.

2) GNU grep version 2.0 only pays attention to what appears to be the
first 80 characters of each line?  Is this a new feature?

Any feedback is appreciated,

I've been on the net since I was ARPA technical person for GE's *only*

I would rather have a problem complete with solution, but I would really

There are two copies of the passwd command in the SLS release, one for

I am having similar troubles with printing on my HP 4L.

I got the following when printing a text file:

    # ls -l consult.book
    -rw-r--r--   1 tom      users         506 Jan 27  1994 consult.book
    # lpc stat
    lp:
            queuing is enabled
            printing is enabled
            no entries
            no daemon present
    # lpr consult.book
    # echo $?
    0
    # lpc stat
    lp:
            queuing is enabled
            printing is enabled
            no entries
            no daemon present
    # 

And wala!  No printout.  The light doesn't even blink.
But it prints fine from MS-DOG.

The printcap entry follows (maybe this is the problem):

    # Hewlett-Packard Laser Jet:
    lp|hplj:\
            :lp=/dev/lp0:\
            :sd=/usr/spool/lp0:\
            :mx#0:\
            :of=/usr/spool/lp0/hplj:

I get *some* output if I just 'cat' the file to /dev/lp0,
but it has the "staircase" effect.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yep!
In fact, we'd need a user programmable LCD (2x40?) screen for:

-serial port status
-system load
-custom peripheral status (like your amateur radio...)

You probably just have things in the wrong place, like fvwm not being on the 
path, not moving or symlinking /usr/X11/lib/X11/fvwm to the
appropriate place, not having your old shared libraries in an
appropriate place and in /etc/ld.so.conf, etc.

Once I'd moved everything around, fvwm and its modules worked with no
problems.

Could your motherboard/bus/graphics adaptor stand an upgrade (esp. as
you find X important)?  There seem to be quite cheap and tasty PCI
mboards available with onboard (NCR) SCSI-2 and 16550 serial ports - add
the cost of that and a PCI graphics card and see how much money you've
got left for some RAM and disk space.....you could maybe get a nice fast
SCSI-2 hdd too.  I'd rather take this route and make to with 8Mb RAM
until I could afford more.  You'd have to sell the simms you've now got
first though probably.

Volgens mij, tenminste :-)   Hoeveel geld heb je ?

Somewhat true. But you will need the libraries, and you might as well get
them all because they all come together; in the future I suspect precompiled
binaries will use the new libraries. And if you have the libraries and the
server, there is not much reason you should link your own binaries with
the old libraries, so you might as well get the headers. Also you will
need the updated man pages, which all come together. 

So about the only thing you end up not really needing to upgrade is the 
fonts.

I would guess that from about now on,  most precompiled X binaries
will be linked with the R6 libraries. Going to 3.1 (keep your old libraries
too!) will give you some backwards compatibility, since the R6 server
can work with your older binaries.
