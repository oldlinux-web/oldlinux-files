Hi.

I have two simple questions ....


1. How do I get rid of LILO?  It's sitting on my hard disk's master
boot sector and I am unable to remove it!!!

2. Is there an X server for ATI mach64 (WINTURBO) out there?  And if
so, how do I get it?


Thx.

I think the kernel is over 512k in size (or around 500k in size).  The lilo
README that comes with the source explains that a kernel cant be over a
certain size, or it cant load it.  You probably need to recompile your
kernel, and take out some uneeded drivers to make the kernel smaller.

Reply-To: wescott@acm.org

A while back I posted a question about using pppd with init so that I
could keep a constant PPP link.  My original question was how to stop
pppd from respawning too fast, and after some help from a few people
and some more manual-page reading, I added the -detach option.
However, I *still* cannot get init to spawn pppd correctly.  Here are
the relevant files:

Yes, You will get a NT1 card and power supply.  The bell's do not supply
line power in the USA for ISDN.  I think, in other counties they do.

If you are running BRI (Bacis Rate Interface) That is what most home users
have.  You will Need a NT1 card for your computer that will connect to the
U interface that you RBOC will install. plus the power for the NT1..

No, The NT1 will use both B Channels as well as the D channel.
With this you can have one link to your provider and be talking on your 
ISDN Digital phone each on one B (64KPS) channel while downing a file
from your local BBS on the D 16 kps or (9600 or 14.4 modem speed) channel.

Look over on comp.telcom.isdn or something like that.
I have a WWW address but, can not remember it right now.
I think you can gopher bellcore as well.

E-mail me for the address..


Hope this helps out.

Date: Sun, 16 Oct 1994 00:37:11 GMT

Hi,
        I want to have a permanent conneciton between my Linux box (SLS, with
kernel 1.1.18 and no patches) and a Telebit NetBlazer at the other end
(connected with 2 Hayes Optima 288's). It all seems to work fine, just until
the part where I need the remote address of the other end of the connection.
pppd doesn't receive it and it dies out with:
ipcp: up
Could not determine remote IP address
ipcp: down

anyone out there have any ideas?

On another note, are the any known problems with 1.1.18 and PPP 2.1.2a ?
Should I move up to 1.1.49 or something? The main reason is that I want to be
able toi run all the networking stuff that currently seeemd to work with
1.1.18 (I don't want to "break" anything that came with SLS).

Please reply via e-mail to patr@iceonline.com.

Hi -

   I run the 1.1.51 kernel on a Gateway P5-90 with 32 megs and 2 540 meg
hard drives. The problem I have is with the mouse.
   I was under the impression that the mouse that came with the system was
a bus mouse. I have tried setting up the kernel, and the selection start-up
(in rc.local) appropriately but I always get the same error on start up:
   ms_init: no such device.

   Am I completely off base? I also tried setting the mouse up as a serial 
mouse but to no avail. All help is appreciated as the lack of a mouse stops
me from running X.

   Thanks in advance.

   Well, we have a net setup here, and I want to make a backup using

   The problem lies with /usr/bin/rsh, which will require a password

   (non-interactively, as in rsh woody pwd

   Now is there a possibility of getting this to work? At the moment,
   I have made a file /usr/ucb/rsh (first place tar looks) which is
   just root executable and has exec su nobody -c "exec /usr/bin/rsh
   $*" in it. Somewhat of a weak solution. Anybody know any better
   one? 

Looks like someone should modify GNU tar to work like GNU cpio.  That
program allows the specification of a username as well as a host name
for the tape device.  Our preferred method is to run cpio on the
machine to be backed up, with an archive file specification like:

backup@host:/dev/nrmt0h

and to then include root on each of the machines to be backed up in
the ~/.rhosts file for user backup on the tape server.  This allows
backups without root access to the tape server.

FWIW, I've got 2.0.1 from late Sept., with the 10-disk NTeX.
Metafont writes in /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/tmp/pk/localfont when it
needs to make a *pk file.  It works fine, exactly as installed.
(A good thing, too.  I would *never* have figured out how to assemble and
isntall this massive package myself.)
I just tried it as an unpriveleged user (again) with a document that uses
cmbx6 and cmr10,
  dvips -o 360k.ps 360k.dvi
ls -ld says
  drwxrwxrwt   2 root     root         1024 Oct 14 22:34\
 /usr/lib/texmf/fonts/tmp/pk/localfont/
I would have bin.bin own it, but what do I know?

What a great setup!  Thanks Patrick!

Q2 sounds fine but it is not supported by many modems. I believe it is a 
non-standard extension of the Hayes command.
