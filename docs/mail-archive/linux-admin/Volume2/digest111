This posting did not come from our office, but we are tracing it.
If you look carefully at headers you will find sites that don't exist, 
and see that it does not trace back to scheidel@gate.net.

We have a good idea of who it is and some admins are helping us trace it 
by comparing the posting on their machine to other postings.

If you have the time and ability to help us trace this, we can give you 
info on who is doing it and maybe try to pressure HIS site to drop him.

Again, I did not do this post, and we have taken great pains to avoid 
offending anyone, and to date this is my first flame, even if undeserved.

I thank those who looked at headers and saw it was a forgery, and look 
forward to a solution to this.

Also, note that in general, it's probably not wise to call test programs "test",
or if you do, don't forget to type "./test".  Otherwise you'll be running
/bin/test, and then you'll *really* be stumped!! ;-)

  There is a command known as dmesg. It shows the contents of the
message buffer for kernel messages. When used right after boot that
means that it shows all of the boot messages.

I would like to know too, I have a Diamond Speedstar 64 PCI which uses the

works fine for all the display modes, except when I exit, then when screen

Subject: Upgrade my Linux - where from?
Date: 26 Sep 1994 21:50:12 GMT

I have a newbie type question.  I have the 1.1.18 kernel version.
I would like to upgrade to a newer version of linux.

I have ftp'd to sunsite.unx.edu in the /pub/Linux directory, and I'm not 
sure where to go from there.

When I upgraded from 1.0.8 I had a CD-ROM that had the kernel sources in 
it.  I just copied 'em down off the CD and make'd the system as usual.

Where are the sources, so I can do the same thing?
And what version (as of today is a stable one) that I should get?

Signed,
Confused

Hi. Linuxers.

I am having difficulty mounting Mitusmi CD. 
I upgraded the kernel from 1.0.9 to 1.1.49 recently, and now
I don't seem to be able to mount CD.

Whenever I try, mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt

I get an error,

Any ideas.?

Subject: Tape backup info?
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 1994 15:25:31 GMT

I've finally decided to get a tape backup for my Linux system.  The
problem is I know nothing about tape backups, let alone what might
work under Linux.  I already have 2 floppies, and I seem to recall
that the tape backup devices take the place of one floppy; then again,
that was some years ago.

So, is there a document somewhere where I might find advice as to
which brand to purchase (cheepest, yet one that works with Linux), and
what s/w I need under Linux (I assume just tar, but....).

Or, if you have a tape backup working under Linux, and also have two
floppy drives installed, please e-mail me with specs.  I'll post a
summary.

Thanks!

you need to edit /etc/rc.d/inet2.rc (maybe I misspelled it) but anyhow:

uncomment the rpc.mountd and other relevent entries for these services,
then reboot.

I'm running Slackware 1.2, and this worked for me.

Try cd'ing to the directory where the manpage resides, then
        nroff -man page.x |lpr

This should work

Date: 26 Sep 1994 23:28:06 -0400

I have installed, compiled, and tried the `mkisofs' and `cdwrite' software
which makes a CDROM partition image and copies it onto a CD-R media.

I am running Linux-1.1.18-UMSDOS kernel with an ADAPTEC 1542CF SCSI card.

`mkisofs' works great - as well as the mucho-bucks YM solution. I wrote an
ISO9660 partition into a blank partition and mounted it without incident.

`cdwrite' takes some setup.  To date, I have been unable to get it to work
because I can't build a `GENERIC SCSI SUPPORT' kernel for it which will
allow the device to show up as a device, though the `Inquiry' feature
finds the `IMS device ...' string upon kernel installation at boottime.

Anybody got any ideas?  Can anybody mail me a FAQ? a HOWTO? 

Thanks enormously!

I have a strange problem with NFS and filesystem checking.
Since I started to mount my home directory it started.

NFS Client: Kernel is 1.1.8, Slackware 2.0, e2fsck 0.5a, sysVinit,
NFS Server: Kernel is 1.1.45, Slackware 2.0

NFS Server, /etc/exports:
/home clientmachine (rw)

NFS Client, /etc/fstab
host:/home/user /home/user nfs defaults

All works fine except
while accidently having my home directory mounted,
I pressed CTRL&ALT&DEL to shutdown which does a

shutdown -t3 -rf now

according to initab.
Last action is a

umount -a

in rc.0 which complained and threw
me in single user mode with a prompt.

Anytime I want to shutdown now,
I login as root,

umount -a -t nfs,
shutdown -t3 -r now,

and after killing all processes
Linux on the client machine complains with:

wired, clean, and not updateable buffer in list 0

I just become root in one of my Xterms, and do

I'll reply to this, since the original posting was mine, I guess...

This is, of course, the opposite of the situation we were originally
talking about, the same address on two different interfaces.  This one
here is useful for running one machine with multiple names as well.

I've been asked to condense my postings about using Linux as a router for
the Networking HOWTO by it's editor; I'll be scribbling today.

Subject: Access problem after changin root password
Date: Mon, 26 Sep 1994 03:04:39 GMT

After installing Linux 0.99.15g I changed the root password and now 
cannot log in as root either with the password I set, or with the default 
(blank) password. 

Obviously, I have to reinstall Linux, but want to avoid this problem. Can 
someone email a clue to this poor newbie?

Thankx     :)
