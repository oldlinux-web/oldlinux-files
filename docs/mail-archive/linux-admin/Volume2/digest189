  Yup, I think so. It's been a while that I made a SCSI tar tape
  with several archives on a tape, so I can't give the *exact*
  answer. I don't have the HOWTO at work here neither. Whatever...

  You should use the non-rewinding device, described in the
  SCSI-HOWTO for multiple archives. That worked for me.
  It's the same device name as the normal scsi tape name, but
  with a letter 'n' appended. Check it out. Hope this helps...

<sigh>

I would like to consider myself to be a hacker.  (Others may disagree -- as
the quote below states, it is a title best given, not taken.)  I have never
broken into a system.  I do not plan on doing so at any time in the future.
The term `hacker' has been perverted by some to refer to criminals who
attempt to penetrate security on computer systems.  This was not the
original meaning of the word.  To refer to such people as `hackers' is to
give them a dignity they do not deserve.

The following is an entry from the jargon file, available from GNU archives
everywhere as `jarg300.txt.gz'.

:hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
   1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
   systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
   users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
   programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
   programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
   person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is
   good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,
   or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in `a UNIX
   hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
   fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One
   might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
   intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
   limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to
   discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence `password
   hacker', `network hacker'.  The correct term is {cracker}.

   The term `hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
   community defined by the net (see {network, the} and
   {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described
   is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ethic (see
   {hacker ethic, the}.

   It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
   oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an
   elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
   members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego
   satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
   you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
   {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.

Agreed.  If there is a hole on my system, I want to know about it yesterday.
I don't want someone to say, ``There is a hole, do this to fix it.  Sorry,
we won't tell you what the hole is.''

Good luck! :>

>P.S. -- Is there a distribution with a patch for the smail bug?

I believe the latest version of Slackware includes sendmail 8.6.9, which
does not have either the debug file bug, or the .forward misconfiguration.

Lets face it, the most rational solution is to use a key mapping or
such.  If they have access to your machine, they can reboot it
anyways.  Its better to have them doing it from the keyboard than
with the reset or power buttons...  But, since most people won't
settle for that answer, how about a crontab job:

* * * * *  if [ -f /priv/reboot ]; then rm -f /priv/reboot;/sbin/reboot; fi

Then users having access to /priv can reboot, everyone else can't, 
unless they hose your computer with the reset or power buttons.

Correction:  There were 3 bugs in smail...  They were fixed almost as
rappidly as they where reported.  By the time the new reached the
announce groups, those who had been monitoring the smail newsgroup
already had there systems fixed.  Those who hadn't been monitoring
the smail newsgroup have been running around like chickens with there

Did you reverse things there?  "smail" is probably the simpliest thing
to install on my whole system.  Much easier than libc, XFree86-3.1,
...  I've had several people contact me asking how to use term over
sendmail.  My typical responce is to give them my recompiled smail 
binaries and get them up and running in about 15-45 minuites,
depending on whether they have "term" installed correctly...

I don't know about that.  The "smail" bugs where found awfully fast.
I think each one had a lifetime of less that 24 hours.

Yep.  Speaking of security problems, anyone know what the login(1)
scare was a while back.  That is one case where neither the hole
nor the solution where posted, just a note to get the xxxx patch
to fix it.   Being lazy, I just tooked my machine off the net for
a while and then eventually picked-up a new executable.  But it
would be nice to know what the problem was.

The TCP keep-alive timer should not be used to shut down a connection if the
remote end cannot be reached.  An implementation that does is incorrect.  
You don't have to take my word on this -- the issue comes up often in the
tcpip newgroup when someone asks "how can tell when a networked PC has been
turned off".

What the keep-alive packets can do is detect when a machine has been
rebooted and the connection endpoint no longer exists.

I've been running an ASUS SP3G with the on-board bus-master NCR SCSI
controller and a Boca PCnet/PCI bus-master ethercard.  I've had no problems
since I've reverted to the factory BIOS setting.  Sample size: 2 machines x
1 week.

Yes, it is in the way you are using it.  You are not visiting it in
a physical location.  All past tresspassing laws have been based on this.
The fact that a "tresspasser" here is different in a very significant way
merits thought.  This is all that I am saying.  I never denied it would
be polite to ask first.  I stated that there is a difference.  True 
statement.  

I did not imply ANYHTING.  I made a true statement.  A and B are different.
Not that A is wrong and B is not.  Or that B should necessarily
be treated differently from A (though it should be cosidered.)

"totally harmless"...  "in and of itself"...

What do you call this other than a retarded "rationalization" for "it's OK to  
break in, so long as you don't do anything but logoff"?  Speaking of "not  
reading" -- did you bother to read the _rest_ of my post?  For your  
edification:

        If I simply walked up to your front door, picked the lock, opened the 
        door, and then walked away -- would you feel any less secure?  I'll 
        bet you'd figure out how to put a better lock on the door.  When 
        people put password protection on their systems, it is simply a means 
        to prevent _unwanted_ access to their systems.  People know (most of 
        them anyway) that the password protection is no more of a guarantee 
        than a deadbolt on the front door, but it is an attempt -- with the 
        tools at hand.  When you break that protection, you have violated 
        their _wishes_ (100% of the time -- not even 99%), otherwise they 
        wouldn't have placed the restriction on the system in the first 
        place.  Even if they have it _poorly_ protected, that simply says 
        more about thier _ability_ to protect the system -- not about thier 
        intentions.

How can you reasonably say there was "no harm done"?  Stealing privacy from  
someone is _significant_ harm -- that goes on harming for a long time after  
the original infringement.

:>Clearly, you have alot to learn about being _human_...

:I'm through with this thread.  Nobody seems to get it.  This (now
:worthless) discussion simply stemmed from a response to a dogmatic view
:about system crackers.  I don't care who you express an incorrect
:view about, be it a murderer, I will attack it.  This does not
:mean I am defending murder.  This does not mean I am advocating murder.  Do
:you understand this?  Expressly: I do not advocate system cracking.  I 
:also do not advocate blanket statements about system crackers, murderers
:or anyone else.  If you have not the intellectual capacity to understand
:why being correct even in damning someone or some group, no matter how
:much one would like to just damn away indiscriminately, is important, then
:I give up.   

_You_ simply didn't get it...  It is _not_ a dogmatic view.  It is an  
_extremely_ personal reaction to a _very_bad_ argument.  Compromising  
someone's privacy is an _extremely_ serious offense "in and of itself".
