I've got a Trantor 130B SCSI card in my computer at school.  As far as I know,
there's no support from Linux.  Anybody got a patch?  I used the T128, but as
the source says, it doesn't work since the architecture is different.

Subject: getty problem
Date: 17 Oct 1994 23:31:36 GMT

My goal is to set up a pppd server, patiently waiting for a remote ppp
process to connect.

However, I'm trying to get getty to work properly, and it ain't
happening.  To me, this shouldn't be a difficult problem, so either
I've overlooked something, or I've got a piece of broken software.

The Gory Details:

- Linux 1.1.47
- ppp-2.1.2a
- getty_ps-2.0.7e

I'm testing the connection from another Unix box (SPARC, running SunOS
4.1.3_U1) using direct cabling.  One cable is a null modem cable, the
other is a straight-through cable.  I've succeeded in verifying that
they can talk.  That is, I can cu from the Sun, and while connected, I
can run 'date >/dev/ttyS0' on the Linux host, and it displays
properly.  (Well, not entirely.  It 'barber-poles'.  But at least the
speed is right.)

But I *never* get a login prompt.  If I hit newline a couple times, I
get a segmentation fault from getty listed in the logfile.  And this
was *after* I created the file /etc/getty/getty/getty.ttyS0 with some
parameters (see below).  Before I set this file up, getty was
segfaulting and respawning every couple seconds (according to syslog),
finally disabling it:  "respawning too fast: disabled for 5 minutes".

This is my getty.ttyS0 file:

  DELAY=1
  WAITCHAR=YES

Just for fun, I added the following line, and the desired string
actually displays just prior to giving me a segfault:

  CONNECT=\r \shello\sthere!\n\r

On a lark, I've tried setting it to use /dev/cua0, but it's no better.

So, what am I up against?

  1. User Brain Damage.
  2. broken software
  3. bad wiring
  4. some/all of the above

Any/all helpful suggestions will be warmly received.

Request responses via email, as I regrettably rarely have the
luxury of reading news.  :-(

TIA.

    It isn't so much DMA as it is reselection that allows slower SCSI
    devices to coexist with faster ones.  While the overall transfer rate
    of a CDRom is slow, it still packetizes the data so each 'sector'
    is collected and then transfered at full speed.  Data from other
    SCSI devices can be transfered inbetween the data coming from the CDRom.

    At least theoretically.

    What bus mastering / DMA does is free up the cpu to do other things
    while a transfer is going on, rather then have to sit in a loop.

Ummm, sounds like an intr (usually ^c) ... try running a program and
pressing backspace; it should behave as if you "pressed ^c". Enter the
command "stty -a" to see the status of the special characters.

>Anyway, I noticed that the ONLY time this happend was when I logged out of

The defaults for the special characters are in /usr/include/linux/tty.h.
They may be changed by getty, login (see /etc/login.defs), or
by stty or tset commands in /etc/profile, in $HOME/.profile (or
$HOME/.bash_profile etc. etc.), in $HOME/.bashrc (that is a bad idea,
though). In particular, mgetty sets intr=^?. 

I guess that if you log out of the shell calling openwin, there
is no controlling tty, and the terminal emulators revert to their
defaults, which for some strange reason may be different between
xterm and color_xterm (someone please correct me on all this...).
You might try grepping the color_xterm source for "erase" and "intr"
to see what it thinks the "defaults" are, if any. Also, look through
..../lib/X11/app-defaults/color_xterm or whatever.

>I never found a solution, cept for waiting till X was done booting

In the case of xterm, you can add the option -tm "intr ^c erase ^?"
to the command line to change the intr and erase characters to those
values. You can also set the resource ttyModes. RTFM xterm for more
information.

Same for mgetty. Anyway, the proper way would be to fix the shadow suite
instead of having to work around in every getty program.

Yes, ftape is in another package, and you also need yet another package
(modutil) to load the ftape.  They are all in sunsite under
/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes.

Since you have a pretty new kernel, you should grab that dma-irq patch too.

With you grab all those packages, you will have yet another hell of a time
trying to figure out how does the darn thing work.

I'll say it again.  When I telnet from a LAN workstation whose

delay.  When I add the host to the /etc/hosts, the connection is
almost instant....

If this doesn't help you, it would be helpful to know.

Hello alls, 

I've been a happy linux user/sysadmin for almost two years now,
even happier now that my machines have access to the net (thank god
for PPP and low cost service providers :),  however, now that
my machine is supporting more than two simultaneous users (more like
4-5 at any given time, i know, still not a lot, but read on), most of whom
are running screen (in addition to me running X on the console), i'm 
starting to run out of ptys!  I've used MAKEDEV to try to make more,
but that doesn't seem to have quite worked.  Any ideas on what I should
do?

I'm running slackware 1.0, but my kernel has been up'd to 1.1.50.

Thanks in advance!

        I know we can do this, but we want a concensus within the
Linux community to go one way or the other.  It would be better to
switch to XFree86's incompatable libraries than have half of the
Linux community using our R5-compatable binding's and half using
XFree86's R5-incompatable bindings.

        I agree that if we're going to make a change, it might be better
to go with ELF a month or two early than to switch twice.

If anyone is interested, Dell used to (still does?) make computers with a
four character display.  I have a 486D/33 with one.  Dell included a small
program for DOS that allows is to either display a clock, or it can scroll
a message specified on the command line.  Without the program, I think it
shows the sector and the drive being accessed.  Since it is a DOS program,
my display just shows the time of day when I booted Linux using loadlin.

There's also ftp.cdrom.com (SF Bay area).  Look in /.4/linux.  Not quite

   To say nothing of timeout problems.  I've got a two-controller
setup on my system, and I've had recurrent problems with the aha1542
driver locking up my system and dying horribly because when it gets
a reset interrupt from one of the cards, it then has to go out and
reset every gawdforsaken device it can find.  About halfway through,
the interrupt handler gets swapped out and the scheduler freaks,
converting a perfectly usable 486 box into an inefficient space
heater.

Another thing that may be considered is that many cases sold today
have a 2 or 2 1/2-digit LED display, usually jumpered to show the CPU
speed.  If it can be removed from the jumper setup, it would be quite
useful for showing the load average (0-20, with one decimal place).
Seeing the system load is definitely something useful, rather than the
CPU speed, which doesn't change (surprise!).

The easiest way to feed it would probably be through a parallel port,
using latches hooked to the status pins to load a digit at a time,
alternatively using decoder circuitry to pack 2 1/2 digits into 8 data
pins + 3 status pins (1/2 digit, 2 decimal points), but thet way it
would not be possible to use it for anything but digits.

It probably would be necessary to dedicate a parallel port, but that
shouldn't be that big of a deal given what I/O cards cost these days.
