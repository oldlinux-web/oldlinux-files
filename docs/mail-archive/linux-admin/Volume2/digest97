    Hi, I am trying to set up a news feed form sprint and I am having a 
lot to problems. First I added news.sprintlink.net and for test purposes 
added dns.novanet.com to /usr/lib/news/host.nntp when I am on 
dns.novanet.com and telnet to port 119 I get connect refused. Why is this 
do you need something other then dns.novanet.com in that file. Also when 
I start INN I run /usr/lib/news/etc/rc.news and I think that all I need 
to d. Is it, is there a way to run it at startup? Oh, I also removed the 
nntp line in /etc/ined.conf, sprint said I needed to. Please, If you can 
help send me some mail I need to get this working today, sprint dose not 
work on the weekends. :-)

Thank's for all of your help.

I have been banging my head against this one for weeks now.  

rlogin, rsh, etc. work fine if I am loged in over a network line, but
if I am at the console ( actualy xdm controlling logins ) r* break 
with the error 'connection refused'.  Also  a similar thing happens
with gopher.  It works fine if I am logged in over the network ( even
if only the loopback ) but not under a terminal window in X. I have
compared the environments that get set ans they seem to agree.  Can
anyone give me clues as to where to look to fix this problem?

Thanks in advance for any hints.

You have two possibilities, and the answer depend on your choice:

(A) subnetting,
(B) proxy ARP or host route.

Let's assume that your network is 192.168.17.*. (All 192.168.* networks
are free for internal uses.)


(A) Subnetting:

The easy way. Advisable if there is no lack of IP adresses for you, but
you can put at most 62 machines on the Ethernet if you have a class C
net. 

Example configuration:

192.168.17.65   B
192.168.17.66   A
192.168.17.129  B-slip
192.168.17.130  C

B must have IP forwarding enabled!

-on A:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.17.66 netmask 255.255.255.192 broadcast 192.168.17.127
route add -net 192.168.17.64
route add -net default gw 192.168.17.65
        [ or route add -net 192.168.17.128 gw 192.168.17.65 ]

-on B:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.17.65 netmask 255.255.255.192 broadcast 192.168.17.127
route add -net 192.168.17.64

#if have slattached the line
ifconfig sl0 192.168.17.129 pointopoint 192.168.17.130
route add -host 192.168.17.130
#else
        just put C into your /etc/diphosts file

-on C:
#if you have slattached the line
ifconfig sl0 192.168.17.130 pointopoint 192.168.17.129
route add -host 192.168.17.129
route add -net default gw 192.168.17.129
        [ or route add -net 192.168.17.64 netmask 255.255.255.192 gw 192.168.17.129 ]
#else put into your dip script:
get $local 192.168.17.130
get $remote 192.168.17.129
default

Answers to your questions in this case:
(1) Yes.
(2) Yes.
(3) Different.
(3) Required, only on B.
(4) Gateway.


(B) Proxy ARP (or host route):

Advisable if you're lacking IP adresses (e.g. because you have several
SLIP connections of this kind) or if you have some machines in your net
that don't understand subnetting (or subnetting with odd masks).

Example configuration:

192.168.17.1    B
192.168.17.2    A
192.168.17.3    C

B must have IP forwarding enabled!
You don't need a second IP address for B (but if won't do damage
either).

-on A:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.17.2
route add -net 192.168.17.0

-on B:
ifconfig eth0 192.168.17.1
route add -net 192.168.17.0
arp -s 192.168.17.3 <B's Ethernet address> pub

#if you have slattached the line
ifconfig sl0 192.168.17.1 pointopoint 192.168.17.3
route add -host 192.168.17.3 dev sl0
#else
        just put C into your /etc/diphosts file

-on C:
#if you have slattached the line
ifconfig sl0 192.168.17.3 pointopoint 192.168.17.1
route add -net default gw 192.168.17.1
        [ or route add -net 192.168.17.0 gw 192.168.17.1 ]
#else put into your dip script:
get $local 192.168.17.3
get $remote 192.168.17.1
default

<B's Ethernet address> is the address in the form like 12:34:56:78:9a:bc
that is shown when the Ethernet card is detected at startup.

You could leave out the "arp -s ..." on B if you give a
route add -host 192.168.17.3 gw 192.168.17.1 on A (i.e. on every
machine on the Ethernet except B).

Answers to your questions in this case:
(1) Not wrong, but why?
(2) One network.
(3) Different.
(3) Required, only on B.
(4) Direct by A, gateway by B and C.


Hope this helps,
        Johannes

I've installed it three times (Slakware 2.0) and it has worked flawlessly
each time.  Not that I'm a heavy user; I'm just learning UNIX.  Don't

I want to get rid of the "mounting unchecked filesystems" error.
Running fsck by hand doesn't seem to clear this flag.  It seems
like it should be possible to run fsck and have do its stuff
only if the disk was unmounted cleanly or the max number of
mounts was passed, etc.

How do I set this up?  Where to I put fsck in my startup?
I thought I found docs for this once, but I can't locate them
anymore.

(part of the problem is that it's a pain to manually fsck the
root partition because it's always mounted).

Make sure that you update any symbolic links which affect compilation.
For instance, if /usr/include/linux points to /usr/src/linux/include/linux,
then /usr/src/linux had better point to the source tree you want the
include files to come from, etc.

This probably sounds like an "Are you sure it's plugged in?" question
(i.e., insulting), but...  are you sure you were in the right source
tree and compiled the right kernel?  Remember that /usr/src/linux was
probably linked to either the 1.0.9 or 1.1.18 directories, which might
have brought about a problem.  I wince at my own lack of decorum in
even asking this.  (But SOMETHING happened!)

Not if you have an entirely independent source-tree for 1.1.45 that works.
But, again, be careful about maintaining/updating the symbolic links.

Try put a line:

xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = 0x08"

in the X startup script such as xinit.  
This makes the backspace key '^h' instead of the Delete key.
(This makes the backspace key works only, didn't fix the delete key)

If I remember correctly, the Install-Howto states you should use the 
Linux fdisk to create linux partitions, not the DOS fdisk.

Who said anything about needing performance?  If you want that capacity these
days in an IDE drive, that's what you get.  I too am looking into buying
a similar drive (WD 730MB drive for ~$400).  I don't have a VLB, so I'm
looking for two things:  1) Drive capacity, and 2) compatibility with my
current 202MB IDE drive in an ISA setting.  SCSI is not an option for me
(too many $$$).  (By the way, opinions on what to buy and why are always welcome.)

If I ever get a sound card, I'll probably buy one with a SCSI-2 controller,
but good SCSI controller cards (by themselves) can cost as much as disk drives
or good sound sound cards (with SCSI controllers on them!) these days.

You can mount DOS filesystems that aren't space compressed directly under
Linux.  And I just saw a release bulletin for an ALPHA release of
a DoubleSpace compatible file system.  If that is true, you can also
mount your double spaced DOS partitions as well.

These is also the MTools ported to Linux which were much more widely used
before the MSDOS file system was supported.

I don't know of any way to copy to you Linux file system while you are
running DOS, but since you can do it while running Linux, what's the
problem?

You should have no problems.  I keep my DOS stuff around waiting for the
DOSEMU and WINE projects to finish, then in all likelihood, I'll nuke my
DOS stuff in favor of running my DOS and windows apps under Linux and XFree86.

Subject: installing on P90 + 1G HD
Date: 24 Sep 1994 07:01:05 GMT

I'm trying to install another linux box on our subnet.  It's a Pentium 90
with 1G IDE harddrive.  I'm running into serious problems despite my
previous successful experiences with linux installations.

I'm installing slackware via NFS (maze.mit.edu) using the interactive setup
utility.  It should not be too different from installing from CD or disk(ette).
And because I'm installing linux in the first 300meg disk space, the 1024
cylinder problem should not bug me.
Here's my problem:
1) the setup utility claims that installation is complete after configuring
only modem and mouse.  In my past experience, there were netconfig, timeconfig,
and (most important) liloconfig; but not this time.
2) the floppy boot disk is not bootable; (nor the harddrive, see below)
3) because lilo is not configured, rebooting sent me right into dos; activating
linux partition as boot partition (from dos) resulted in a hang
4) manually creating lilo; when adding linux root partition in lilo, I got
"missing boot signature in first sector" warning
5) when boot after installing lilo to MBR, I got "partition table error" message.

Is it possible to copy an entire partition from one disk to another?  since
I already have a few functioning linux boxes.  particularly how to transfer
the kernel boot image, and adding "boot signature."

Thanks; and please cc:jsun@mit.edu in your response
