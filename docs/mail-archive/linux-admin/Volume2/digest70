Hello all,

Does any of you have any comments on the Intel Saturn chipset for
486 DX/DX2 m.boards (PCI/ISA only with 4x72 simm slots)?
Boards come with NCR scsi built-in + IDE +multi I/O.
Have you had any problems using such a board?
Does the NCR 810 scsi work with no problems?
Which version(s) should I look for? (chipset + bios)

I will need to use it with linux/dos/windows/os2/nt.

Please reply via personal e-mail.

Thanks in advance,
Angelo

 I have successfully installed Linux (1.0.9 kernel) on my Midwest Micro
Elite Soundbook.  But I'm NOT an X-pert, and haven't even a clue where to
go or what to do now.

I've attempted to configure XF for my lcd display, but I cannot get any
of the servers to recognise my hardware.

I have a Chips & Tech F65540 controller, and a ???? monitor.
Has anyone else gotten this working?  If so, would you care to share
your config info (specifics please, for this dummy(!?)) so I can learn
to use the X-window environment?  It LOOKS like a very nice GUI, but I've
never used it on any other platform before.

Thanks, LLoydS

Read a bit more.  You can MOUNT a DOS partition, and deal with it as a 
completely accessible filesystem, (with dos filename restrictions of course).
I had trouble once with mtools, and don't recommend it for regular accesss to 
a hard disk.  But you might as well mount your DOS partition, since it
gives better, faster access.

What tools are available to Linux (.9) users which will allow us to 
monitor, track abuse calls?
We would like to track things from the gateway since we have multiple IP 
addresses within our domain environment. In other words, someone telnets 
into 000.000.000.4, our gateway is 000.000.000.1. We'd like to track the 
call from the router/gateway rather than from the .4 machine.
Are there any tools which can help us do these things or any sort of 
tracking of individuals?
I realise folks can fake addresses and so on but for the most part, there 
is a VERY small number of people who bother with that.
Any suggestions, ideas, utility mentions are welcome!

All the so called Enhanced IDE, FAST IDE, or Mode 3 IDE
should be compatible with Linux. In fact, most of the
new manufactured IDE hard drives are all claiming to be
the Enh/Fast/Mode3 hard drives. Without a ENHANCED/MODE3
VL-BUS controller, those drives work just like the
ordinary/mode2 hard drives. I tried a Seagate(Enh) HD 
with Acculogic Enh(mode3) IDE controller 3 months ago and 
encountered some problems. I think the controller is to 
blame. But without certain controllers and drivers, those 
drives will not take advantage of mode 3 features. I 
assume that Linux will need a patch to enable the Enh 
IDE function. Now I have a Seagate mode2, a Maxtor mode3 
and an ordinary VLB IO/IDE controller without a problem. 
And the Maxtor's (master drive) performance doesn't seem 
to boost. 
BTW, your best bet should be a SCSI drive.

I am considering getting another HD and installing linux.

I allready know all of the benefits, so no one has to convince me that
this is a good idea.

BUT, I'm not going to do this unless I can get a foolproof way of
moving files back and forth from one machine to another.  What I
envision is some DOS or linux command that will copy a file from my
linux partition to my DOS partition.  I realize that I could use FTP,
but I would need a third computer to use for temporary storage if I
did this.  What I'm looking for is something completely and totally 
self-contained.

I realize that this has, in all likelyhood, allready been done.  I
just need to hear from someone who has done it in order to console my
fears about totally changing OSes from something that I know, to
something almost totally foreign.

Right ... Only Linux knows about Ext2 filesystems.
I create Linux Swap, Linux Ext2 and MS-DOG filesystems using
Linux's fdisk.

This will work for IDE, ESDI and other disks that appear
as "normal" PC hard disks.  If you are using a SCSI disk,
use the command "fdisk /dev/sda" for the primary disk 
or "fdisk /dev/sdb" for the secondary disk.

I get this message when I type "fdisk" on a system with a
SCSI hard drive.  This is because Linux's fdisk assumes
the device "/dev/hda1" and scsi devices have designations
like "/dev/sda1".


Hope this helps,

Look in  /etc/ftpaccess  and also do a   man ftpaccess   to get more
information on this.  To create a login banner you need to add in a 
line something like:

banner  /var/spool/ftpd/msgs/banner.msg

And that file contains your message that you want displayed before the
login prompt. The line

message /var/spool/ftpd/msgs/welcome.msg   login

displays a file  after the login.

Well, just my two cents worth RE: FA94 release.

I had Yggdrasil ship me out a fall release red he day they got it in.  It 
seems that when you try to install additional software via the graphical 
control panel, they forget to unlink the /usr link from /system_cd/usr, 
so all cp commands to /usr get a read-only file system error.  My 
solution was to manually copy the whole /system_cd/usr to /usr (which is 
linked to my /scsi/linked/usr directory) with cp -Rd, and then remove and 
link the source tree.  You should be able to do a "rm /usr" after the 
control panel is running and have it work.  Unlike the SP94 release, they 
do not install anything into /usr.

RTFM doesn't work all the time.  Sometimes, you have to UTFH (Use The 
F...ing Head)

Just add a line

It will wait 5 seconds before booting the first OS specified in /etc/lilo.conf.

... and half the net is having the same trouble.

Here's the most important thing to remember:

*When using a multi-homed host as a router, EACH interface must have it's
own address.*

Routing on your local host tells IP where to send packets, based on their
destination address.  What you _tell_ the routing code is _which
interface_ to send the packets out on.  Therefore, each interface, (PPP is
an interface) must have a unique address.  Usually, you get the IP address
for your PPP interface from the provider's net, either statically, or
dynamically.  The "inside" address, the one you ifconfig onto your
ethernet interface, is part of your private net (either one you've
registered yourself, or part of a block assigned by your provider.)

A typical route information output in such a case might look like this...

Destination    Gateway          Netmask       Flags   MSS    iface
127.0.0.1      127.0.0.1        255.0.0.0     UH      1536   lo0
199.245.227.0  199.245.227.254  255.255.255.0 U       1436   eth0
default        198.147.221.1    255.255.255.0 U       1436   ppp0

(The person I'm helping with this right now, who owns those addresses,
will recognize them... :-)

This routes packets for the local host to the loopback interface, packets
for the local net (199.245.227) to the local interface which connects to
that net, and packets for every other network number to the PPP interface,
for forwarding to the outside world.

Everyone understand that?  :-)

Cheers,
-- jra
