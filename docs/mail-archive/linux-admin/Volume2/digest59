Subject: ncr53c810 support without PCI bios ?
Date: Tue, 13 Sep 1994 13:32:08 GMT



I have installed the Slackware distribution 
on my old 40MB IDE drive.
The kernel is 1.0.9
I want to install linux on my scsi-drive with ncr53c810
controller.

I know there is a ncr53c810 driver available, but....
my system has no PCI bios at all.
So the question is,  is there a kernel available 
(or patches) with ncr support that doesn't use
the pci-bios ???

thanks,

Your ftpd can't find ls. The path is set at compile time. If ls is in /bin,
try putting a soft link in /usr/bin pointing to /bin/ls... you can find out
where the daemon points by using the strings command to look for /. Somebody
recently posted this answer... and it worked for me. :)

The correct way to measure FPS (that's comparable with the
DOS-version) is to start linuxxdom like this:

linuxxdoom -devparm -timedemo demo?

where ? is a number between 1 and 3 (these are the three prerecorded demos).

The game will start and you will see the demo (played in "slow-motion").
After a while the guy dies and the game exits. You will get two numbers.
Divide the first by the second and multiply by 35. This is your FPS.

On a 486 AMD/40 with 20MB ram and the wad on my dos-partition I get
(with sound enabled) 8.5 FPS. In DOS I get 13 FPS. If I disable sound
the numbers become 11 and 16. (In DOS i still use DOOM 1.2 as GUS support
is better and the engine is faster : 19FPS _with_ sound).

Yes, that was what I hoped. But if I keep lupo (and, of course,
localhost), and add the next name, smail refuses to use it (read: it
doesn't recognize it as 'myself').
I get error messages of the mail beeing refused some 10 or twenty times
until I change the hostname. 
Think I should take an evening and re-read the Manuals.... sigh

Seems like faster, non-ISA video makes the difference again.

The lapses are probably swapping on your machine, since you have only 8MB RAM.
With 16, and not much else going, there will be no swapping.

It is not a problem.  Doom requires LOTS of colors.  It requests these
hundreds of colors from the window manager (hence, you get no color when
you try to run doom without a window manager).  Since it gobbles up all
the colors available, the Xserver/Window Manager have to switch the
palette around when you leave or enter the doom window.  This way, all
the clients can be happy.  This is quite a normal occurance for clients
which request a large amount or all off the palette.

I have an ATI Graphics Ultra Pro and am using the Mach32 X-server.
Linux DOOM is slower than under MS-"DOS", but only by a little bit. (This
is the VLB version of the ATI GUP).
I've got 16 MB of ram, and every bit of it is used up when playing
though.  :-)

Yikes! 8M ram + 8M swap is *not* enough to play DOOM!  I have 16M ram
and I'm *still* swapping quite a bit--but DOOM is still pretty speedy at
normal resolution (not doubled, etc.)  I have like 20M swap or
something.  Also I'm playing the registered WAD off my DOS partition; I
wonder if that matters?  Like does linuxDOOM mmap() the whole WAD file?
Maybe I'll try with a smaller WAD tonight...

If you don't want/have sound support *BE SURE* to rename or move the
sndserver program: if a file with that name exists in the DOOM directory
DOOM will try to play sound regardless, and will be much slower if your
sound doesn't work.  Seems about the same speed if sound is working.

Heck with 16M ram & no swap I can't even compile the kernel (in X
running Emacs, etc.) without running out of memory sooner or later.

The README says linuxDOOM was developed on a 32M machine; I suggest you
go to at least 32M ram+swap.

After changing from NCSA httpd 1.1 to 1.3 under Linux kernel 1.1.23
forked httpds take minutes to exit and consume time and memory.
From client side however al is working properly.
Seems like they timeout instead of exit clearly after transmitting
the requested information. But nothing unusual is in the error_log.
Timeout is 1200 (sec). Playing around doesn't make a big difference
since they exit in about 2 minutes instead of 20.

FTP Sessions behave strange to. If they are interupted TCP connections
stay in the kernel for ever.
Version 1.1.23 was necessary due to big problems with PC/TCP clients with MS-DOS.

Is it the fault of httpd or Linux or mine?
