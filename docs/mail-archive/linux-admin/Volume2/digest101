It seems that every time I boot up my Linux box, the clock always is 1
hour behind what it should be.  Any time I reset the time, it changes
the next time I reboot.  I presume there is some config file somewhere
telling it to do that but I have no idea where or what (and it was also
exhibiting the same behavior before I was networked).  Anyone have any
solutions or suggestions?  I'd appreciate them!

Well, I have a Archive 8 GIG 4mm DAT drive in my machine running off of a 
sound-blaster SCSI card along with a 1.7 Gig SCSI HD, and a NEC 3XI 
CD-ROM.  I have cron backing up the complete drives (SCSI and 211 Meg 
IDE) every night.  I get backup speeds of about 25 Megs a minute, and 
compare times of about 36-39 megs a minute.  Overall, I have to say I 
love the drive.  I think it is MUCH more reliable than the Exabyte drives 
I have worked with before.  Also a lot cheaper.  E-Mail me if you need 
any more information

Happy Linux'ing

Hi,

   I'm trying to use ghostscript so that my humble DeskJet 500 can
emulate a spiffy PostScript printer.  I'm invoking gs like this:

gs -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=deskjet -sPAPERSIZE=a4 -r300 -sOutputFile=/dev/lp1 -

  The output is at the end of this posting.  What I'm really trying to
do is make it so that I can print out *NICE* documents on my deskjet.
I want to change the font & font size so that I can fit more on one
page then in the standard 12pt (10pt?) courier.  I'd also like to
print more than one 'page' on each physical page.   Does anyone
have any suggestions?

peace,  Ben

Ok, I've kind of seen it discussed here, but still don't understand it.
My service provider has given me three ip numbers, and I have three
machines on a local, private ethernet (two linux boxes and an alpha).  
One of the linux boxes is connected via ppp to my service provider, and
by extension the rest of the internet.  The other two machines can connect
to my linux box, but thye can't get out to the internet.  What is the
easiest way to get my machine to act as a router?

XFree86 3.0's been out for Linux too; i've been using it for a coupla
months now.

you probably mean an "official" release.  yes, 3.0's beta. 3.1 will
be the "real" thing.

you have XFree 2.1.1.  i promise, there's no big difference.  the biggest
difference to me will be LBX, which means i can run stuff at a pretty
good speed via a PPP modem link.  

actually, there's no noticible difference at all, 'cept it's less
flexible (no linkkit, so i can't get a smaller binary. )

Subject: Xfree86 Config Prob.
Date: Thu, 22 Sep 1994 23:07:49 GMT

I have a problem when I run ConfigXF86 to configure Xfree86
for Slackware. I seem to be able to configure ok for my ATI
graphics ultra and Viewsonic 7 monitor but when I run Tune
then I have some trouble.It tells me something about flickering
and then when I tell it to proceed I see some error msgs flash
up which are then erased as the screen is cleared. It tries to tell
me what modes are available but gives a msg something like ,"
cat /tmp/1541.tmm no such file or directory" I should mention
that after installing Linux I then added one user w/associated
home directory. I ran the config script from the user login. 
I did not mark any particular directories as readable by that user.
   I also tried modifying the config script so that it would run
from the root login but I did not get any further than from
my user login.
   My Xfree installation did not have any problems that I know
of. I chose mach8 as the shell for my graphics ultra.
   Any ideas?
   Thanks,
   Joe

I just completed that very task.  There is a kernel image called SCSI-NET 
that has several network card drivers built into it.  I was able to boot 
a DOS based 386-25 with a 3Com 3C509 and was able to install via NFS from 
a 486-33 running Linux (1.1.47, 3.016 net code).

The first few steps for creating the partition, formatting the drive etc 
are the same as a normal install.  When you get to the "select source" 
choose NFS.  SETUP then asks for your IP, mask, gateway (I didn't use 
one), NFS host, net and broadcast addresses.  You will have to exec the 
portmap utility BEFORE you run setup.  There was a screen that popped up 
that mentioned several steps that had to performed before SETUP was started.

This install was done with the InfoMagic June '94 release using Slakware 2.0.

Hope this helps...

I was wondering howto improve the transfert speed to/from my tape backup.
I need to backup the server and a notebook.

I consider buying one of the adapter card from colorado.

Is it worthed and supported under linux? (I know somes are)
Do Linux support hardware compression?

Here is my system configuration:
486DX50 EISA w/20MB RAM
Adaptec 1742A
Quantum 525LPS HDD
NEC CDR84J cdrom
ATIXL w/mouse w/o monitor! (long story...)
Colorado jumbo250MB (of course!)

Talking about 'no monitor', is there somebody working on a 'something' 
that would permit me (or anybody) to read tapes mades with TAPE.EXE or 
CBWLITE.EXE with and without compression.

I need something that would be available thru the lan.

I was thinking also at the dosemu and wine but none of them seem to allow 
me to access my tape drive.

any suggestion accepted.

Be careful to differentiate between "music" and "sound"; i.e. adrenalin-
pumping music vs. the wonderful sound of an imp's guts falling to the floor
as he gets nailed by the blast of a rocket launcher.  Unless ID cranked out
another release, I believe linuxxdoom only supports sound, NOT music (at least
that's all I've been able to get out of it with my 8-bit SBPro and the 16-to-8
thing).

There is a removepkg command, if you want to be sure.
It's a bit painful, as you have to list all the packages (.tgz files)
you want to remove.

Subject: Networking Problems (Still)
Date: 24 Sep 1994 21:03:36 GMT

Hello Again.

I am still having alot of problems with my slip connection working right.
Actually, as I said in a previous post (and thanks to those who responded),
I think it is only one problem: I can't see myself!  

Before I start, here is the setup:
Linux ver. 1.0.9 (from the SW CD)
dip ver. 3.3.7-uri (24 May 94)
connecting to the UF Annex (running SunOs but thats not the problem)

When I first start up the machine (actually, before I dial in) I can do a 
'ping localhost' and I get all of my stats no problem.  I can also do an
'rlogin localhost' with no problems.

However, once I slip in to the University, any attempt to ping or
login yeilds:

PING localhost (127.0.0.1): 56 data bytes
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
ping: wrote localhost 64 chars, ret=-1
ping: sendto: Network is unreachable
ping: wrote localhost 64 chars, ret=-1

--- localhost ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

and localhost: Network is unreachable, respectively.

ifconfig yeilds:
lo        Link encap Local Loopback  
          inet addr 127.0.0.1  Bcast 127.255.255.255  Mask 255.0.0.0

          RX packets 4225 errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 3585
          TX packets 6779 errors 0 dropped 33 overruns 5629

(The low MTU for slip is normal (UF requires it))

route yields:

Wrong again.

The confusion relates to the fact that DOS, unlike Linux, assigns
device names dynamically.  There are three standard addresses for the
printer ports: 0x3bc, 0x378 and 0x278.  If you have all three, they
are LPT1, LPT2 and LPT3 under DOS and lp0, lp1 and lp2 under Linux.
However, many systems ship with the first printer port on 0x378.  If
you have 0x378 and 0x278, they are LPT1 and LPT2 under DOS, but still
lp1 and lp2 under Linux.

Hence, LPT1 can be either lp0 or lp1 under Linux, depending on how
your system is configured.

I have Slackware 2.0 and was also unable to get PPP to work.  I have
heard that the version of PPP in Slackware 2.0 will not work.  I got a
new version of PPP from sunsite and installed that and it worked fine.

The installation I did was to compile chat and pppd and put the ppp.c
and ppp.h files into the kernel source and recompile the kernel.

The binary you downloaded has Motif libraries statically linked in it. You
have to purchase Motif if you want either to rebuild it from the source or
to run a shared-lib (thus smaller) version of the executable.

Wise decision : the developers themselves stated that XFree86 3.0 for Linux
was so "pre-release"ish that for vanilla use your best bet was to keep
the 2.1* version till 3.1 comes out.

This is completely obsolete. The current VoxWare sound driver is included
in the standard kernel source tree. It has a README in it that should
enlight you about Sound and Linux :-)

This is no real solution, but you may try to kill lpd and restart it after
you've powered your printer up. Works here, anyway (I suspect lpd fails to
work correctly if the printer is not online when it starts up, but I've
had no time to find out the problem precisely. It seems that /tmp/.printer
sometimes disappears, but I'm not sure...)

Hope this helps :-)
