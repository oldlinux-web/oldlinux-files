The author is in Germany. They don't have software patents in germany like
most of the world. Someone might cop it for using it in the USA however.

Assuming you actually get one it logs the NMI with a warning you may have
bad ram. Most problems with modern ram are not caught by parity errors
however.

I don't think that's the problem, cause it works on my drive which has 19xx
cylinders. Linux gives me a warning about the high cylinder number tho.

The disk I'm using is a 2GB HP connected to a Buslogic 747.

It's due to caching problems.  This is bound to happen to some extent or
other as the ratio of cache to main memory falls but if it is significant, it
is usually caused by a duff motherboard.  Make sure you have a 256K of cache
and you should be fine.  I've got 20M and I've no problems.

OTOH, it is not a good idea to include /usr/src/linux/include/config.h
in an application program...
Apparently the application depends on configuration details of the kernel,
but those can change without the application knowing about it!

The FAQ says:

   Question 6.9. When I add more memory it slows to a crawl.

   This is quite a common symptom of a failure to cache the additional
   memory. The exact problem depends on your motherboard.

   Sometimes you have to enable caching of certain regions in your BIOS
   setup. Look in the CMOS setup and see if there is an option to cache
   the new memory area which is currently switched off.  This is
   apparently most common on a 486.

   Sometimes the RAMs have to be in certain sockets to be cached.

   Sometimes you have to set jumpers to enable the caching.

   Some motherboards don't cache all the RAM if you have more RAM per
   amount of cache than they expect. Usually a full 256K cache will solve
   this problem.

   If in doubt, check your motherboard manual. If you still can't fix it
   because the documentation is inadequate you might like to post a
   message giving *all* the details - make, model number, date code,
   etc. so that other Linux users can avoid it.

<Flam-bait follows!>
First, please excuse my language - English is my second language,
Norwegian is my first.

Now, I would never (or at least not for some years) recommend Linux to
my customers as an alternative to MS-DOS or OS/2, especially not when
we are talking about networks and day-to-day use of business programs.

1. There is no support for the more sofisticated disk handlings like
   RAID 5 or STRIPING.

2. There are no programs available that does Word-processing, spreadsheets,
   databases, presentation graphics and so on, as we have under MS-DOS
   and Windows.

3. There is currently no easy way to interconnect to LAN Server or Netware
   natively, i.e.  from Linux.

4. There is no support for MCA-based machines.

5. There is no support for Token-Ring (some ALPHA code is floating around
   on the Net, but....)

6. Nationalized version of the few programs existing are not available.

7. Nationalized versions of Linux is not available.

8. Support for modern graphics accelerators like Mach64, Stealth64 etc, 
   is not scheduled until maybe next year.

9. Printed manuals and easy 'Get started' manuals does not exist.

10. Support for Mulit-media is shaky.

11. Support for ISDN is not generally available.

12. There is no disk-compression.

I do have more points, but I think this is enough. 
Personally, I think Linux is great and I'm runnig it on one of my disks,
but I also run MS-DOS and WfW 3.11 and OS/2 WARP2 BETA, OS/2 2.11, all
except WARP2 in native language.

When I'm recommending some system to my customers it should be something 
that has a proven record of durability, Netware and Lan Server both have 
that when it comes to NOS'es. MS-DOS and OS/2 have it when it comes to
PC OS'es.

My customers are like all other customers, they will use wordprocessors,
spreadsheets and so on. They are now used to be able to see the same thing
on the screen as they will get on the paper. They need to import data
from a wide range of other products, read MAC disks etc.

In a network environment, things like RAID 5 and STRIPING both adds to
security and speed. 

When it comes to TokenRing and MCA based machines, well IBM is the
biggest player in the computer world no matter what you people of the
.edu thinks!

What amazes me, is that there are so few from the commercial world in
this fora, only from the academic world. Maybe I should take that as
a sign telling me that this is of purely academic interest at the
moment.

Now gentlemen, it's up to YOU!

The GNU license and the FSF are two totally unrelated things. I think bits of
the FSF politics is a bit but the GPL achieves exactly what I want - and
doesn't in anyway do away with property rights.

Hello,

I recently installed inn.1.4. on my Linux system as it was distributed
with the Slackware 2.0 version. First of all it seems to work fine. But
sometimes, when I want to read news with winvn or telnet on port 119,
I'm getting the message: "innd server can't talk to you"
When I'm looking in the syslog file, I see the following message:
"nntp[]: access: fopen /usr/lib/news/nntp/nntp_access : No such file or 
directory.
This is correct I don't have this file, in fact I never had it.
The workaround is, that I have to shutdown and restart inn.

I tried to post this question on news.software.nntp, but I did not get
any satisfactory answers.

Can somebody tell me what is wrong ..

Thanks in advance,

greetings
Andre Addicks.

This is not a problem, because the language which is converted to 
machine code is C and not Fortran. And gcc supports the 80 bit format,
via the standard C type 'long double'.

Other posters have pointed out the real problem: such an implementation
is non-standard and the compiler itself would need changes, to be aware
of the fact that the size of a DOUBLE PRECISION variable is not twice
the size of a REAL variable, as required by the language definition.

I know exactly why it's happening.  The 486SLC doesn't have a math coprocessor.

I don't know if it was the same thing, but in the latest Open Systems Today

One nice point he made is comparing the slowness of major developers in gettting
