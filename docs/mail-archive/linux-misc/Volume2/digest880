   Not true.  Running a billion dollar company is more complex that
   you paint it.

But he shows no interest in opposing the 800lb gorilla.  In fact, he's
even trying to appease it.  Yeah, like yr gonna run a NetWare server

Maybe RTFM-ing some more would'ave helped - here's how you could'ave
done it...

# echo "netmask 0xffffff80" > /etc/config/ifconfig-1.options

Linux is very good - but not good enough yet to build a "corporate 
network". From my .sig you'll see that I'm somewhat biased - just FYI 
before flaming me - I'm running a large network of SGI machines, I've run 
large networks of Suns, VAXes and Macs - but I've also recommended and 
installed Dell Pentiums + Slackware to friends who needed enough bang but 
didn't have the bucks. Actually, I log in to and use one almost daily. 
*Very* nice indeed - five people on? Don't notice each other. Dead stable
too (last downtime was planned - and note time before load average...):

hal:~$ w
  3:37am  up 14 days, 12:44,  6 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.01, 0.01

It'd make me throw out my PS/2 with Windows any day but you'll never ever
see me swapping my Indy for it (DOOM runs well on SGIs too so... :-)

Hi all,

I would like to know if it is possible that Lilo will boot the last booted
OS. E.g. if I boot Linux then Lilo will keep on booting linux 'till I select
another OS (MS-Dos). I liked this feature in the SLS distribution (0.99.X),
but it is gone in the slackware distribution.

Suggestions anyone?
Thanks in advance.

As with most things in AUIS, its only a matter of knowing.  Akex, if you
want to contact me directly, I have some pointers to what needs to be
changed.  Maybe between us we can work this out and distribute AUIS
which can print in all sorts of fonts. Looking forward to working with

Subject: diamond stealth status?
From: Karl Rudnick <khr@trg.saic.com>
Date: Tue, 04 Oct 1994 21:48:35 GMT

Hi

I'm new to this newsgroup and am contemplating a linux installation. 
I have a question regarding my video card, Diamond Stealth VRAM. I
noticed in the How-To that this card is not supported by XFree86. I
presume there is some commercial reason here? (pardon my naivete if
this has been extensively discussed before).

Presumably, I have 3 alternatives:

    1. Obtain an XFree86 driver from somewhere(one) else. Does one
       even exist?

    2. Get a commercial X-Server package which supports my card and
       works with linux.

    3. Trash my card and get a new one (about the same cost as 2?).

I would appreciate any enlightenment, especially from someone who
went through the same experience as I am about to undertake.

Karl

   Hurd, maybe? Are they planning an 486 version at all?

The initial target for the Hurd is 803+86 machines (and others have
been added to the list: AXP, PowerPC, etc).

Contrary to popular belief, this kind of questions don't belong to
this group (or any other Linux group). There is a special group,
dedicated to XFree86 and named comp.windows.x.i386unix.

I'm pretty sure you can get a cheaper supported card than a commercial
X server. And I've never heard of commercial servers for Linux. I guess
nobody dared to face the competition of XFree86 :-)

     4. Wait. From the recent announcement of XFree86 3.1:

NOTE: The Diamond SpeedStar 24 (and possibly recent SpeedStar+) boards are
      NOT supported, even though they use the ET4000.  The Stealth 32
      which uses the ET4000/W32p is also not supported.  Historically
      the information required for this support was only available
      under non-disclosure.  As of September 27, 1994, Diamond has
      verbally agreed to provide The XFree86 Project, Inc. with
      detailed information about Diamond products.  This should permit
      us to better support these in future versions of XFree86.

need to manually tell the kernel what's where on rebooring after this.

It's actually worse than that. When you split into new groups people start
posting new questions into those groups without regard for the title or
the charter of the group. c.o.l.help is for questions, yet all the other
groups have a bunch of questions posted into them.

The bottom line is that we're being overwhelmed by loads of information:
mostly FAQs, dozens of responses to the same question, and posts in
inappropriate places. New groups will not solve the problem because they'll
simply provide "new clean cultures for bacteria to grow".

The solution in my opinion is three-fold:

1) Don't create a whole bunch of new groups.
2) Make all new groups moderated.
3) Collapse admin into misc because they're not very much different anyway.

Obviously the load of new group is too much for a human moderator to handle.
So the groups should be moderated in the following manner.

1) Program moderated. The program moderator enforces keywords and reading of
   the documentation. Reject posts that do not fit the criteria possibly
   sending appropriate snippets of the documentation to help the poster
   along. Remember that posting to a moderated newsgroup opens the door
   to an E-mail response.
2) Posting responses into the group should be limited. Only one correct answer
   need be posted in response to a question , not 10.
3) FAQ's, HOW-TO's, guides, and any other documentation should be posted in
   appropriate groups regularly and with long expires.
4) Continue the excellent idea of making Linux documentation available over
   E-mail, ftp, and WWW. Encourage people to read the docs.

Lastly leave a few unmoderated groups available. I'd personally belive that
development, help, and misc is enough.

This is an instance where information overload is clogging up the ability to
transfer relavent information back in forth in a resonable manner.

Comments?
