The other point to remember is that some BIOSes think (for reasons
best known to themselves) that you might not want to cache all your
RAM.  If you have one of these, you have to make sure that you have
told the BIOS to cache all your RAM and not just the first part.  (AMI
is like this, as I found out the hard way a while ago.)

Well put, although not _entirely_ accurate, but in essence, correct.
Some bios (AMI, as an example) allow you to determine how much RAM
to cache. Some don't (Bummer).

Also, alot of hardware designs have very lousey design for DMA above
16 Megs, (read that as: if it's a 386 or if its a mature 486, don't
expect DMA above 16 Megs.) Most high speed I/O may want to use
DMA to memory rather than the old 'Test-n-Transfer' mode. (This
applies to the BIOS drivers for floppies {Yes, floppies} and 
hard drives.)

The Pentium grade machines and some of the later '486 designs now
allow DMA above 16 Megs. Cache for these machines are larger in
size and allow cache'ng for more than 16 Meg ram.

Subject: howto use telnet/ftp under term?
Date: 23 Sep 1994 16:25:50 GMT

Dear netters

Could some kind soul please explain 'term' to me?

I have managed to build and run term ver. 2.1.1, and I am able to
telnet from my local machine to a remote machine on campus. I do the
following:

tredir 2023 remotehost.ucs.edu:23
telnet localhost 2023

this will give me a telnet session on the remote host! good, but what
if I want to telnet to another host? Same questions regarding ftp.

What is the difference between

'tredir 2023 remotehost.ucsb.edu:23' and
'tredir 2023 23' ?

How do I use a name server ? can I use 'tredir 2042 nameserver:42' ?

I would like to run mosaic from home, I tried to run mosaic on the
remote computer using txconn, and that worked, but running an x-server
over a 14.400 modem is not exactly flying. I know that this is a little
premature, since I have not ftp'ed mosaic yet (I can't ftp to
ncsa... yet, you know) what do I need to get mosaic to work with term?
Which docs are a good starting point ?

I think my problems stem from the fact that I don't fully understand
'term'. I have tried to read the README, INSTALL, term.HOWTO, and the
tcp/ip chapter in "Essential System Administration". If some of you
could try explain term or answer my concrete problems I will be very
great-full. Any pointer to further docs on term are also appreciated.

sincerely Lars L. Madsen

Well, there probably won't be. MCA is a joke. Newer designs exist that
give more throughput (local bus, for example) than MCA ever did. Besides,
the support for MCA, even in the DOS or hardware arena, is rather minimal.
MCA-based cards are a rarity. Apart from the extant MCA-based computers,

This is fairly easy. There is no need for a HOWTO.

Since you are asking how to setup a modem . . . .

Make sure that the modems present the proper status of DCD, CTS, and
DSR. Ensure that the modems honor DTR and RTS. Don't use a cheap
cable which does not pass these signals.

Now, if you wanted to know how to setup PPP for use . . .

Read the files README and README.linux in the source package. If you
have questions about specific sections in the documentation, I'll be
happy to answer them.

Please quote the section that you don't understand so that I know what
must be changed.

The documentation in the PPP is not designed to be an all-encompassing
PPP document. Nor is it meant to be the general discussion on how to
set up your network configuration. There are other documents for
those.

The README file is generated by the package author, Paul
Mackerras. The README.linux file is brought to you by the linux PPP
working group.

You will find additional information in the Networking Admin Guide and
the NET-2-HOWTO. Please look there as well.

I am sorry to simply say RTFM, but, in the case of "gee, I just was
using vt100 terminal connections and I would like to use PPP. How do I
do it?" is too broad of a question to answer specifically. So, please
Read The Fine Manuals. A great deal of time was put into writing them.

This doesn't belong here, really, but hey, neither did the above article.

The Compaq name tag buys you one thing that *could* be worth the money.

Customer service.

I bought a used Compaq 386DX20.  Old machine when I bought it, extremely
expensive when it was new, I'm sure.  After I'd had it a year or two,
I wanted to install a 3.5 inch drive.  Bought one, and the durn thing
would work.  Took it back, got another, and it wouldn't work.

Called Compaq customer service.  The guy on the other side of the phone
was *extremely* helpful, and further, he *overnighted*, at no cost to
me, Compaq installation disks, a manual, and some other PC programs by
Compaq.

That little trick bought them a friend for life.  I piece together my
own systems now, but I'll recommend Compaq to people who want a good
system and can afford a little extra for it.

Someone mailed me and said that the PCI bus on my pentium system
is 32 bits and capable of 132 Mb/sec. 

This may well be correct and the PCI bus is probably what we are
talking about.

However, I'm primarily concerned about the bandwidth of the onboard DRAM.
This IS 64 bits wide and is interleaved in two-bank blocks.
Does any one know if there is a separate bus for the DRAM?

I did some benchmarks some time ago that seemed
to indicate more then 200 Mb/s but I could have f**ked someting up ... 
(like not using enough working set size to trick the cache ...)

actually we bought the software (insightII and ...) from BIOSYM, with it
came the machine for a price of Dfl 20.000,= (US$ 12000,=).
the system has no c-compiler and I can go on like this for a minute.

Running insightII is the biggest dissaster happening to you...

Ok the demo which was installed was alright, but this machine is in practice
a failure....

He your email adress is not valid! Ever tried to set up some intelligent
networking (e.g. sub netting) from within the sysadmin X program on a Indy?
it doesn't work. So I had to use a normal xterm and vi and some tough hacking
in those over 500 lines long corrupted scripts (My Linux experience helped
me out) to get it going...IRIX is certainly not my favorit UNIX...

Subject: Sound problems and others
Date: Fri, 23 Sep 1994 02:43:23 GMT

I have two problems/questions:
First, the easy (or short) one.  When I run top right after a cold reboot, it
shows most of my main memory is being used (less than 600K) free.  I just
recompiled my kernel, I now have version 1.1.50.  Also, I don't know if
this is related, but I was looking in my /var/adm/messages file, and the
kernel had reported several times that bdflush wasn't running.  What is
bdflush?  Any ideas as to what's causing this?  (my system info is at the
end of this letter).

Second, I have a major sound problem.  I've got an SB16, and I'm using version
2.9 patch2 of the sound driver.  Anyway, whenever I try to play anything that
has 16-bit sound, my computer either locks up, reboots, or the kernel panics.
This happens for things like DOOM and when I try to play MODs at 16-bits with
s3mod. Here is the debugging output from the latest panic (this is after
running X, compiling a few programs, and playing a few MODs at 8-bits):

Ooops: 0000

              -not syncing

Here's my setup:
AMD 386dx40
Math coproc (forget name)
SB16 Basic w/ ASP chip
Turtle Beach Rio waveblaster daughterboard
ATI Graphics Wonder 1meg ISA video card
AMI bios
1 seagate 120 meg IDE hard drive
1 Western Digital 420 meg IDE hard drive
8 megs of RAM (8 1-meg 30 pin SIMMS -- 70ns)]
Zoom faxmodem installed on COM2  14.4 kbps
MS mouse 2.0 on COM1

I have no problems with 16-bit sound under DOS, BTW.

Also, does anyone out there know of a MIDI player for linux that'll use
the Rio daughterboard?

Thanks in advance,

I found different results.  A few months ago, when I was playing with
an mpeg decoder, I regularly saw 10-15% faster results with 2.4.0p.
YMMV.
