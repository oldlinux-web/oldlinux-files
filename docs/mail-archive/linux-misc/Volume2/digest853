I'm having something kind of strange with certain cron jobs.  I've
got a number of entries in my personal crontab to send me email as
a reminder to do various things.  What is weird is that although I
explicitly specify 'MAILTO=' in my crontab, certain job seem to cause
me to get email anyway.  The only common thing I've noticed is that
the reminder jobs are set up like the following:

0 15 * * Sat echo xxx | mail -s 'Do incremental backup' dswartz

Could the pipe be causing problems?  I'd added the 'xxx' to the
echo command to avoid the silly 'Empty message body' warning,
figuring that might be causing it.  Nope.  I'm about on the verge
of adding a mail alias for 'devnull' specifying the bit-bucket,
and adding that to all of the MAILTO directives.  Can anyone shed
light on this?

It's in, it should work. You'll need the ifslave program to try it out

Subject: New Linux Distribution
Date: 28 Sep 1994 06:00:03 -0400

I have been thinking of putting up a new Linux distribution especially
oriented to DOS-Win dummies. I have taken a nontraditional approach and
am willing to sacrifice many of the sacred cows of Unix. I really think 
that many features of traditional unix are not very useful in a typical
home pc context. However, clearly Linux has many advantages over Dos-Win
if care is taken for keeping a reasonably small distribution. That way,
Dos-Win users can discover the power of Linux without feeling overwhelmed.
I'd like to include a short and concise guide that highlights the major
differences between dos-win and Linux-Xfree86, something of the sort of
the book "Unix in a Nutshell" but much shorter. A possible title could be
"Unix (Linux) in a Pinhead: an introduccion to Unix for Dos users" (grin).

My distribution, tentatively called "WIn-dos Transition" (WIT), would have
the following features:
        - Defaults to SINGLE USER mode. No need to show the complications
                of multiuser accounts to newbies who will likely use it
                personally.
        - Only one shell: bash, with lots of aliases that match as closely
                as possible the COMMAND.COM commands and the utilities in
                the DOS directory. Maybe it won't be very difficult to 
                include a .BAT->.sh translator.
        - Only enough utilities to match the functionality of the DOS
                standard utilities plus the major unix winners like 
                grep, awk and sed. (But not vi or emacs!!!).
        - NO NETWORKING, except for maybe a terminal program (minicom) and
                a mostly configured SLIP (client side only). In that case,
                maybe Mosaic should be also included.
        -NO SCSI. Most home dos-win users don't even know what SCSI is.
        -XFree 3.1 configured to use the VGA16 server (mono or color) with
                a generic (low resolution) Xconfig.
        - Utilities to match the standard Windows applets:
                Winfile -> Xfm-1.3
                Progman -> Xfm-1.3
                Notepad -> Axe (?)
                Write   -> Ez
                Terminal -> Minicom (Seyon?)
                Mediaplay -> ?????
                Dos windows -> Xterm,rxvt (of course !!!)
                Whatelse??? 
        - Only one window manager: FVWM
        - No developing tools.
        - The binaries should fit (gzipped) in 10 1.44 floppies.

The idea is that this will not be the final Linux distribution that 
the users will have, but only a "transitional" distribution that lets
them get the feeling of the power of Linux in an environment as much familiar
to them as possible. Therefore, the distribution will be compatible with
Slackware "packages", so that an upgrade (when the fear is left behind) will
be very smooth.

Well, that's my idea. I'd like to hear comments before I start packaging 
everything, because if you think this is useless I'd like to know before
I waste my time. All suggestions will be appreciated.

No, look at the first line. It's sys_reboot(). You have to give it a magic
number in order to reboot the system. This is to prevent, for example, 
people from calling sys_reboot without knowing what they're doing, or, 
say, a stack-squasher which causes sys_reboot() to be called accidentally. 

I don't know of any backdoors in the Linux kernel, except, of
course, the one where logging in with the username "linus" causes
the machine to hang.

Subject: A couple simple questions
Date: Thu, 29 Sep 1994 14:36:03 GMT

Hi.

I'm just getting into Linux, and liking it a whole lot. I just have a few 
problems so far I was wondering if anyone could help me with.

I printed once.  No CR.  I tried changing some of the printcap around, no 
luck.  I changed it back.  Now, when I lpd something, all I get are blank 
pages.  I'm currently using the generic printer entry.  I have a Laserjet 
4ML.

Secondly, I can't receive files over the modem with minicom.  The blue 
receive box comes up, pauses for a bit, then dissapears.  If I use xmodem 
and switch to a shell to run rz -vv I get the error that it can't open 
/var/adm/szlog.  I made a dummy szlog, and even changed the group 
ownership from root to users, but no luck.

Can anyone give me some pointers to help, or any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,
nathan

They're planning to release a new version as soon as there are new, stable
versions of the kernel (I guess 1.2), gcc (2.6.x), the libraries (4.6.x) and
XFree (3.1).  They should all happen reasonably soon, so some time after
that we can expect the next version.

As far as I know, the EE32 and the later versions of the NE3200 are identical.

And then, the AC3200 driver should also work with the Mylex LNE390, the Eagle

The only difference from model to model is the table that translates the
config byte at slot+0C90 into the shared memory and interrupt selection

I saved this from some old post (but have never tried it ...):

[ Tierra is an artificial life and evolution simulator for various

If you have SLS you can get Tierra going just by uncommenting the

someone with a math coprocessor). Then type

make programs

and it works.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.

Hmm, I uploaded a Mosaic with term and direct wais support to sunsite last

Both are compiled to work with both term and normal TCP link using the

various foreign languages.

(I also have a beta Lynx 2.3.3 beta with term and direct wais support if
