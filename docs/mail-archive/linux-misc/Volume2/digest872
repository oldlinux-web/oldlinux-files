1 - What is XFree86?
====================
  XFree86 is a added-value package for X11R6 that supports several versions
of Intel-based Unix and Unix-like operating systems.  XFree86-3.0 was
part of the X11R6 core distribution.  This release XFree86-3.1 consists of
many new features and performance improvements as well as many bug fixes.
The release is available as source patches against the X Consortium X11R6
code, as well as binary distributions for many architectures.


2 - What's new in XFree86 3.1?
==============================
  The following items have been added since XFree86 2.1.1 was released in
May 1994:

    1) XFree86 is now based on X11R6, including shared library support for
       SVR4, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.
    2) New configuration file format.  One of the biggest changes that you
       will notice with the new XFree86 version is that the old Xconfig
       file has been replaced by an XF86Config file.  For further details,
       see the `Important Changes' section below.
    3) Support is included for the X Image Extension (XIE).
    4) A new accelerated server for boards based on the Weitek P9000

    8514/A (and true clones)
    ATI Mach8, Mach32
    Cirrus CLGD5420, CLGD5422, CLGD5424, CLGD5426, CLGD5428, CLGD5429,
           CLGD5430, CLGD5434, CLGD6205, CLGD6215, CLGD6225, CLGD6235
    S3 86C911, 86C924, 86C801, 86C805, 86C805i, 86C928, 86C864, 86C964
    Western Digital WD90C31, WD90C33

    IIT AGX-014, AGX-015, AGX-016
    Tseng ET4000/W32, ET4000/W32i, ET4000/W32p

The Cirrus and Western Digital accelerators are supported in the SVGA
server; the other chipsets each have their own server.  A list of some
cards which the accelerated servers have been tested with is included in the
files AccelCards, Devices, and some of the chipset-specific README files.
They may well work on other cards, but we cannot guarantee it.
  
In addition, the following SVGA chipsets are supported:
    
    Tseng ET3000, ET4000AX, ET4000/W32
    Western Digital/Paradise PVGA1
    Western Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11, WD90C24, WD90C30, WD90C31,
                    WD90C33
    Genoa GVGA
    Trident TVGA8800CS, TVGA8900B, TVGA8900C, TVGA8900CL, TVGA9000,
            TVGA9000i, TVGA9100B, TVGA9200CX, TVGA9320, TVGA9400CX, TVGA9420
    ATI 18800, 18800-1, 28800-2, 28800-4, 28800-5, 28800-6, 68800-3,
        68800-6, 68800AX, 68800LX, 88800
    NCR 77C22, 77C22E, 77C22E+
    Cirrus Logic CLGD5420, CLGD5422, CLGD5424, CLGD5426, CLGD5428,
                 CLGD5429, CLGD5430, CLGD5434, CLGD6205, CLGD6215,
                 CLGD6225, CLGD6235, CLGD6420
    Compaq AVGA
    OAK OTI067, OTI077
    Advance Logic AL2101
    MX MX68000, MX680010
    Video 7/Headland Technologies HT216-32
    
All of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes, with
the exception of the Advance Logic, MX and Video 7 chipsets, which are only
supported in 256 color mode.

Refer to the chipset-specific README files (currently for Cirrus, Tseng,
Western Digital, ATI, Trident and Video 7) for more information about using
those chipsets.

The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of video
memory in a single bank, the Hercules monochrome card, the Hyundai HGC1280,
Sigma LaserView, and Apollo monochrome cards.  On the Compaq AVGA, only
64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome server, and the GVGA has
not been tested with more than 64k.

The VGA16 server supports memory banking with the ET4000, Trident, ATI,
NCR, OAK and Cirrus 6420 chipsets allowing virtual display sizes up to
about 1600x1200 (with 1MB of video memory).  For other chipsets the display
size is limited to approximately 800x600.

NOTE: The Diamond SpeedStar 24 (and possibly recent SpeedStar+) boards are
      NOT supported, even though they use the ET4000.  The Stealth 32 which
      uses the ET4000/W32p is also not supported.  Historically the
      information required for this support was only available under
      non-disclosure.  As of September 27, 1994, Diamond has verbally
      agreed to provide The XFree86 Project, Inc. with detailed information
      about Diamond products.  This should permit us to better support
      these in future versions of XFree86.


5 - Important Changes
=====================
  There are a number of important user-visible changes between
XFree86 2.1.1 and XFree86 3.1.  The first is the default install location.
The XFree86 distribution is now installed by default under /usr/X11R6
instead of /usr/X386.  This moves away from the now out-dated "X386" name,
and it also makes it possible for both versions to co-exist.

The next major change is related to the server configuration file.  The old
Xconfig file has been replaced in XFree86 3.1 by an XF86Config file.  This
is more than just a name change.  The new XF86Config file uses a format
that is quite different from the old Xconfig file.  The new format is more
structured, logical, and extensible than the old format.  We realise that
the transition to this new format won't be without problems.  To help in
this transition we have provided a program (`reconfig') to convert the old
Xconfig format into the new XF86Config format.  This doesn't provide a
perfect conversion mostly because the new format contains more information
than the old format.  Some manual editing will always be required.  One of
the new types of information the XF86Config contains is a description of
the monitor(s) you are using.  This addition allows the servers to check
that the video modes are within the specifications of the monitor.

For information about the new config file format and how to use it, refer
to the XF86Config(4/5) and reconfig(1) manual pages, and the README.Config
file which can be found in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc.

Another change related to the config file is the locations the servers look
for it in.  In previous releases the servers would look in places which
could be specified by the user.  This raised a number of security concerns.
To address these, the server now only looks in places which are normally
under the control of the system administrator.  For further details, refer
to the XFree86(1) manual page.


6 - Where to get more information
=================================
  Additional documentation is available in the XFree86(1), XF86Config(4/5),
XF86_SVGA(1), XF86_Mono(1), XF86_VGA16(1) and XF86_Accel(1) manual pages.
In addition, several README files and tutorial documents are provided.
These are available in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc in the binary distributions,
and in xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/doc in the source distribution.

The files README.Config and VideoModes.doc should be consulted for
information on how to set up the XFree86 servers.  All supplied documents
and manual pages should be read before contacting the XFree86 team for
assistance.

Documentation on SVGA driver development can be found in the directory
/usr/X11R6/lib/Server/VGADriverDoc in the binary distribution, and in the
directory xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/VGADriverDoc in the source
distribution.

If you are totally at a loss, you can contact the XFree86 Core Team at
the electronic mail address below.

There is a Usenet news group comp.windows.x.i386unix that contains
mostly discussions about XFree86 and related topics. Many questions can
be answered there. The answers to common questions are found in the
corresponding FAQ.

=======================
Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86
Core Team.  At this time the Core Team consists of (in alphabetical order):

       David Wexelblat <dwex@XFree86.org>

Mail sent to <Core@XFree86.org> will reach the core team.

9 - The XFree86 Project, Inc.
=============================
The XFree86 Project, Inc, has been founded to accomplish two major goals:

        1) To provide a vehicle by which XFree86 can be represented in
           X Consortium, Inc, the organization responsible for the
           design, development, and release of The X Window System.
        2) To provide some basic funding for acquisition of facilities for
           ongoing XFree86 development, largly to consist of new video
           hardware and basic computing facilities.

The first of these was the primary motivation.  We have held discussions
with the X Consortium on and off for many months, attempting to find an
avenue by which our loosely-organized free software project could be
given a voice within the X Consortium.  The bylaws of the Consortium
would not recognize such an organization.  After an initial investigation
about funding, we decided to form our own corporation to provide the
avenue we needed to meet the requirements of the X Consortium bylaws.

By doing this, we were able to be involved in the beta-test interval for
X11R6, and have contributed the majority of XFree86 to the X11R6 core
release.  The version of XFree86 in the X11R6 core is 3.0.  As time goes
on, XFree86 will be involved with more of the development of The X Window
System, as a full Consortium member.  How exactly this will evolve is still
being determined.

An additional benefit of this incorporation is that The XFree86 Project,
Inc has obtained outside financial support for our work.  This will
hopefully give us the freedom to be more proactive in obtaining new
video hardware, and enable us to release better products more quickly,
as we will be able to go and get what we need, and get it into the hands
of the people who can do the work.

The initial Board of Directors and Officers of the The XFree86 Project,
Inc, are:

       David Dawes, Secretary
       Dirk Hohndel, Vice-President
       Glenn Lai, Director
       Rich Murphey, Treasurer
       Jim Tsillas, Director
       Jon Tombs, Director
       David Wexelblat, President

       Email to <BOD@XFree86.org> reaches the board of directors.
       
Our bylaws have been crafted in such a way to ensure that XFree86 is and
always will be a free software project.  There is no personal financial
benefit to any member of the Core Team or any other XFree86 participant.
All assets of the corporation remain with the corporation, and, in the
event of the dissolution of the corporation, all assets will be turned over
to the X Consortium, Inc.  It is hoped that by doing this, our corporation
will be merely a formalization of what we have been doing in the past,
rather than something entirely new.

Here is a list of the organizations and individuals who have provided
sponsorship to The XFree86 Project, Inc, either by financial contribution
or by the donation of equipment and resources.  The XFree86 Project, Inc
gratefully acknowledges these contributions, and hopes that we can do
justice to them by continuing to release high-quality free software for
the betterment of the Internet community as a whole.

        UUNET Communications Services, Inc.

UUNET Communications Services, Inc, deserves special mention.  This
organization stepped forward and contributed the entire 1994 X Consortium
membership fee on a moment's notice.  This single act ensured XFree86's
involvement in X11R6.
