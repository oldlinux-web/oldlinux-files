Hi there!  Check out the ppp-2.1.2a collection on sunsite.  It
contains a program, pppd, that you use to manage your PPP connections
as well as a program to called 'chat' to automate your login.
I think its probably lurking somewhere under
/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial on sunsite.unc.edu.

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !

Okay, Okay I should have crossposted it in the first place.
I posted an article under the subject : "Does nobody here know about
Linux ? " in biz.sco.general few hours ago and already have a good
response. This is an honest attempt to convert SCO users to Linux.
Hopefully we'll get attention of some developers and they might think
about porting their popular application to Linux.

If you have been enjoying Linux without paying for it then now is a
good time to pay back to Linux community. Your job is to get more
and more people to start using Linux instead of any other OS. The
more people use Linux, more applications, faster development etc.
etc. Its a good thing you see. Jump to biz.sco.general now and 
participate in that discussion.

I took a linguistics class once, and one of the interesting things I
learned then was the answer to this question.  It's long so I'll summarize.

At one time far in the past the "long" and "short" vowel sounds were
actually long and short versions of the same sounds.  Over time, there
have been many changes in the way English is pronounced, including a
couple massive vowel-shifts, such that none of the vowels are pronounced
today as they were originally pronounced.  Other languages have undergone
similar but different changes.

And how about this:  If I'm installing Linux and I get a query, "Install
blip-oxr, which combines features of blip and oxr?", it would be
helpful if I knew what blip and oxr were.  So a glossary would be
helpful.

Someone new to Linux might have UNIX admin experience, UNIX user
experience, or (like me) no UNIX experience at all.  The installation,
I think, sorta expects the first.  Of course, a Linux user will have to
learn all that stuff but he's got to get installed first...  Actually,
this
might be an argument in favor of the rookie-distribution proposal
discussed in another thread.

It certainly should be. Sunsite's FTP seems to be flaky over the
last few days. You can get the LDP files from tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux
if you can't get sunsite to cooperate.

If you continue to have problems please mail me a log of your FTP session.

I've bought several machines for my school and my friends.  We're very happy
with SWT.  However, I kept seeing people warning others not to order from
SWT because they saw a long article complaining about SWT.  Well, I saw it, 
too.  The only thing impressed me is its length.  And my only comment is that
I wish that guy knows a bit about linux, or even Unix.  I'm only a new user
in Linux.  I also happen to experience same problems like the person did.
Most of the problems can be remedied in minutes, even seconds.  I don't know 
if one should yell out for them.  My only real problem is that SWT forgot
to send me DOS drivers for the parts because I run Linux only on my machine.
One phone call to Marvin solved this.  I got everything I need in one week.
I'm not affiliated with SWT, just a happy user.

It is because they don't have one. Let me see if I can explain further.

The RFC 1332 (and others) defines the IPCP configure request frame to
send the various options to be used in the IP protocol exchange. One
such option is the IP address. The purpose for telling your remote
the IP address is so that it knows the value when it configures its
local routing.

The point-to-point links such as PPP, SLIP, and PLIP, do not use their
own local IP address. There are no routes to that address. All routes
are to the peer's IP address. (This is one of the reasons why you can
not ping your own IP address.)

Each side has the option of sending or not sending their IP
address. It is not a MUST field. (For a definition of the RFC term
MUST, see most any of the RFC documents.)

If you do not know your IP address, you are to send an invalid IP
address to the remote. The invalid address is 0.0.0.0. The remote is
to recognize that this is an invalid address and send a NAK frame for
this field and supply the proper IP address to be used.

The problem is that the RFC does not say what to do if the remote
doesn't know the IP address either. It can't send a NAK and supply the
address of 0.0.0.0 since the protocol requires that the remote then
take this value and send it again on a new configure request frame. It
can't send a IPCP reject frame. This means that it does not wish to do
IP protocol. The only other option is to send an ACK for the frame.

So, when the IPCP protocol is completed, the software looks for the
remote IP address. This is 0.0.0.0. Well, this will not work. So, the
system immediately takes down the IP layer. Since you don't want to
exchange any other protocol but IP at this time, the LCP layer goes
down and the connection is terminated.

There are three solutions to the problem:

1. You may refuse to negotiate the IP addresses. To do this, include
   the option "-ip". This will ignore the IP addresses given by the
   remote and not give your IP address to the remote in your configure
   request frame. You must then include both local and remote IP
   addresses on the pppd execution line.

2. You may give the remote your IP address and refuse to accept
   theirs. This is done with the option "ipcp-accept-local". (What this
   option means is that while you give your address, you are willing to
   accept the remote saying "no, I want you to use address x.x.x.x".)

3. You may specify the remote address and not your own. This will
   request that you get an IP address for your local access from the
   remote system and have an address for the remote to use.

If I was in your situation, I would do option #3.

So, I recommend that you add the following option to the pppd process
execution:

       :10.10.10.10

This will simply give the remote a phoney IP address so that when it
sends you the invalid IP address, you will have something to give it
in response.

You don't have to worry about the address 10.10.10.10 going on the
internet.  Only your local IP address and the final destination IP
address will be used in the frames. It would be difficult for them to
not have a valid IP address for you.

>  Is snarf.com maybe saying "I'll tell you my IP address if you tell
>me your IP address"?

No. It means that they don't know their IP address. This is not a problem.
Just tell them one. :)

Slackware 2.0.1 has a file, LOWMEM.TXT, which describes a couple 
simple workarounds to this problem.  You can get the file from most 
Slackware mirror sites, including 
ftp.cdrom.com:/pub/linux/slackware/LOWMEM.TXT.

Hope it helps -

Subject: TMC-850 on IRQ 11 no workee...
Reply-To: ecarp@netcom.com
Date: Wed, 28 Sep 1994 13:46:21 GMT

I have this really flaky Adaptec 1542B, so I decided to dust off a TMC-850
compatible card and use it.  Since I have a four-port comm card, I decided
to switch the TMC-850 over to IRQ 11.  I changed the IRQ #define in
seagate.c to 11, rebuilt the kernel, and rebooted.  (1.1.51).

The kernel booted, recognized the card as an ST-0X, but recognized my
Maxtor as not only LUN 0, but also LUN4 and 7!  Then it proceeded to
delete some entries (bogus, but it didn't say which ones it was deleting),
and go on. 

The kernel read the partition table OK, but right after it did, it gave me
the message "SCSI error ... id 4 lun 0 rc=27010000", then "I/O error 0810
sector 0, unable to read partition table of dev 0810".  Then the kernel
panicked: "kernel panic: no device passed to allocate_device()".  The root
device is /dev/sda3 (0803).  I have six partitions on this SCSI drive. The
drive itself is a Maxtor 1.2GB HD. 

This same card worked on a pre-1.0 kernel, and it works with the Summer
1994 Yggdrasil kernel. 

The machine is basically down for the moment, since the Adaptec card is
pretty flaky, and I don't have the spare cash to replace it.  Help??

First, I would like to say Thanx to everyone who E-Mailed me with their
suggestions with my SMC Ultra Problem.  I came in one day and it started working
beautifully. I have not had any problems since!

Next, could you tell me how I can get the passwd program to use the /etc/shadow
file. in Slackware 2.0 (? the latest from ftp.cdrom.com) I need this so I 
can be compatable with BSDI which the REST of the school is using.

Also, whoever put together the Slackware Distributions, there is a bug in 
the Ytalk implementation.  It kicks out an error but keeps working after.

Lastly, I KNOW this is the wrong place to post this, but with CNEWS,
How the *&#$@&^* do I allow other machines to use my site's net-news (as well as myself)

Thanx again

Eric
