Subject: [Q] "TMC" PCI54PV Motherboard & 17" CD-1764TR Monitor.
Date: Tue, 6 Sep 1994 07:17:25 GMT

                                                         6 September 1994

Dan Technology plc (London, UK) build their ``dantium/PCi'' Pentium 90MHz
IDE systems using the "TMC" PCI54PV (Version 1.2A) Motherboard.
This PCI motherboard does not have an on-board IDE or SCSI controller.
According to the sample user manual given by Dan, ``the performance, speed
and expandability of the PCI54PV makes it the perfect choice for building
a LAN server, a high-end workstation or a multi-user system.''

I have read the Linux PCI-HOWTO guide, *BUT* I am still very concerned about
the lack of definite information on which PCI/(VLB/)ISA motherboards are
suitable for building a *working* Linux box with a *future*, i.e., not
``buggy'', ``broken'' or ``dead-end''. In particular, the compatibility of
current and future PCI cards on existing PCI architectures.

Therefore, I would be most grateful if you would assist me in anyway.  I
would appreciate any advice or comments regarding the "TMC" PCI54PV (OPTi
82C596/82C597/82C822 chipset), *or* recommendations for other
motherboards. I have included a summary, specification and a detailed
hardware description of the PCI54PV motherboard below this request.

At present, for combined Linux/MS-DOS/MS-Windows usage, Dan can supply a:

        * VLB SPEA V7 MIRAGE S3 805 2MB to drive their
          17" CD-1764TR XGA Colour Monitor
          (0.26mm trio pitch, Autoscan, Low-Emission, High-Resolution,
           Sony TRINITRON Tube, Microprocessor Control)

        * VLB IDE hard disk and floppy disk controller (J-Bond chipset) to
          drive a 525 MB IDE hard disk, 1.44 Mb floppy (3.5") and
          an IOMEGA QIC-40/80 ``250MB'' floppy tape streamer (DC2120 tape
          type).

I would also appreciate any advice or comments regarding the:

        * VLB SPEA V7 MIRAGE S3 805 2MB and the 17" CD-1764TR XGA Colour
          Monitor under XFree86-2.11 (X11r5) and/or XFree86-3.0 (X11r6).
          I've appended the specs on the CD-1764TR monitor.

        * IOMEGA QIC-40/80 ``250MB'' floppy tape streamer (DC2120 tape type)
          via the Linux Ftape.

Please, e-mail me directly (mm902p@uk.ac.cranfield). I'll forward the
collected replies to the maintainers of the PCI-HOWTO and Hardware-HOWTO,
and post a summary to the newsgroup.

Thank you.

                   Figure 1 - Function block of the PCI54PV


3.1 PCI54PV System Board
========================
``The PCI54PV is designed by implementing a PC54C/CT microprocessor and
a highly integrated chipset.''

The OPTi chipset is comprised of 3 chips:

        * 82C597 System Controller (SYSC) - The SYSC provides the control
functions for the host CPU interface, the 32 bit local bus interface, the
64-bit secondary cache memory and 64-bit DRAM bus. The SYSC controls the
data flow between the CPU bus, the DRAM bus, the local bus, and the
16/8-by ISA bus.

        * 82C596 AT Controller (ATC) - The ATC integrates the AT bus
interface and the data buffers for transfers between the CPU data bus,
local data bus and the DRAM data bus. It also provides ISA to local bus
command translation.

        * 82C822 VESA bus to PCI bridge (PCIB) - The PCIB provides all of
the control, Address and Data paths to implement the PCI bus from a VESA
VL-bus.

The 82C206 Integrated Peripherals Controller (IPC) incorporates the DMA
controller, Interrupt Controller, Systems Timer, and Clock/Calendar
functions.


3.2 P54C/CT Microprocessor
==========================
The P54C/CT processor is binary compatible with both the 486DX and 386DX.
The application instruction set of the P54C/CT processor includes the
complete 486 CPU instruction set with extensions to accomodate some of the
additional functionality of the P54C/CT processor. All application
software written for the 386 and 486 microprocessors will run on the
P54C/CT without modification.

The P54C/CT implements several enhancements to increase performance.
        * Increased the data bus to 64-bits and contains separate code and
data cache of 8Kb each with a cache line size of 32-bytes.
        * Contains a pipelined floating point unit that provides a
significant floating point performance advantage over previous generations
of the P54C/CT processor.

The PCI54PV is designed to accommodate a 75MHz, 90MHz or 100MHz P54C/CT
processor. The P54C/CT processor, once installed, will be driven by an
oscillator installed in ``OSC2'' by 3:2 frequency ratio. Therefore, for
90MHz P54C/CT processor a 60MHz oscillator must be installed in ``OSC2''
and a 66Mhz oscillator must be installed for a 100MHz Pentium.

3.3 Cache Memory
================
The P54C/CT processor includes separate code and data caches integrated on
chip to provide high performace. Each cache is 8Kb in size, with 32-byte
line size and is 2-way set associative. The data cache is configurable to
be write-back or write-through on a line by line basis.

For the secondary cache, the PCI54PV supports write-back cache memory
sizes of 256 or 512 Kbytes.


3.4 Main Memory
===============
The PCI54PV has 2 memory banks for up to 128Mbytes of main memory.  Each
memory bank of the PCI54PV consists of two 36-bit SIMM (Single In-Line
Memory Module) sockets that can accept 256K*36, 1M*36 or 4M*36 modules.

The SIMM sockets can also accommodate dual density modules such as
512K*36, 2M*36, or 8M*36 SIMMS.


3.5 BIOS
========
The PCI54PV contains a 128K*8 Flash ROM that contains the system BIOS.
The BIOS resides at the upper 64Kb of addresss in the first megabyte.

In protected mode, the BIOS is also mapped to the upper 64Kb of the 128Mb
space and can be accessed at either location.

The BIOS on the PCI54PV is compatible with the BIOS in the IBM AT with the
exception that it does not contain the BASIC interpreter. The BASIC and
BASICA on IBM PC-DOS will not run on the PCI54PV.  To run BASIC in systems
based on the PCI54PV, the should use the GW-BASIC interpreter provided
with the Microsoft DOS diskette.


3.6 I/O Port Address Map
========================
The CPU of the PCI54PV communicates via I/O ports. There are a total of 1K
port address space defined. The following tables list the I/O port
addresses used in the PCI54PV and those assigned to other devices that can
be used by the add-on cards.

The PCI54PV contains an MC146818 compatible Real Time Clock (RTC) and 128
bytes of CMOS RAM in the 82C206. The CMOS RAM stores the system's
configuration information entered via the Setup program. The RTC and the
CMOS RAM are kept active by a battery when the system power is turned off.

Note: The RTC and the CMOS RAM are kepts active by an on board
rechargeable battery. The PCI54PV also provides an interface for an
external battery.

Hmm.. I don't know about that.. will a PC boot without a video card? I 
wouldn't have thought so (haven't tried it though).

Date: 6 Sep 1994 08:01:34 GMT

Perhaps I'm missing something important, but has anyone compiled any of
the major applications (Mosaic, ncftp...) for term 2.x (specifically
2.0.4). If I try to run an app compiled for earlier term versions I get
the error "Connect: Invalid Argument".

If nobody's done it yet, I might set aside some time to do it. 

Regards,

Bell Tech.'s HUB-6 card.
I have one, and after several months of glorious messin around, I gotta ask,
does anybody know how, or know someone who might know how to set the hub6 
up properly under linux? I'm attempting to talk to it with a terminal, and 
when I put a modem on it, i get term ready and the flow control lights come
one just like when I talk to it with com1. Com1 and 2 work dandy BTW.

Any info at all would be greatly appreaceated.

I also have a computone inteligent card, anyone out there other than me 
intrested in writing a driver for it? I beleave computone has their SCO driver
construction kit on their FTP site.. I looked it over a few months ago...

Please e-mail replies if you can,

I have been looking around for a bootdisk to set up Linux on a System with
an Adaptec AHA 2842 SCSI-Adapter.

Recently Ive been told that one (still at the "interim-stage"?) is
available at:

   sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/linux/kernel/images/boot284x.tar.gz

Did anyone succeed to set up Linux with this bootdisk yet?

Any information is appreciated.

Thanks in advance

I'm pretty laid-back about the threat of Unix viruses.

When I see a wild one, I'll panic, and maybe do something.
So far, no "wild" U*x virus has been seen (as far as I know)

("Tame" viruses on Linux don't count - ANY competent programmer can write
a virus in a matter of weeks; true genius could probably do it in a night)

Note: The standard defenses against trojan attacks (tripwire and friends)
would also detect a lot of virus attacks. So I regard the possibility that
there is a wild U*x virus out there, still undiscovered, as infinitesmal.
