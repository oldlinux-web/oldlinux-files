I'm looking for sources to a small emacs-like editor(something like micro-emacs)
or jove. Essentiall, I'm looking for something small and friendlier than vi.
I want to bould this for my sun at work. I have jove at home(linux), but it's
binaries only :(

If you can point me as to where I can find any of these(or something similar),
I would very very grateful.

Has anybody read the article "Power of Cooperation" 
by J. Bruce Dawson on Linux in September issue of BTYE magazine-page
167-168. Check it out. It's a good article IMO. I don't have the magazine 
at my finger tips, but from memory I'll quote a couple of remarks from
the article. 
...
"Linux is not a bare-bones Unix clone. There is plenty of meat."
...
"Linux has become what the Internet community wanted: a robust, freely
available environment that has all the features of many commercial 
versions, but with the openess and cooperative spirit of the early days 
of Unix. It's anarchy at its best."

Subject: Upgrading Slackware releases
Date: 9 Sep 1994 14:56:23 GMT


I'm running Slackware 1.2 with the standard 1.0 kernel, and want to
upgrade to Slackware 2.0, since I've been told that will allow me to
configure and install later 1.1.X kernels, which have a host of fixes
for various networking bugs/problems.  I'm basically looking for hints
and tips as to the best way to proceed (I've already got all of the
relevant directories such as a1, a2, etc sitting on a separate disk
partition, from whence I can install packages).  Do I need to install
everything?  All I really care about is being able to run 1.1.X kernels,
which seem to be incompatible in certain respects (networking syscalls,
inits respawning too fast, etc), so is there some subset of packages I
can install without need to go through the whole works?  Are there issues
with new versions of shared libraries?  Do I have to track down and save
all the various configuration files I've laboriously modified over the
last few months, or does the Slackware upgrade process leave these be?

It can be found on sunsite in /pub/Linux/Incoming/linxdoom.tgz

there is also a lsm entry - total only 170k in size.

Hi,

        I have found in the "LINUX HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY LIST"
3 notebooks or laptop computers : 

        - Compaq LTE386s/20 (Notebook) (using XFree 1.2)
        - Compaq Contura 3/25 (25 MHZ 386 SL notebook with VGA type 
                        grayscale screen and 120 MB hd.)
        - Toshiba 1850 laptop

My question is : Is there another (or more) possibility ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would like to buy a "notebook or laptop" computer, unless it is not 
copatible with LINUX. (In this case, I would prefer buy a conventional 
PC). 

Thanks in advance, 

                Florence.

PS : What's the difference between laptop and notebook ??? 
      In french, we have only one word to say that.

Umm it seems to be unplayable on standard ISA video cards - even the better
dumb ISA cards. Anyone running it with an ISA S3 card and a 8Mb 386DX40 and
want to give a performance report since I need a new video card anyway.

On local bus 486 its neat... Just waiting for Xfree863.1 320x200 video

It has already been done.  Take a look at the dld library, as found
on tsx-11 in /pub/linux/sources/libs.  The newest version, that I am
aware of, is 3.2.4.

But I do suggest you upgrade to "dip337i.tgz", which will

Well, xfig can easily import eps. (click on the 'EPS' box and draw a
rectangle, in the menu that comes up, specify file/dimensions etc...)

Using any other formats (without using some conversion program(s) that
turn it into eps) is AFAIK not possible.

Because you have something to loose.  If someone finds out, that you
put your private loophole into your sendmail binary, it is quite likely,
that this will be posted to comp.os.linux.announce.  That should make
your mail box nearly as full as that of Mr. Green Card.

Yes, we do trust.  With anything else, that runs on your PC, you trust
Microsoft, IBM, Novell, Borland, etc., etc.

Also, in general, you do not sell your life when running Linux.  So
even when you are fooled, the damage is lost data.  The same can happen
from a hard disk crash.

Subject: A little advice
Date: 9 Sep 1994 19:51:52 GMT

Hello,

I hope that this is the the appropriate place to post.  If
not, allow me to appoligize right off.  Anyway, I am
interesred in installing linux on my PC and before I go
through the bother I was wondering if my current setup will
yield reasonable performance.  I have a 486-33 with 8 Mb of
memory and one hard drive split in a C and a Stacked D drive. 
I plan to get another drive (500Mb) for linux which I will
slave off of the first.  I want to keep the forst drive for
DOS/Windows stuff.  First, given this hard drive
configuration, will there be a problem installing linux and
XFree86.  I have read the installation guide and things seem
pretty straightforward.  I was just wondering if anybody with
this setup has encountered any major difficulties.  Second,
will my 8Mb of memory be adequate to allow me to open up an
emacs window, an xterm for processing latex, and a dvi
previewer?  Specifically, will my system crawl as I try to
process latex documents?  This is probably the most intensive
processing I will need to do.  For now I have no plans to do
any major code development.  Finally, are there any
communications applications out there on the net for dialing
into work etc. ?

Thanks in advance and please email me any replies.

The next problem you will be facing is the onboard-SCSI-adapter,
that does not use a NCR-Chipset but a chip-set from AMD
(as far as I can judge).

The QVision2000 (with the Matrox MGAII) Chip is supported the
earliest from XFree3.2 on. (that was the rumour on the net)

So until XFree3.2 the only possibility to get X running
is a server from a company called xinside ...
(If you manage to get the machine running under linux ...)

Please tell me if I am wrong ( I am fighting myself with
a XL 566 ...)

Please do not post questions to comp.os.linux.misc - read on for details of
which groups you should read and post to.

Please do not crosspost anything between different groups of the comp.os.linux
hierarchy.  See Matt Welsh's introduction to the hierarchy, posted weekly.

If you have a question about Linux you should get and read the Linux Frequently
Asked Questions with Answers list from sunsite.unc.edu, in /pub/Linux/docs, or
from another Linux FTP site.  It is also posted periodically to c.o.l.announce.

In particular, read the question `You still haven't answered my question!'
The FAQ will refer you to the Linux HOWTOs (more detailed descriptions of
particular topics) found in the HOWTO directory in the same place.

Then you should consider posting to comp.os.linux.help - not
comp.os.linux.misc.

Note that X Windows related questions should go to comp.windows.x.i386unix, and
that non-Linux-specific Unix questions should go to comp.unix.questions.
Please read the FAQs for these groups before posting - look on rtfm.mit.edu in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/Intel-Unix-X-faq and .../unix-faq.

Only if you have a posting that is not more appropriate for one of the other
Linux groups - ie it is not a question, not about the future development of
Linux, not an announcement or bug report and not about system administration -
should you post to comp.os.linux.misc.


Comments on this posting are welcomed - please email me !
