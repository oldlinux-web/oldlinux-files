That, and also (preferably) in $XUSERFILESEARCHPATH/Mosaic. Same
stuff, but putting it in its own file keeps .Xdefaults (or whatever)
short. By helping programs avoid reading stuff in resource files that
they would just ignore anyway, improves startup time of all X
clients. (I think more thorough explanation can be found in the X or
Speeding up X FAQs)

Yes, Mr. Frost, but then again, when my company purchased your
product, we were running Solaris 2.3 and when we called for
technical support, we were told that there (at the time) was no
certified version of your product for that version of the OS.
That made me feel that PC hardware compatibility was an easy
thing to deal with, when faced with the quagmire of the *IX
world.  Presumably, Solaris 2.3 wasn't on your "software compatibility 
lists" ?

Anyone out there have a 486/586 star complaint computer and monitor?

The idea of a 17" monitor and a 486/66 lasting hours on a 400 or 600VA

Date: 1 Sep 1994 03:00:05 +0200

This is the monthly report from the Linux Usage Counter.
It is posted on the 1st of every month on the newsgroup
comp.os.linux.misc

An uptodate version is always available by anonymous FTP from
ftp://aun.uninett.no/pub/misc/linux-counter, together with other
reports based on the same material.

To enter your registration into the statistics, send an E-mail to
linux-counter@uninett.no, with the SUBJECT line being one of

  I use Linux at home
  I use Linux at work
  I use Linux at school

The reply will contain information about how to register more
information about yourself, your machine and your friends, if you
want to.

If you can't do FTP, you can get the reports by sending the counter
an E-mail containing in the BODY one of the lines

//REPORT short
//REPORT persons
//REPORT machines
//HELP

Any questions should be adressed to the maintainer of the counter,
Harald.T.Alvestrand@uninett.no

Good luck!

=================================================================
Status of the Linux counter, as of Thu Sep  1 00:02:45 MET DST 1994

There are 7423 registered Linux users

I estimate this as being between 0.2 and 5% of the total number of Linux users,
giving the total community size something between 148.460 and 3.711.500 members.

See the file README.ESTIMATES for the details of why I think so.

I haven't seen S3 cards in your price range in Canada, but that could be
the function of the market.

The CLDG 5428 does 10 Mb/second raw video IO using SVGALIB applications,
which I am happy with at the moment. I don't believe an ISA card could
do this, no matter what the chipset is, simply because of the ISA
bus overhead.

But that is only an old Atari St version. The 2.60 is still not released
so I can not yet release my patches to make it work (Vince might

One of my fellow admins here at interQuest is running a mailing list
for discussion of Linux BBS software.  If you'd like to join, send the
command 'subscribe linux-bbs' in the body of a message to 
'majordomo@magellan.iquest.com'.

Subject: Is dialog vt100 compatible?
Date: 2 Sep 1994 21:01:00 +0800

  I am setting up my Linux machine as a terminal server and
use dialog to write a user interface. After I write one I use
a DOS machine to dialup and login (login shell is that dialog
script). I use both MS-Kermit and Telix to test it. Unfortunately
I find that there seems to be a terminal type compatible problem
(keyboard mapping and screen format/color problem).
So here I ask if anyone know if dialog vt100 compatible?  Or is
there any solution that I can get around this?
  
   Thanks.

    Complete? Well, by some definitions. Novell ships UnixWare without
man source, which renders commands such as 'apropos' not terribly
useful. Note that 'apropos' DOES ship with the system, and, when
asked, Novell says "Yup, it's broken alrighty, nope we aren't gonna
fix it, why aren't you using the Fingertip Librarian?"
    Or did you mean complete as in "all commands have man pages?" Try
"man dfspace." One of many I have encountered without a man page.
    In general, I like UnixWare, I support a dozen or so systems
running it. It definitely has its good points, but the man pages
certainly aren't one of them. IMHO, of course.

Another silly question
Can I just remove the 8250 from an (very) old Serial Card and replace
it with a 16550 to improve serial throughput?

Thanks

Nawww... I've been doing serious X development work at home (Frisk, for those
in the know) for months, with a 386/SX16 w/ 8Mb RAM + 24Mb Swap.  Sure, it's
slower than the P90 then I'm hoping to upgrade to in a few months, but with
my S3 video card it has worked fine for me.  Thanks Linus and others!!!
