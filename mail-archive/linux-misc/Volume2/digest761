If you're finding geting linux doom from sunsite a little slow
I've made it available for short-term access through ftp.netcom.com
in /pub/Linux as space allows.

I WILL NOT SUPPORT IT.  I will however support the playmidi package
that I wrote (which you will find in the same place - along with the
newest sound driver code).

I have not yet tested it, but it is the "newer" release from sunsite.

  ^^^^^^^

Actually, this is not true.  We purchased the ``Accelerated'' X server
from X-Inside a few weeks ago.  We also purchased an ATI MACH 64
specifically because of this and other advertisements which make such
claims.  After working through versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the server
without success, I called them back to get some technical assistance.
They finally told me that a later release would fix the problem (It's
not that the performance was poor -- the server never worked at all.)
They promised to FedEx a working version to me ASAP.  It never
arrived.  I called back.  It was to arrive two days ago.  Still nothing.

Jeremy Chatfield has not returned a single phone call.  Gary Anderson
was great at selling me on X-Inside but has failed to produce a
working product or deliver any of his promises.  I am actively
seeking a refund.

Let the buyer beware.

I would love to hear any confirmation about this......
This should not happen.  They did register "MS-Windows" and "Microsoft
Windows"  but I can't imagine they can register the concept of just "windows".
They did not create the concept, nor do they own the concept, nor
is MS-Windows the only popular windowing system.....

Date: Wed, 14 Sep 1994 00:15:15 GMT

I never played any doom except on Linux the last few days, but
when I got the newer version (with fixed pixel doubling) it was
very much slower. I eventually figured out why.

I had followed the suggestion in the readme (which is only really
hinted at): I don't have a sound card so I blew away sndserver.

Not running sndserver makes a tremendous speed difference for me.
With it there, everything is very jerky. Without, it is nice and smooth.
See how you like it. rm sndserver, or just make it non-executable or
move it out of your path.

Chris,

Below is a modified version of sample.dip for callback, which works with
dip-3.3.7h1. Note that after dialing there's now a check for errlvl != 1,
instead of 0, since in main.c we have:

  dip_addchat(&chat, "OK",         0);
  dip_addchat(&chat, "CONNECT",    1);
  dip_addchat(&chat, "ERROR",      2);
  dip_addchat(&chat, "BUSY",       3);
  dip_addchat(&chat, "NO CARRIER", 4);

The "wait CONNECT" after dialing has also been removed, since as of version
"g" or so, that's done automatically by mdm_chatseq() in modem.c.

My local and remote names happen to be the same -- I'm not imaginative -- but
they needn't be. Your netmask will probably differ too.

Hope this helps,

Daniel

Readahead will be performed on the CD, write-behind on the hard 
drive, and on many SCSI controllers, these operations will be
