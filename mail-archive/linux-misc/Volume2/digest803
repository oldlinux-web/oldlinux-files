Subject: driver for NE3200 (EtherExpress 32 EISA)?
Date: 22 Sep 94 15:49:22 GMT

Hi folks,

I have the following problem:
my current employer has an EISA-machine with an (for me) unknown
ethernet-card. It's a 
        Intel EtherExpress 32Bit ( NE3200 ) / EISA
I'm not sure this is the correct name, but i hope some guru on
the net will recognize it.

I looked through the kernel-sources (1.1.50), but couldn't find a
driver for this card (or is it the ac3200 in drivers/net?).

Does anybody know of this card, or is there already someone writing
the driver?

It's fairly important for us to get them working (the
destination-machine will have 3 of them).

Any information would be of great value ;-)

ciao
        SAM

You need to get started on reading the man pages for mtools and fdformat.

Fine resolution is usually meant to mean 204 dpi horizontally by 196 lpi
vertically.  (Some fax machine vendors refer to fine and super fine when
talking about 98 lpi and 196 lpi, respectively.)

Ask on a Linux news group.  The most commonly known packages are probably
gnufax (aka MIT netfax), mgetty+sendfax (which doesn't handle Class 1 modems
and requires preprocessing to handle non-G3-encoded images), efax (handles 
Class 1 modems, like sendfax in terms of handling PS, TIFF, etc.), and FlexFAX.

The best thing for you is a program that does what you want.  Stick with the
simplest software that'll satisfy your needs.  If you plan to send many faxes
and/or need a good client/server architecture then look at FlexFAX.

Use archie to locate the closest ftp site with the software.

Hi,

        I have a problem installing Linux on a 486-66 PC.  The PC has
        a soundblaster SCSI-II with an NEC 3x CD-ROM.  I'm trying to 
        install Linux on logical drive D via CD-ROM.  The boot command
        I'm using is:  linux aha152x=0x340,10,1,1 root=/dev/hda5

        The problem is that the root gets mounted but hangs after I 
        see this message:  VFS: mounted root (umsdos filesystem) read only. 

        I have downloaded all how-to files and am still unable to get
        the system to boot.  Thanks in advance for any help.

The advice you have gotten so far ranges from good to useless.  The most 
important factor has not been discussed.  You want to use a couple of 
unix programs to write your thesis.  They have been ported to OS/2, but 
they are not native to that OS.  For basic functions under the conditions 
you describe, linux will be faster at running unix applications.  I have 
run the apps you speak of (except the draw package) under both systems 
and cannot tell you that one is markedly faster than the other in 
graphics mode (X or presentation manager), but because you have to run a 
BASH command interpreter to get full functionality, linux is more 
convenient to set up and use with these _unix_ programs.  

The real question is: Why would you want to write a THESIS on emax and 
latex?  There are many comercial products which are much better suited to 
that particular task which will run native under OS/2 or in a dos or 
windows box under OS/2 and give much better performance than the unix 
programs you mention.  Your school should have a site license available 
which would make the cost almost negligible.  Describe and Ami-pro are 
two excellent OS/2 native word processors which would meet all of your 
text editing and formatting needs in a single package.  If you got lotus 
smarsuite you would get the graphics package as well.  WordPerfect and 
Microsoft (shudder) also have robust (more robust) word processing 
programs which run great under OS/2.  Someone else wrote of using mission 
critical apps on unproven systems.  The point is well taken.  Why run to 
a less full featured application to develop your mission critical 
document.  I cannot slam the OS on this point, as linux has been rock 
solid for us, and we do use linux for mission critical research 
applications.  We also use OS/2 for mission critical apps.  None of the 
mission critical apps under _my_ supervision run on anything other than 
one of these 32 bit OS.  Just remember, don't choose an OS or an app, 
then figure out how to make it work for what you want to do.  Get a clear 
picture of your objective (I'm guessing- to make a very large document 
and keep track of numerous footnotes, figures and associated text, and 
bibliography), and then find the best available application to perform 
that task, then get the OS to run it to your best advantage.  Until 
recently WordPerfect/dos was the only legitimate choice, which you could 
run under OS/2 to get some degree of multitasking.  Now, the major 
windows programs are the clear kings of this hill.  Lotus says that 
AmiPro is at the same level in both Win and OS/2 versions, so this might 
suit your needs (os/2 that is).  Of course, the one fly in this ointment 
is any time you have invested in learning EMACS.  All of the traditional 
desktop apps will be much easier to learn and use, but if you already 
know EMACS backwards, forewards and sideways, it is probably too late to 
make a big switch, although I learned most of Word's pertinent features 
in a couple of days.  

OOPS, I started prostelatizing.  I said I wouldn't do that anymore.  sorry.

The error message tells you why it's happening, your system does not
have a math coprocessor and your kernel lacks the emulation package. You
can correct either problem, either by using the correct kernel for your

I didn't know that Slackware came with a kernel with no emulator as

Wrong. Actually, wordprocessing was the reason why I threw away
ms-dos and windows from my computer in the first plase. WP4windows
just keeps crashing and I think it is mostly because of Windows itself.
(Printer driver crashing the display driver or wp_one_file crashing
another wp_other_file. And yes I was using version 6.0*a*). I'm
much happier using LaTeX under linux (or any other Unix)

Databases I don't use.

Windows spreadsheets are not powerfull enough for my use (limited
support for importing *large* textfiles and simply not enough
rows and collums anyway.)

Presentations graphics, well I guess if you are a business person
what is awailable is pretty nice, but still not stable on
windows and I do much better with pbmplus, gnuplot and XITE
for image manipulation graphics and so on.

I don't know much about LAN server and Netware, but in our
environment using TCP/IP based unix machines as fileservers
and SUN PC/NFS for the msdos/windows machines, it was
*much* easier to get linux on the net (slackware 2.0) than
it was using msdos. (No looking around for drivers for
my 3com card, just install the nettwork version of 
the kernel, add tcp/ip and I was on the net.) And
it still has not been a single crash.

Acctually I suspect that the "Nationalized" version of windows

important.?

I've got a Mach 32 card. The current version of the windows
driver is 2.3 but it still has problems with Maple V-2 for windows.
The mach 32 X server I'm using on the other hand works without
any problems (used it for over a month now.)
I guess "real" (i.e usable) support for mach 64 in windows
will be available at about the time Chicago starts shipping.
(Which means they will have to start all over again...?)

Windows durability is about 2 hours.. (The time between reboots.)

Very possible.

Well, IBM seams to realize that MCA is not going 
to survive very much longer.

This is still an academic net. I don't know how many commercial
places are connected at this time. Anywhay, "nobody has ever
been fired for buying IBM is still an important phrase".

Well...

You can low level format an IDE drive, but you have to have the right
software.

It's no longer the $3500 it was when IDE first happened; I gather Disk
Manager either 5.x or 6.x can do it for a lot of drives.  But I do _hate_
drives that lie to the operating system about their geometry.  Blows my
elevator seek algorithms all to hell...

In article <1994Sep20.184952.1@vaxc.stevens-tech.edu>, I wrote:

I have been getting a number of email messages about this section
of my previous post so I guess a clarification is in order...

   Based on my interpretation of the original message, the
   person was saying to connect the IDE drive to the middle
   connector on the IDE ribbon cable and the SCSI drive to
   the SCSI cable.  The idea was that the computer was to
   find no IDE drive, boot off the SCSI drive and then find
   the IDE drive using [I assume] some sort of driver or 
   utility.  I am also assuming they are trying for some sort
   of slave with no master setup or some kind of BIOS setting.

   I realize that the popular opinion is that IDE _must_ be
   the boot drive but this person says it works the other way
   for him and I have no reason to question his motives in
   saying this.  If this person wishes me to repost his original
   message, I will do so.  Or if he wishes to add his comments
   to this thread, he is free to do so.  Otherwise, I'm just
   going to leave this topic as is and chaulk it up to an
   unverified urban legend.

I have tons of experience with SCSI and a good amount of experience
with IDE and I know putting the two on one ribbon cable is not a
good idea--kind of like putting gasoline in a diesel engine.
I have not mixed IDE and SCSI or gas and diesel and have absolutely
no plans to do so!! (I do however know people who have done the latter
to our ambulances and the long downtimes this has created.)



Additional comments:
====================
-One respondant mentioned using a Control Concepts combination IDE, SCSI,
 4-floppy, 4-serial port, 2-bidirectional parallel port board.  Company
 is an advertiser in Byte and is based in either Virginia or Texas.

-Another respondant mentioned having seen a IDE/SCSI controller offered
 by Tiger but no more details were given.

-Finally, after more searching, I found Buslogic contact information:
