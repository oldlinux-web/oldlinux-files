If you use mgetty+sendfax, you don't activate modem autoanswer, it
will listen for the RING returned by the modem instead. Note that
with mgetty, you have to use /dev/ttyS? for *both* incoming and
outgoing calls.

I've seen enough requests for this that I'll post my (working) Xconfig file
for the CLGD-5428 to anonymous ftp on my home system in /pub/linux.

You may have to edit the mouse parameters or whatnot, but the 256 color
server and ModeDB entries should work with *any* SVGA capable monitor. 
Three modes are available:  1024x768i, 800x600, 640x480  My monitor is a
fixed-frequency SVGA type which won't let me do much else, but you're
welcome to add your own tiddles to it once you've got it working.

My setup is 1.0.8 kernel, XF86 2.1.x, GD5428 w/2Mb DRAM.

And I thought I was the only one with such problems.  I get a
connection, but packet by packet it gets slower, until about one packet
per minute is being sent.  This is for tcp connections like telnet or
ftp, ping always works just fine.  It is interesting to see that while
the connections hangs, there is indeed no traffic on the serial line.  I
guess I have to try if PPP works better, because so far nobody could
give me any hint about what to try or even cared to comment on it.

I haven't used EIDE drives, but I have several SCSI drives with more

2.0, be sure to set Linux fdisk (version 1.5b) to non-DOS

OS: Linux 1.1.49

Is there a way to make X (Xfree 2.1.1) give up the mouse device, when X
is idle. (in the same way that X give up the mouse when switching VT)

In case you wander why I need to do that. I have a second modem connected to
/dev/cua2 (have the same IRQ as the mouse, /dev/cua0). I would like to use
the second modem (to page me and monitor my phone calls), when I am not at
home (X is idle). Now I can use the second modem only when I switch VT. (I
had to disable selection).

Close.  Corsair is now basically the same set of client side interfaces

Basically true.  But who's the "they"?  Certainly not the Corsair team...

Not true.  Running a billion dollar company is more complex that you paint it.

Subject: Bash Arrays[?]
Date: 2 Oct 1994 21:41:53 GMT

Greetings from the exasperation society,

I'm wondering about the compatibility of BASH with the KORN SHELL. 
In particular, I'm trying to access individual components in an
array.

     tempvar=`file *`

This is no problem.

     echo $tempvar

Displays a nice (space delimited) list containing the info from
`file *`.

But when I try something like:

     echo $file[1]   or   echo${file[1]}

I come up zero.  And likewise:

     tempvar[1]=`file *`

won't work either.  Does BASH use some other method?  Is that
method portable to sh, csh, and/or ksh?

Thanks,

MS DOS only can see its own file system; doesn't know about other types.
Linux can see MS DOS filesystem and HPFS (OS/2: read only).
For completeness, OS/2 can see MS DOS and HPFS file systems, but not Linux.

So if you want to read/write files between Linux and MS DOS, you use
Linux and do a mount such as:
        mount -t msdos <filepartition> <mount point directory>
where <filepartition> is where you dos partition is such as 
        /dev/hda1
and <mount point directory> is a linux directory such as:
        /msdos

Remember too that MS DOS uses the 8.3 name convention so you should
name all your files accordingly.

Well... Don't forget that MS targets the _general_ market, i.e. your 
grandma, grandpa, and dog in addition to you, the superuser. For 
_general_ users, MS Windows with Windows apps is probably a better choice 
than Linux. But not necessarily for me or you.

Yeah, but could the 8088 in 1981 run UNIX? Probably--Microsoft did buy 
Xenix. But Lotus 123 was written for DOS, which was what probably 
solidified MS-DOS as _the_ major OS for Intel boxes.

Don't forget that the Unix world is also trying to standardize on a GUI

Alpha, if I'm correct, is also 64 bit. Is DEC/OSF 64 bit? (Actually I'm

I personally think that there's place in the computing world both for

different audiences, with only a little overlap.

        The Computer Aided Modeling package Algor is available for Dos, 
        Windows/NT some commercial brands of UNIX (AIX, SunOS, Irix, and
        HP/UX). I have spoken to a representative of this company and 
        expressed an interest in running this under Linux, either as a 
        native app or with the iBCS support now maturing. Unfortunately 
        they don't have an SCO version that we could try with the iBCS 
        support now available. She indicated that letters sent to here 
        attention at the following address would go a long way towards 
        showing an market interest in a Linux/SCO version. Unfortunately 
        this company does not see fit to provide an E-mail address for their 
        customers and prospective clients (perhaps this lack of convenient 
        access method should be pointed out in the letter!) so this will have 
        to be done using snail mail. So anyone who would like to see a port
