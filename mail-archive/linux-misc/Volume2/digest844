How do you plan to split (and rejoin) the signals?  What happens if one 
modem gets a fuzzy line?  That would cause it to hang or fall back to a 
lower speed, what happens then?  

Are you trying to tie your Linux box into your work network?  or ar you 
just doing terminal emulation?

Subject: SCSI card and drive
Date: 26 Sep 1994 19:30:34 -0400

Hiya:

First, I know next to nothing about SCSI, so if this question is naive or
just plain stupid, please bear with me. I looking to add an external hard
disk and since I have a spare slot, I figured this should be via a SCSI
controller. Now, I figure an Adaptec 154x is good 'cause it's supported by
Linux and that should be a good start. I don't have any room in my box for
another drive - I have two, so I figure an external SCSI hdd would seem the
logical choice. Anyone have any thoughts on this setup? I would like to 
keep my two segates - one for dos/win, the other for Linux partitions and
use the SCSI hdd for the bulk of the Linux file system. Could anyone comment
on this proposed setup and offer suggestions as to prices and dealers? I'm
primarilly concerned about the external hdd. 

OR

Should I go with the Adaptec card and a large SCSI internal and forget about
an external? Also a SCSI-2 card is okay? As I mentioned, don't know squat
about SCSI, but am looking at it as a definite enhancement/replacement for
my current setup. TIA!

Hello all !

Two weeks ago i send the following message, but i get no responce.
So I post it again and hope someone can answer me:

Can someone help me ? I want to use my Colorado streamer DJ-10 with
controller card FC-10 on my Linux system ! I get the patched ftape-driver
from sunsite and compiled it successfully. The modules were compiled same
and I'am using kernel version 1.1.49.

Now when I give the command "mt -f /dev/ftape reten " the tape go's from the
beginning to the end and return. That is it what the tape should do, but
when I want to read from the tape with:

mt -f /dev/ftape erase

or 

mt -f /dev/ftape status

the tape moves and I get the message: I/O error !

Can someone help me about this problem ?

You can reach me via Internet at the adress:

usera@wema10.elektro.uni-wuppertal.de

or you can post an articel at this place !

Thank you !

Because my life is finite?

LaTeX just does a better job of typesetting than any WYSIWYG editor I have
seen. With the number of changes you have to make to get a dissertation out
the door, WYSIWYG is insanity. Show me any WYSIWYG editor that can include
and preview EPS like LaTeX/dvips/ghostscript, or set math like you can with
LaTeX. Also, it's very easy to get all the stupid formatting details that
Graduate Colleges have, and then once the style file is written, voila! So I
just had to put in "dissertation" in the first line, and I knew it would be
accepted by the University. I knew all the page numbers, section numbers,
equation numbers, figure numbers, indices, bibliography, etc. etc. would be
right. (And then I changed that one word to "tr" and got a departmental Tech
Report.)

Sure WYSIWYG's are peachy keen and neato, and the chicks dig it, but they
didn't quite do what I needed. (Or what the Graduate College wanted.)
And then when you factor in the cost ($0), and the robustness (there are
very few commercial packages as solid as TeX) there is no contest.

And all that was on a Sun Sparc, and I am delighted that everything works
exactly the same on this Linux/X11 PC I'm using now.

This was not really a factor - I just use emacs as a text editor, and
learning ^B ^F etc. is no different from learning whatever you have to to
use the "desktop apps". Emacs even has an online tutorial and help that you
can use at any time. I can even point and click with the mouse, use
scrollbars and pull-down menus etc. if I want to.

  YES!!!    I am runing WP for SCO on my linux box right now.   It is FAST!
I have 5.1 and went through some contortions to get it running.  But now
it works.   There is a demo version on ftp.wordperfect.com that is derived
from the first version of Wp for SCO.  It is REALY slow.  I am happy to say
that my copy is not.  

  First I copied the IBCS2 files to my machine.  /pub/linux/ALPHA/ibcs2
from tsx-11.mit.edu and installed them.   recompiled it and the kernel.  
I am using 1.1.42 of Linux.   Then loaded it via insmod iBCS in my rc.local
file.   Then I hacked the install for 5.1 and now I can run it.  I just 
cd to wordperfect/wpbin and run xwp.   Never used the terminal version of
wp.  Just the X version.   Hope this helps.  Robert

Yeah,what. As I understand, Panasonic doesn't use IRQ nor DMA, only software
polling, which makes it slower,and it causes more CPU-load than Mitsumi with
IRQ and DMA enabled. I have tested both drives, and seen that myself, which 
is why I bought a Mitsumi.

Date: 29 Sep 1994 08:43:46 GMT

Hello,
I'm about to buy a second harddisk of about half gigabyte.
I've asked prices for both the
  Western Digital (Caviar) CA2540
and the
  QUANTUM LPS540
Pricewise they're comparable.
Hence my question : Which one should I buy ?
Or should I go for yet another brand ?
There are some constaints that limit my choice :
I have an IDE controller (which I don't intend to replace)
and the drive should coexist with my current drive, which is
a Seagate 1239A (a 240 megabyte drive).

All advice is greatly appreciated !
Thanks a lot in advance,
Piet

When I ported AMD to linux a very long while ago, we did not have *any*
NIS/YP implementation. Currently we have at least two. So if you want
NIS support then just take out the hash sign (#) from the config/Makefile.linux
line that says HAS_NIS_MAPS and recompile. But dont forget that the YP
implementation must also integrally support the automount map as a valid map in 
its domain. Since I use NYS I am sure that it does. Your mileage may vary with
the YP implementation that is in libc.
