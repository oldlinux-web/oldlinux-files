This is not related to software, but to hardware.  With the 1542C you
just have to be more careful selecting good cables and having the proper
termination at the ends of the cables.

efax 06b was (to my knowledge) only sent out by the author to certain
individuals who were having trouble with USR Sportster 14.4 modems.
While the patch may make other improvements as well, that (and an
upgrade to kernel 1.1.42 or later) was what did the trick for me.

It should really be Ed Casas' prerogative to decide whether to upload
the patch somewhere, but as he's on vacation at the moment I can mail

The netpbm packages seems to have a lot of errors. Use the pbmplus
package (you find it on sunsite). It does not use shared libs, so
the executables are larger, but they work without errors or allocating
lots of megabytes.

I'm looking for a colour flatbed scanner to run off my Linux PC,

letter paper size, or about 300mm x 400mm).

Does anyone have any recommendations ?

I'm trying to get bootpc to work. 
No matter what programm I use I will always get " No response from bootp

As there is NO documentation, I can't imagine where the problem
really is. 
Bootpc is known to work under dos here at university, but when I try to

( and my boss want's me to get this fu**ing bootpc running :-(  ).

Subject: Installing a new kernel on the Slackware Boot disk!
Date: 5 Sep 1994 12:45:25 GMT

Hello,

Forgive me if this is an FAQ, but I've scanned the ones that come with
Slackware 1.2 and can't find anything usefull...

I would like to know how I can create a Slackware boot disk (the one used
to install Linux from scratch) and install a kernel of my choice...

Why? So I can make use of an alpha network driver to perform an NFS install
and save copying 100+ MB of Slackware 2.0 on to floppies :-)
 
I've formatted a diskette with "fdformat", 
added my kernel with "dd if=/zImage of=/dev/fd0", 
created a ramdisk with "rdev -r /dev/fd0 1440", 
and changed the root file system with "rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/ram" (I think :-)

The bit I can't work out is how to tweak it so it asks for the ROOT disk, 
and copies that filesystem to the ramdisk, after the kernel has loaded...

Please don't tell me this requires a specially modified kernel :-)

Any and all hints gratefully accepted (email especially appreciated since
this *ensures* I can't miss your response :-)

  Yup, money very well spent. The best thing for readers of the LJ IMHO
  is that they can steer the editors towards where they want them. If

  If there is enough interest, I think you can send a request to LJ where
  they can spend an article on it. Examples for me are the articles on
  EZ, the articles from Michael about the libraries and VT interface. Examples
  of shell plumbing, how to use 'icmake', ...

  For 19$ (?), money well spent...

  For me LJ brings back the 'crisp feeling' of a (very old) 'Byte'. I hope

As a result, he sent me a new version of the perfmeter and exccellent,
it runs properly.
Send me a disk, I will copy the files and I send this disk back to you.

Please note, I am in Denmark at the 28. of this month (September) and I`

Although I usually use emacs, if you really don't want it there is always

The original bootpc source for linux includes a boot file name of "linux"
in its bootp request, which according to the bootp rfc prevents any
bootp server from replying, unless it also has a suitably named bootfile
available for tftp. So I would recommend to eliminate this bootfile name
in the bootp request construction in the source.
Hope this helps,

Greetings Linuxers!

I was rummaging around in our old hardware box today and I came across
a couple of 200MB ESDI drives and an Adaptec 2322D ESDI controller. My
problem is, someone seems to have beat me to the card and pulled all the
jumpers off. I have no idea what the jumper blocks are for. Whoever put
the stuff in the box must have trashed the handbook 'cos it's nowhere to

Has anyone out there got a handbook for a 2322D? If you have, could you

Many thanks in advance.

When linux sees a 16550A it enables the FIFO. Easy as that.

Thanks for all the positive feedback.  When I saw the question I was

We aren't just a magazine that decided to cover Linux, we are Linux people
that decided to do a magazine to help Linux.  We aren't perfect but as our

(Actually that is an understatement as we are still spending more than our
income but with your support we expect to be breaking even early next
year.)

If you have comments, by all means send them to us (linux@ssc.com is the
easiest address.  SSC publishes Linux Journal and we just converted the
office over to a Linux network.)  Or you can mail them to Linux Journal,
P.O. Box 85867, Seattle, WA 98145-1867 or FAX to (206) 527-2806.  We do
publish letters to the editor and we do even listen to them.  The initial
direction of Linux Journal was set by a survey I posted to comp.os.linux
over a year ago and we continue to use this feedback to set our future
course.  (The tag line on the cover says "The Monthly Magazine of the
Linux Community".  I fought hard to get that line on the cover (the word
"community" kept disappearing :-) ) and want to make sure we continue to
