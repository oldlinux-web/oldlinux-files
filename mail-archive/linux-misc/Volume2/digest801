Date: 22 Sep 1994 09:08:49 -0400



I'm trying to get Linux running on my machine (a VLB/ISA/PCI 486/66, 730meg
IDE HD for DOS, 330 meg SCSI-2 HD for Linux, NEC CD-ROM drive) using the
slackware release from the august Linux Toolkit CD.  Since my nice PCI 
Adaptec 2940 controller isn't supported under Linux, I've yanked it out
and am currently using the 1520 on my SB16 card.

I boot linux from the boot & root disks I created (have to enter
"ramdisk 152x=aha152x,11,7,1" at the boot: prompt to get it to recognize
the controller) and got through setting up the partitions, installing the
software, etc. with no problems.  However, I have yet to be able to actually
use Linux once it's installed on the drive.

I've tried booting into Linux several ways:

The boot disk Setup created - spews out all kinds of error messages that
    scroll by too fast to read.  Kernel panic, crash.

LILO from HD - L1010101010101010101010101010101010101010101.... into infinity

LILO from floppy - as above

I've been rebooting from the install disks, re-installing the OS (apparently
the only way to change the LILO setup from the install disks is to
re-install it) and trying to get it to work.  I know I need some
variation of the aha152x line from above, and have tried a number of appends,
but have never been able to boot yet.


Can anyone shed some light on what I need to do, or possibly send me an
example lilo.conf file to show me what it might be supposed to look like?
Or is this not so much a problem with lilo.conf but with LILO itself?

This is exactly the case on my system.  It seems that only the hours on my

Thanks for the reminder, too.  I had the electrician put in a new outlet for

OK.  here is the scoop:

Most PC motherboards have really cheesy cache setups.  The cache works
fine as long as you don't put too much RAM in.  When you get too much
RAM, the cache does not work on the upper part, so on a 16 Meg system,
you may only have caching on the lower 8 Meg.  If your cache RAM is 15ns
and your DRAM is 70ns, and your cache hit rate is 90% for the lower 8 Meg
and 0% for the upper 8 Meg, then your AVERAGE time for memory access is:

lower 8 Meg: .10 * 70 + .9 * 15 = 20.5 ns
upper 8 Meg: 1.0 * 70 + 0.0* 15 = 70 ns
overall:                          45.25 ns      

So, by adding the upper 8 Meg, you have more than doubled the AVERAGE time
to access memory.  The cache makes a big difference.

The fix:  upgrade your cache to 256K.  Don't forget to upgrade the
cache tag RAM as well, or you will still get no benefit from the 
additional cache.  Some motherboards are so cheesy that it is
impossible to cache the whole address space, even with the maximum
cache RAM.

Baloney! :-) I have MS-DOG, OS/2 and Linux on my 386DX33 (w/ 8MB and 15MB swap)
and I would say Linux runs faster than DOG or OS/2. It certainly compares 
favorably with the RS6000 system, running AIX, at work. It's not slow (unless 
you're comparing 386 speed with 486 or Pentium speed. But what the hell do you 
expect? That it will run eqqually fast no matter which chip you're using?).

>>You need more ram. 8MB is not enough for X. 

More baloney. 8MB (with a decent sized swap) is just fine (unless, of course,
you're running LOTS of things simultaneously, and you have no patience).

The suggestion that you need some kind of monster computer to run Linux is
absurd.

Sure, but XWindows is still a small enough pig that you can feed and care for

Features, no.

Your EIDE drive will work just fine with linux as-is.

To use the fancier features, assuming you have an IDE interface card
that supports them, you may need additional software support.

But the drive will work fine as is.

Depends on what you want to do. A 286 with NCSA telnet is something like 
a Linux machine in text mode with virtual consoles. At home I have a 386 
running Linux, a 286 running NCSA telnet and a VT100 connected to the 
386. I prefer the 286 with NCSA telnet as "second workplace" because of 
the virtual consoles. The VT100 is only for emergency purposes, such as 
killing processes (as root).

IP addresses must be unique, true -- but unique per host, or per host
interface? The RFCs don't say. I say ;-) that I can't think of any problems
with using the same IP address for multiple interfaces, and in fact it's a
good idea to do so (it avoids wasting network addresses).

Fortunately not, or else we'd still be using BSD 4.2ish networking with
all-zero broadcast addresses.

While the SB16 SCSI has the 1520 chipset, it doesn't have the
bios in rom which should mean that it would be impossible to boot
any hard disk that is attached to it.  I may be wrong, but I'm
pretty sure I remembered correctly from a prior posting elsewhere
since I had a similar question when I purchased my SB16SCSI.

Within the last several days, I've seen posts regarding ftape-1.13b-patched

would they be willing to post it here?  I've asked in c.o.l.help topic about
this and decided that I needed to cover the bases.

The main problem with it now is ftape hangs the process and you can't kill
the thing until the kernel panics and throws the box into a tizzy.

I've got the 1.13b-patched files, as well as the new modutils.  I'm running

Hello Linuxers,
I thought it would be interesting to know:

integer and floating point calculations (plain C) and results for "pentium-optimized: -O4 -mpenium" code turned out to be even slower (5% on integer, 20% on floating point calculations) then the standart distribution gcc-2.5.8 code !!! So, don't mess with that Intel optimized compiler.
