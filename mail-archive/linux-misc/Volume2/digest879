Interesting point.  Would anyone care to port ROSE to Linux?  It's an
SGI-based sequencer, available in source code from at 
ftp.maths.bath.ac.uk:/pub/dream/ROSE.ALPHA.tar.gz and ROSE.sources.tar.gz.

I've used it on my Indy, and it's quite a nice package... would be cool
to see this running on a Linux box...

           Linux is more compliant to POSIX.

NetBSD has grown to be pretty much as POSIX compliant as Linux.
FreeBSD isn't quite as far, there yet.

This should be taken with a large bucket of salt, however (as Terry
Lambert points out), since none of the systems have had an official
POSIX verification suite run on them.

I think that a 200mb root partition shows
signs of someone misusing /tmp :)

I personally use a 20mb root partition at home, 30mb @ work,
and about 200-500mb /usr partition (depending
upon how big /usr/local is, and whether
or not it is mounted from an nfs server --
i usually use /share for that). I then
either mount /tmp as a separate drive
or link it to /usr. There are performance
issues for making swap and /tmp on 
their own disk drives if you can.


reasons for a root partition (small):

The root partition is needed for machine boot
and checking the other partitions, so
it should be a small, infrequently changing
filesystem to minimize chances of corruption.
(hence the moving of /tmp away from it) 

if it is small, you can have more than one of them,
so you can have an emergency boot partition.

You are kidding, right?  And how does one just `pick up' groff commands?
This is a lot of effort, and IMHO could be far more productive, bang for buck, 
put into learning a bit of TeX.

But for the time being, try EZ from the auis package.  Nothing to learn, good
output.  And pick up the TeXBook to lear how to go beyond the capabilities of 
ez.

Groff has its uses, but for document preparation has been superceded by TeX.

Which is why you are using groff.  BTW, ez uses groff as well, but you don't 
have to use the commands.

I usually use TeX.  My kids (8&10) use EZ, and find it easier and better than

i don't know exactly, but what you probably just have top do, is to make a  
fake user (best call him ppp), which login shell is the pppd-program with  
the right parameters, and the right dev. i don't know how to find out the  
device one is logged on, but that should not be too hard...

Juana,

As others have pointed out in great detail, this probably isn't a real good 
idea.  All the snippets you describe negates all the power of Linux you wish
to show.

However it's clear there are some issues to be addressed:

1) Linux has no applications.

   I had a discussion with one of my co-workers over this very issue. We agreed
that it's very difficult for non commercial development to generate the
breadth and depth of applications that DOS/Windows commercial environment
has. His take on the solution is to bring new environments (the MKS Toolkit)
to the existing platform area (DOS/Windows). However I think the three
pronged approach that Linux has can work:

- Write native applications with similar characteristics to existing
  commercial applications. The Xfilemanagers are an example. One that is
  sorely needed is a simple wordprocessor.

- Make available all of the traditional Unix apps.

- Use emulation to run the myriad existing applications of other environments.

2) Unix is too hard to understand.

  Human beings are quite adaptable. When presented with a computer based
environment they will learn to conform their actions to within the scope of
that environment. That's why many folks are satisfied with DOS/Windows. Since
that's whay they learned computer based stuff on it defines their expectations
of what computer environments should look like and how they should behave.

  Since Unix is a different environment in many user's minds it's 'hard'.
The problem is that isolating the user from the differences often negates
the capabilities that a different environment brings.

  I think Juana has taken this concept to an extreme. Linux is no good if
it just acts like DOS/Windows. There's no benefit to switching. In fact
because of the applications issue, it's often a detriment because the 
apps that people want to run are no longer available.

  The solution to many of the " it's too hard " issues can be addressed:

- Add some simplifying scripts for mundane administrative tasks.
- Promote the documentation even more that it is now.
- Most importantly get people to generalize. We know that all computer
  environments have a command that displays files. The name isn't relavent.
  So when you approach a new environment and 'dir' doesn't work don't give
  up. Just find out the correct command. Just an example.

3) Setup

  Initial setup of Linux is daunting. It needs to be even more automated.
Slackware's setup is a excellent start. What it probably needs right now
is a better mechanism for partitioning the disks. A question:

How hard would it be to write FIPS for Linux? While FIPS for DOS is fine
it would be even better if it ranunder Linux directly.

UMSDOS is helpful here also.

4) Transisitional stuff.

DOSEMU needs to be in the distribution. It goes a long way to giving a
transistional environment.

WINE desperately needs to be finished. Everybody (except me. I'm working on
my PhD) needs to drop everything and get WINE working.

These tools will greatly ease the transisition.


=====

The bottom line is that both the Linux system and former DOS/Windows users
will have to change and grow together. Asking either one to change radically
is unfair and undesireable.

Later,

BAJ

Subject: SURVEY: Graphics card benchmarks under XFree86 (05 Oct 94)
Date: 5 Oct 1994 00:24:47 GMT

Archive-name: xfree86-benchmarks
Version: $Id: post,v 1.30 1994/10/05 00:02:38 fbm Exp fbm $

These are the latest results from a survey of xbench results under XFree86.

The idea of the survey is to compile a comprehensive set of benchmark results,
obtained by running xbench against all the main 386/486/586 graphics cards,
and thereby place the graphics cards in an approximate performance ranking.
Ideally all the results should be gathered using the same host machine,
on the same day of the week, while wearing the same socks and jocks.
Unfortunately no-one has yet come forward with such a database (although
such databases are rumoured to exist).  This survey is the next best thing.

The summary results below distill the essence of the survey into single line
entries.  The entries are grouped by XFree86 release number, and ranked
in decreasing 'xstone' order (last column) within each group.  Ranking by
xstones is a bit arbitrary.  It is instructive to examine all the other
columns too.

The xbench survey has a home on the World Wide Web, at

    http://thumbtack.bevc.blacksburg.va.us/xbench/

If you have acess to a Web browser, check it out!  It is at least
6 x 10^24 times better than this plain old Usenet posting, in lots of ways.

New additions to this database are always welcome - especially entries for
the latest servers or for unlisted graphics cards.  If you use XFree86,
you can contribute to this survey.  Grab a copy of xbench, make sure it
has the GraphicsExposures patch (see below), run it on your machine,
fill in the blank form provided below, and mail it back to me.
Please do not send the raw xbench output - just fill in the blank form!
I will collate and publish the results as they become available.  XBench is
available by ftp from hundreds of archive sites around the world.
Check out archie for your nearest site.

  >>>>>>  IT IS IMPORTANT TO USE THE CORRECT VERSION OF XBENCH.  <<<<<<

The correct version is the one with the "GraphicsExposures" patch.
Check for this by looking at your source code - you should find calls to

    XSetGraphicsExposures(......, False);

in the four files bitmapcpy.c complex1.c screencpy.c and scroll.c

Some sites known to carry the patched version of xbench are:

    ftp.physics.su.oz.au:/xbench/xbench.tar.gz
    ftp.iastate.edu:/pub/netbsd/misc/xbench.tar.gz
    mcsun.eu.net:/os/linux/BETA/X_S3/xbench.tar.gz
    mcsun.eu.net:/os/linux/BETA/X_S3/xbench.tar.Z
    ftp.th-darmstadt.de:/pub/X11/other/xbench.tar.Z 

    xbench.tar.gz file length=88785, /bin/sum=48788, /usr/5bin/sum=31503
    xbench.tar.Z  file length=156750, /bin/sum=21120, /usr/5bin/sum=40999

To run the benchmark,
    1. If possible, switch into one of the more common display resolutions
         before starting, e.g. 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 etc.
    2. Kill off (i.e. exit from) all other programs on your machine,
         including your window manager!  The only running program you
         should need is a single window from which to start xbench.
         XBench is a benchmark program.  If it has to compete for
         memory or CPU, its results will suffer.
    3. Read the XBench README file and edit the script.run file.
    4. xset s off                                   (turn off the screen saver)
    5. xbench < script.run > results/YOURFILE
    6. go have a coffee
    7. awk -f scripts/xstones.awk < results/YOURFILE

Where can I find out about FreeBSD?  I'd just like to know who makes it
and how you get it.

Thanks,

Subject: Flexibility of process priority for realtime tasks
Date: 3 Oct 1994 12:34:33 GMT

I'm considering using a Linux based platform for MIDI sequencing and
other musical tasks where things must occur at specific moments in time,
which you don't want to be interrupted, even by a few msec (because the
music will have a hiccup in it).  The question is not one of having the
majority of the CPU power, it's a question of relying on the processing
getting done in time for a scheduled event.

I've heard from people who have experienced real grief under Unix
systems with such objectives.  It seems that you can only go so far in
giving the process an extremely high priority; the OpSys will still
interrupt it to perform one task or another, and you get the hiccups, or
worse.

Some Unix implementations offer more freedom than others.  I understand
that on SGI machines, there is quite a lot of flexibility.  Does Linux
offer any special features for precise event scheduling, or can someone
tell me if it is particularly flexible in this area?

Thanks,
Greg
