Subject: 3 Problems with Linux. Please Help!
From: levinson@vax.sonoma.edu
Date: 23 Sep 93 21:13:19 -0800

I have a few problems.  

1)
First of all, I have .99pl12.  I notice sometimes my
keyboard locks on boot up.  I never had this problem on .99pl11 or less.  I
have tried to recompile the kernel with both NUMLOCK on and NUMLOCK off, but
with the same problem.  Pressing the numlock and/or scroll lock keys does not
toggle the lamps, so, this leads me to believe it is some kind of
driver/initialize problem.  I have tried different keymaps, but the keymaps
would not matter since the keyboard is not being recognized.
This happens regardless on if I use LILO or the standard raw boot image on a
floppy.

2)
Minicom-
The version that comes with SLS1.01 has some problems.  Pop up windows leave
strange characters on the screen when they disappear.  The VT100 emmulation is
not very good.  There are no linefeeds, and when I do a ^A A to turn linefeeds
on, stuff comes out double spaced.  When I try to recompile the distribution
for MINICOM on sunsite:/pub/linux... it compiles, but when I run it, I get a
Segmentation Fault and it dumps the core.  Is PCOMM any better?

3)
Someone mentioned this before, but I will bring it up since I think it needs
looking into by the developers of Linux.  Compiling is very irratic.  Sometimes
I get linker failures, sometimes I get compiler errors, but when I recompile
even without rebooting, everything compiles correctly.  There may be something
wrong with memory management, or the compiler itself, or maybe even a library
entry.


If anyone has any information on how I can remedy any of these problems, please
write private-email.  I will definately try them and post a report when I get
it fixed.

1-1/2 hours?  I have a 386SX/20 with 5 MB memory.  It does take a very long
time if I don't use a swap file.  I set up a 4 MB swap file and it takes about
30 minutes.

You still have to run make in /linux, however if all your other object files
are already compiled, it will see a newer date for the config file than the net
object, and only recompile net.  For everything else, it wont need to recompile
and it should say that everything is up to date.  Everything will have
to be re-linked, but that does not take much time.

Yes. It is another BETTER package.  Slackware's maintainer is much more
responsive to updates and general support than the SLS people are.  I think
this is because SLS is really intended for sale as a commercial product.
The SLS betas seem to just be proof-or-concept type things.  They work, but
you have to be pretty good at unix in general to get functional use out of
them.  There are many bugs and inconsistancies in SLS.  The man pages could
stand some real work, There are many duplicate executables in /bin
/sr/bin and elsewhere.  There are also duplicate man pages. 

SLS X is difficult to get running on even supported video cards.

TeX isn't a wordprocessor, it's a TYPESETTER, and a very good one! Besides, if
you like learning Emacs/Vi and lots of utilities lying around linux, this
combination gives you the ULTIMATE wordprocessor!

Hi!

Thanks to everyone who answered my request. I tried again yesterday,

I changed them and now it works.

oh, I don't know if I understand you, do you want to compile Linux under
***MS-DOS*** ?????? I use Linux at home and at work for 6 months, and I mean
that Linux is a Unix-System, isn't it? And you would really compile it under
DOS? Don't you know, that, if you start Linux on DOS (ROTFL), it deletes all
files with the string 'Microsoft' in it?
Nice idea, very nice. But you can compile (and link!) Linux better under
Linux. So, first install Linux, then enjoy it, delete your DOS-partition,
*then* you can compile Linux :-))

We have a couple of older Sparc systems that compile OI and OB faster
than the 32M 486-33.  The Sparc system has 96M of memory and 3
Solbourne Series 5E's and very fast disks.  I've seen SCSI-2 disks

The SLS release requires that you set the I/O mailbox port to 0x340.
At least that's what my 34F requires.

All this because the autoprobe code doesn't to know when a range of
ports is in use to not use them for other cards.

Are you sure it is their home directory that is the problem?  What
exactly is the error message, and what exactly was it they were trying
to do?

One possibility would be that somehow / or /home (assuming their
homedirectory was /home/name) did not have execute permission for
other or group.  Do

        ls -ld / /home /home/name

to see exactly what the permissions are.

> chmod 777 name

This should certainly allow the owner and anyone else to have write
permission to the directory.

I think these are your options:

a) boot Linux from floppy
b) boot Linux with bootlin (or whatever), a DOS program that boots
   Linux (i.e., you first boot DOS, and then use bootlin to boot
   Linux)

It is possible that the following might also work.  I have neither
experience nor documentation (at the moment):

c) you install LILO as the master boot record on your first hard drive
   and tell that to load Linux from the second hard drive

Not to mention that so are the filenames and some of the utilities

Linux is not really meant to be compiled under DOS (cross-compilation
from another Unix system is easier to manage, though).  You probably
want to install Linux (from one of the many installation kits that are
available) and compile it under itself.

I'm sure you just HAD to tell us that.  Try to keep your unproductive and
