I am trying to build NFSD from source code so I have a better understanding

The problem is that there is no 'standard' way of handling partitions above
the 1024 cylinder limit in the partition table.  Thus any partition
extending above this limit may possibly be a source of difficulty
on a machine which adopts a solution different from that adopted in
the Linux fdisk.  Still, I may be able to change the message to
be more helpful in the next revision.

Subject: Mouse intermittent in X386
Date: Wed, 15 Sep 93 15:33:29 GMT

Hi,

I am having a teensy bit of trouble running X386 under Linux.  I
installed the latest SLS release yesterday and everthing works fine,
I even managed to configure X-windows to give me 1024x730
non-interlaced from my rather cheap monitor which has never done
anything like that before, well anyway back to the plot, I am having
some trouble with my mouse.  About 3 out of 4 times that I run X the
mouse refuses to work properly, the pointer jumps all over the
screen randomly as I move the mouse and it thinks I am pressing
buttons when I am not, it basically looks as if it is getting the
data from the mouse but making a mess of interpreting it.  However i
can generally cure the problem by switching to another virtual
console ( by pressing <ALT><CTRL><F1> e.g.) and then switching back
to the console with X on.  If i do this a few times, the mouse
starts working, and stays working as long as I dont switch consoles
again.  

        I am using a Microsoft Two button serial mouse in COM1 and
it has worked perfectly with everything in the past.  The mouse test
programs hidden in the X386 directory somewhere work fine, (
although they do tend to play up a bit if I already have X386
running in a different console when I run them)...

Unplugging my mouse and plugging it back in doesn't do any
good.....I have been fiddling with all the parameters in the Xconfig
file that I can think of but nothing does any good., I get the
feeling that something else is trying to talk to my serial port and
screwing up the settings for the mouse driver, but I can't find
anything remotely suspicious....

Has anyone seen anything like this before? All suggestions will be
greatly recieved as this is beginning to get annoying. 
I wanted to try someone elses mouse but I won't be able to borrow
one for a while and am completely stuck in the meantime.  I would
like to try COM2 instead of COM1 but that is 25 way instead of 9 way
and I will have to try and scrounge an adaptor from someone which
may take a while.....Anyway if anyone has any ideas mail me at 
                sjd8@tower.york.ac.uk

Oh...Just another thing...ghostscript complains about IO permissions
from VGAlib and I can't figure out what it is having trouble writing
to , this doesn't cause me too many problems as I just 
 run Ghostscript as root which cures it , but it would be nice find
out what the problem was...


        Anyway, apart from that everthing works fine, ( and a lot
faster that DOS..)

                Byeeee
                        Steve

Sure, why not?  I have been using a couple of compressed DR-DOS 6 partitions
with Linux for months, and it is quite true that Linux can't read them
(directly).  I still recommend booting your Messy-Dos off of a small
uncompressed partition, particularly if Double-Trouble is involved.

You should be able to access your compressed partition from Linux via
dosemu, but that won't come any where near the speed of Linux access
to a normal DOS partition (which I have timed as being 2-3 times as
fast as native DOS accesses!).

yes I had this exact problem, which is caused when the serial port 
is hung up by getty, it drops the DTR (which, since its a null modem), 
drops carrier) and gived getty a HUP causing it to quit.

I got around this my slightly modifying serial.c so that it didnt ever
hang up a serial port.  (no hardware of mine needs it)

the modifcation in serial.c is as follows:
(about line 583)

                        }
                        if (clear_bit(RS_EVENT_HANGUP, &info->event)) {

                        }

At Softeach 93, The Sun booth was showing SunSoft's version of
Wabi, a program running under Unix which supposedly will run Windows pgms as
fast if not faster, then a similarily equipped 486 with MSDOS and Windows 3.1

It was a supposed project of a few Unix vendor's but Sun is the first one
out to market it with it's version of Unix for PCs.

Unfortunatly, I got no information whether Wabi will ever be sold as a
separate package, although other Unix vendors will introduce it shortly.

The only doc they gave me sez it is not software emulation, but replaces the
calls to the Windows API to Unix's API and any system calls are passed through.

  OK, here we go again: 'windows-linux swap in common?'. Perhaps time for 
moving this into the FAQ (I assume it's not there already, havn't checked...)?

  A swap *file* cannot be shared inbetween, as dos can't access the linux file
system and linux can't swap on the dos file system. However a linux swap
partion can be made into a swap file for windows at the cost of a few
seconds longer time to reboot. If you want to do things the same way as I
have done then follow these steps: (remember to subtitute the sizes and
partions to match your computer, else.... bad luck!)

1) Decide how much swap space you need and create a partion to swap on with
fdisk (or any other disk partioning program). I chose to make it about 6M or
to be exact 5967 blocks large and on /dev/hda4. Make the partion a DOS
partion. Mine is a primary 12-bit-fat (id 1) partion.

2) Erase the partion completely so that it will compress to the smallest
possible size. This can be done with :
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda4 
while running linux. If you want you can use norton's wipeinfo to
'Wipe the entire drive' but this must be done after step 3). Neither
'format f:' or 'del f:*.*' will erase the data on the disk, they just
delete the information in the directory block(s) and wont work.

3) (Re)Boot dos. The swap partion will show up as a new 'disk letter' in
dos, which dos wont be able to read (dos says something like 'Invalid
media error on drive F'). My swap partion shows up as F:.  Format
the new drive:

c:\>format f:

4) Start windows (if you are running windows 3.0 you must start it in
real mode: c:\>win /r) and create a permanent swap file as large as the new
partion. Ignore the warning that windows won't use more than the recommended
size, it will. In windows 3.0 this is done by closing ALL active applications
excluding the program manager, selecting File/Run and run 'system/swapfile'. 
In windows 3.1 it's in the control panel under '386 Enh' and 'virtual memory'.

5) Reboot your computer into linux immediately after creating the
swapfile. DO NOT start windows.

6) Save and compress the swap partion to a file:

dd if=/dev/hda4 | gzip -9 > /.winswap

Since you erased the whole partion the compressed file will become
very small; from my computer:

23:27-oden:/>ls -l .winswap
-r--------   1 root     root         9431 Apr 10 20:23 .winswap

7) Place the following commands in your /etc/rc:

/bin/mkswap /dev/hda4 5967
/bin/swapon -a 

and a line in /etc/fstab describing your swap partion:

/dev/hda4       none    swap    defaults

8) These commands will destroy the dos partion and the windows swap
file and must be restored before windows can be used. I do this when I
reboot linux automatically with this script which I have named
/etc/reboot and with a link to it from /etc/halt:

----/etc/reboot-----snip-----8<--------
#!/bin/sh -
if [ "root" != "`whoami`" ]
then
  echo "Sorry "`whoami`. You must be root to reboot!. Exiting.
  exit 1
fi
echo `basename $0` in progress. Please standby
swapoff /dev/hda4
/usr/local/bin/gunzip < /.winswap > /dev/hda4
exec /etc/.hidden/`basename $0` $*
----end /etc/reboot-----snip-----8<----

and I have moved the original /etc/reboot and /etc/halt to 
/etc/.hidden/reboot and /etc/.hidden/halt

9) Enjoy.

10) Realize that 6M swap isn't enough. Sigh :-(

I have seen some peolpe suggesting that it is possible to just save
the beginning of the partion (just enough to hold the boot block, the
fat and the root directory), and others saying that you must save the
whole partion but I havn't bothered to investigate this matter, the
solution above works just perfect.


/Kristian

p.s. I hope I havn't mistyped anything but anyway: Be careful when
dealing with the disk partions as you will blame yourself to death
when you have erased your whole dos partion with your five years worth
of work on just because you typed /dev/hda4 instead of /dev/hda3 ;-)

Not really necessary - you'll just need to do the patching by hand,if you
have the kernel version with built-in KLMs.Otherwise this seems to be done
twice in a that strange manner,that it will cause a Kernel Panic.
Some minor patching of kernel-interface.c is also needed - but that's no
