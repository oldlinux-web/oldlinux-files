Subject: Linux X DOOM (it works)
Date: 12 Sep 1994 19:03:39 -0700

I am running DOOM under X on my 486 DX 33 with only 8 megs. runs fine at 
320x200 size..  Looks small in my 640x480 xwindows screen.. but hey.. it 
plays!

  Sound:   You MUST have the sound-kit 2.90 installed and compiled into 
your kernel. Otherwise sounds bites the big one. By removing the sound 
driver pogram that comes with doom (rename it from sndserver) you can 
play with out sound at all.. Sorry: No music.. Just FX

 Frame rate: 0.5 frames a sec? that bites.. mine is at least 15 to 20 
fps.. very playable..  yes.. wish I had a VLB Dynatime..

  (oh yeah.. mines just a simple 1meg tseng et4000 isa)

  For those with the pixel doubling problem.. get the newest version of 
the game. They fixed it and it is on sunsite.unc.edu... thats where I got 
mine..

  yep.. pixel doubling eats alot of overhead.. be fast and have ram.. 
then you can jack up the pixel duobling..

  or be like me... keep looking here in the areas for how to force X into 
320x200 mode..

It works fine for me.  (I have one userid with 9 letters.)  Linux

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HI Folks !

I'm looking for infos on the ReadLINK ENET16/U Rev. C Ethernet-Card.
This card can be jumpered for WD80x3 and NEx000 mode and has a lot of
jumpers on board :

  J10   Eprom-Addr            A18-A13
  J9    I/O ADDR              A8-A5
  J11   NE1/NE2

  J14   EPROM SIZE
                E16K
                E32K
                E64K
  J6A   Upper IRQ's  (15,11,10)
  J6B   Lower IRQ's  (2,3,4,5,7)

Whatever setting i choose (WD oder NE), whatever IRQ/IO i choose, the card  
is recognized but

  - in NE-Mode the card hangs together with HD-Access  CRASH
  - in WD-Mode, all works fine, but the cards (2 of this kind) don't
    recognize one another on the NET

I got these cards very cheap but without infos.
Can anyone post me infos for this card ????

HELP !!

Perhaps the ET-4000 is just a slow poke?  At the time I bought it, I thought
it would be the most compatible and best performing for the price range.
(I replaced a very annoying and incompatible ATI VGA Wonder).

I will continue to fiddle with things.  I don't expect much better performance
than 1 FPS even if I use all the tricks I have left to try :(
(Before anyone can ask- I am not swapping, X seems to work fine, not running
any sound drivers at all).

Verified.  I can revise my findings and add more information. 

1) My estimate of 6 FPS under MS-"DOS" was grossly understated- I would say
   it is more like 20 - 30 FPS  (sorry if that messed anyone up)

2) Indeed- if you do not have a sound driver installed, then remove the
   soundserver from your .doomrc and move the executable out of your path
   or rename it.

3) As predicted, screen size (X mode) and choice of window manager has
   little or no effect on speed.

4) With sndserver present, but un-used, high detail- 0.5 FPS
5) With sndserver removed, high detail- 2.5 FPS    huge difference
6) With sndserver removed, low detail- 3.75 FPS (but SMALL!)
7) With sndserver removed, low detail, and the screen size (under options)
   is set to smallest possible (almost not visible)- about 15 FPS.

(Remember- 486 DX 33, 16MB, SCSI, Orchid Prodesigner IIs ET-4000 16bit ISA)

Hope this data might help someone else troubleshooting or just trying to
compare for benchmark's sake.  Was thinking of going to the "big" VA Beach
computer fest this weekend- wonder what new video card I should consider
buying for good X performance (on ISA, unless I upgrade MB too for VLB or
PCI or whatever is current now)  :)  ;)

[ Article crossposted from comp.os.linux.help ]

[ Posted on Tue, 13 Sep 1994 03:25:35 GMT ]

Hello!

Has anyone installed the apsfilter successfully?  I have a standard
Slackware 2.0 setup.  I grabbed the apsfilter and installed it according to
the instuctions, but every time I try to print, I just get errors.  For
example, if I type "$lpr /usr/ghostscript/lib/examples/chess.ps" (I'm not
possitive about the path), withing seconds, my printer (BJ200) spits out a
gs error message to the likes of:

Error: /undefinedfilename in --file--
Operand stack:
    (cheq.ps)  (r)
Execution stack:
    %interp_exit  --nostringval--  --nostringval--  --nostringval--  false 
--nostringval--  --nostringval--  --nostringval--
Dictionary stack:
    537/547  0/20  6/200  30/70

The page is then ejected, and the same things happenes again on a new sheet. 
I have to turn my printer off and #lprm the print job.  I have never gotten
apsfilter to work, which is surprissing, as it is supposed to be the easy
way to set up printcap.

PS: I have set the PRINTER environment variable to several of the "auto"
printers created by the installation script of apsfilter.

Any suggestions or experiences will be greatly appreciated!

How can msdos floppies contain files with the setuid bit set ?
Besides, the man-pages say that 'user' implies 'nosuid', and a couple
of other flags to make mounting safe.

I hate to diasgree, but this probably isn't the case.  I get the same 
error message with talk when I try it from my machine, but if I telnet to 
one of my Unix accounts elsewhere and try to talk to the exact same 
person, it works fine.  I don't know if this is a bug or just something 
not set up properly, but it is certainly something wrong on my Linux 
box.  (Slackware 2.0)

Try the NFS-Preformance patch from Florian La Roche. We're getting 2-3 times
higher throughput-rates than without. Approximatly 550kbyte/s to a sun on the
same subnet; I have not tested it between to linux-box.

I should work with your kernel-version (1.1.50). 

I will send you the original post (patch included) via email.
