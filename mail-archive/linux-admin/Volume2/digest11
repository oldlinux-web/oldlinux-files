Subject: Termina Hanging Problem
Date: Thu,  1 Sep 1994 01:14:53 -0400

I need help. I have running Linux 1.1.28 w/ slip.

My terminal - xterm - hangs at seemingly almost random times. It
generally only happens when I'm inputting characters into the terminal
window. It looks as though no more input is being accepted and output
stops being displayed.

Doing a netstat I got Recv-Q to be some 700 and Send-Q to be 0.

It seems as though bytes are being buffered by the socket, but the
data isn't being read from the socket. It also looked like data was
still being sent because Send-Q was 0. I then typed ls then did
another netstat.

I got Recv-Q to be some 900 and Send-Q to be 0.

It seems as though ls was executed by the remote machine and the
result was received by my local machine and being queued in the
buffer. However, the display on my terminal window did not change - no
"ls" nor any result of ls.

Any help to solve this problem will be greatly appreciated.

The crond in rc.M should only be started if you haven't installed TCP/IP.
So it's strange that you have two cronds running.
BTW my workaround is to change the entry in rc.inet2 to this:
        ${net}/crond -l0 -d0 >/dev/null 2>/dev/null &
I know that is bad but I got rid of the annoying messages.

This typical problem seems to be caused by one of two things:

1: dip needs to be setuid to root,

2: make sure dip is compiled with the right path for route and ifconfig.

Well, be careful when hitting the RESET button. I had linux on a UMSDOS
partition on a 100MB drive. I started X, and the disk kept accessing & 
just wouldn't stop. In a panic, I hit RESET. What I heard was the worst sound
you would ever want to hear from a computer disk. As the disk was a couple
of years old, I took it apart. The mechanism that moved the heads back & forth
across the disk was physicaly broken. I think a better solution would have
been to turn the power off. Then back on after the disk stops spinning. 

BTW, I learned from my experience. Linux is now very happy on a 340MB 
drive with Linux swap & Linux native partitions. The speed difference 
of Linux on Linux native partition vs on UMSDOS partitions is very big.
With the UMSDOS partitioned version of Linux it would take 60 minutes
to compile the kernel. With Linux partitions, the same Kernel compiles
in 15-20 minutes. 

Hardware config:

Salckware 2.0
Kernel 1.1.18
486/DX2 66
8MB ram
16MB swap

You don't need a password when sending mails. Passwords are only requested

Dumb question: is the idea that we should ENABLE or DISABLE the

So is Pascal, actually.  There is a Pascal-to-C translator called p2c
somewhere on sunsite, and I think there is an alpha version of gpc
(GNU Pascal).

You don't need to recompile anything.  The easiest way is to delete the 
binaries for hostname and domainname and reinstall those from the Slackware v2
distribution.  It is just a case where if installing over the top of an old 
installation where hostname and domainname share the same executable, you are 
actually only effectively installing one of the new executables (due to over-
writing).

There have been anumber of fixes that suggest re-compiling from source!! You 
could get the same problems if you don't remove the original linked binaries!

i think i know what the "failed" is from.
i had it as well until i fixed the setting for my Adaptec SCSI.  check the SCSI FAQ.  it's
not the simplest thing to read--but hey, it's a document for running UNIX :)  anyway, there
are some notes about adding command line parameters to LILO.  when i fixed that, the CD-ROM
worked and "failed" went away, to be replaced by information concerning the CD-ROM hookup.

hope that helps.
