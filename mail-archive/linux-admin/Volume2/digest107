Subject: problems compliing kernel 1.1.49, 1.1.50
Date: 25 Sep 1994 21:28:23 GMT

I just got a new motherboard with onboard ncr53c810 scsi
controller.
SO I download sources for kernel 1.1.45 and the patches 46, 47, 48,
49 and 50.

I patch my way up to 50 first and do a make config,
then do a make dep ; make clean.

On a make zImage , it basically barfs all over me with some cpp 
problem.

So I clear the directory and patch my way up to 1.1.49 this
time. make config works fine, make dep ; make clean workes fine.

make zImage worked until it barfed and gave this error message:

I have both /etc/HOSTNAME and /etc/hostname on my system and it
still can't remember the hostname between boots.  I issue:

You might try piping the tar or cpio output through a dd filter with
a huge obs, 1 MB or so.  Then dd will wait for a full output buffer
before writing it to tape in one long stream.  Your disk accesses will
alternate with your tape writes, but it beats lots of small stop and go
writes.

Or even easier, hold down shift and press the Page-Up key.  You can only
do this after you have scrolled on a VT and not switched to another.
Note that because the kernel just moves the start of the text buffer,
you can actually scroll all the way back to the bios message (on AMI at least).

Subject: (extraneous?) double clicks freezing X server

I've got a recurrent and very annoying problem with X freezing up (it's
happened two or three times today). Every time I have to hit reset, I fear for
my filesystem. 

It seems to be related to mouse double clicks that aren't needed/caught by any
applications; although initially I blamed it on a couple of apps (xfilemanager
and xfm), it happens too often. (Actually xfm's application workspace/shell
won't respond to my current mouse at all, from memory) 

I saw a post lately about "defining double clicks" or something to that effect,
but I can't find the reference. 

I have a sneaking suspicion its related to another, less urgent, problem which
I've posted twice, to no avail. I've tried 1.1.18 and 1.1.45 kernels, and both
have not run X properly. They start slowly or not at all (flicking from X to
another VT and back gets it going) but don't respond to the mouse (or keyboard
either in the case of 1.1.18, if I remember rightly). It's a dual mode ms/mouse
systems branded CPC BTW. But the problem occurred with an ordinary MS mouse as
well. 

Sorry for occasional imprecision; I'm in a windows mailer.

Did you use "clock -w" to explicitly write the time to NVRAM?  Using
"date" alone will not set the CMOS clock.

Any SCSI DDS drive can be used with the SCSI tape driver (it works here,

He should properly shutdown his system (that includes remounting root
read-only). This remounting can be achieved with 
   mount -o remount,ro -n /dev/his_root_device /

(this command normally takes place in a shutdown script (rc.0 for SysVInit
v2.5).

You just have to mount only clean file-systems ;->

The essential problem is that, at shutdown-time, it is nontrivial to unmount
the root partition. In fact, you never unmount it, but you have to
remount it read-only (mount -o remount,ro -n /dev/root_device /), thus marking
it clean.

Hope this helps...

Nah, iBCS has supported auto allocation of the major for a long time (longer 
than the kernel has in fact). So does the latest MAKEDEV script via 
/proc/devices. Just set the major number to 0 in the Makefile and run 
'MAKEDEV update' after insmod'ing.

  The reason iBCS still has a hard coded major in there is because it still 
supports earlier kernels. On kernels that do not have the auto allocation 
code for major numbers it is a bad mistake to register and unregister major 
0.

  At some stage I intend to change the default in the Makefile to 0.

The 'other' computers on your network, the 'two linux boxes and an
alpha', need to have the default route point to the one IP address
assigned to the eithernet adapter on the system with the PPP link.

You should have built the kernel with IP forwarding on the kernel with
PPP. The other kernels should not be built with IP forwarding.

I do not know about the situation that you have here. You seem to have
all of the IP addresses in the same IP domain, 192.315.98. If you have
the default route set correctly on the other computers on the network,
then you may have to forgo a network route on your ethernet for the
specific host routes to the indivual IP addresses going to the
ethernet. It will take someone who has more knowledge in ethernet
routing than I to answer that question.

>192.215.98.2 is the service provider.

What's going on with your service provider? This is very strange that
you would be given an IP address on the same IP domain as theirs. They
must do host specific routes for all of your IP addresses to you. What
a waste.

There's an even simpler way.  (Linux 1.0.8, XF 2.1.0)

1. Hit Alt-Ctrl-Backspace (kills X)
2. As soon as you see the text screen, hit Ctrl-Alt-Del.

I've also had no problems shutting down, or rather rebooting with

shutdown -r now

                                                                 There is
   going to be a problem, too, with OS/2 3.0.  As anyone who's already
   tried the beta will already know, the current read-only hpfs
   filesystem does not work with Warp's HPFS.

The patch for that will show up when Linus gets back from Australia,
at some point.  I'll append it below if you're in a hurry.

I think this may be a bug in the 'ls' you're using.  I don't see
this problem -- I can ls and cat these files just fine.  I can't
connect to the directory 'maintenance desktop', though -- this is
a bash bug.  Luckily, I do not want to cd to this directory.

   Those are the extended attributes (in other words, your settings
   noterbook for the file).  I think they're stored in an odd way on DOS
   FAT filesystems, which is where you see this error.  However, I seem
   to remember seeing somewhere an announcement of a msdos fs update that
   fixed this.  Am I making this up, someone?

Aha.  I hallucinated this too.  If it's on a FAT partition, that's a
more likely story.

(Sorry about the delay on this, by the way -- I had a hard time getting
them to ship Warp II to my correct address.)

Here is the patch:

Subject: SLIP and TIA problem
Date: 25 Sep 1994 23:48:41 GMT

Has anybody got TIA working with Linux's SLIP? I can't seem to get it
to work properly. I can telnet to the TIA server/host immediately
after starting SLIP, but shortly afterwards the telnet session hangs,
and further telnet to the server/host hangs. 

[TIA is like term except it's slightly more transparent than term and with
some limitations. For further info ftp to marketplace.com]

THanks, Delman.
