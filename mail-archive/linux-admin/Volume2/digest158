Greets all.

I'm attempting to run the websterd server on linux.

I've gotten the client & server sources that David Curry
wrote at Purdue.

I've managed to get it compiled, but there seems to be
some sort of problem using libdbm.a.  

It compiles and links fine, but for some reason, calls to
dbm_open or dbm_fetch seem to fail.

Does anyone have any sort of inkling of what I speak?

Is dbm the problem here?

Do I need some sort of external dbm software?

I'm running a full Slackware 2.0.1 installation.

Thanks.

Don't want to waste a lot of bandwidth with the articles but the October 1994

I am interested in installing GNU Finger 1.37 on my Linux system.  However,
when I try to compile it, I am missing some header .h files, including
acct.h.  Where do I obtain these?  Or how do I modify the code so I don't
need them?

Same sum here on a 1.1.33 kernel, and same problem on two machines running it.
Since I know it's there, killing/restarting inetd is a bit of a pain only,

Subject: Please help: Routing problem
Date: 6 Oct 1994 23:52:55 -0400

I have been trying to finger this routing problem for weeks but could
figure what is wrong with configuration. Please put your 2 cents.

We are assigned a full class B network of 152.52.0.0.
And the netmask for this network is the regular 255.255.0.0. Now, I
want to create a separate ethernet with one linux box with subnet 152.52.9.0. 

This client will have the router (the sun) to talk to machines outside this
subnet and on separate networks. What I don't understand is: the router
is siting on the 152.52.0.0 (le0)  physical network with the rest of machines 
on the same network and also 152.52.9.0 physical network (le1).

The router can talk to 152.52.9.2 (the linux client) and all the machines on
152.52.0.0 network. But, the linux client cannot talk to the machines on 
the 152.52.0.0 network. 

This is the route table on the router (sun box):

Reply-To: mike@jaws.ae.utexas.edu

I just upgraded from SLS 1.01 to SLACKWARE 2.0.0 with a 1.0.9 kernel
and XFree86-2.1.1.  I have a Tangent 486-50 with a Diamond Stealth
VRAM (:-<) and a 14" Sampo monitor.  X used to work with SLS.  Now when
I type openwin I get the xview screen with the mouse pointer a 1/2"x1/2"
white square with several black vertical lines in it.  The square moves
properly then the mouse is moved and the screen properly changes when I
switch between 1024x768 and 640x480 modes.  And no errors show up on the
console when openwin starts or ends (except for a broken pipe when it's
killed).  

However, the xview logo does not disappear as it should and the window
manager does not show up on the screen.  A ps -axu shows openwin, startx,
X, olvwm and olwmslave.  I can type xterm at the console and switch
back to vt 7 and see the xterm but it doesn't respond.  Other X apps
do the same - show up but don't do anything.

Any suggestions as how to fix the problem or at least what it is?

Remember that FTP is running two simultaneous sessions with the other host, 
a data channel and a control channel.  With only a standard two-wire modem,
the line must be repeatedly turned around from TX to RX and back again.
(Four wire, dedicated-line modems are pricey.)  Services like news and
the web have little upstream traffic, mostly downstream, since they
have no control channel.

Subject: Dial-in and Dial-out on one modem?
Date: Fri, 7 Oct 1994 00:49:31 GMT

Can I dial in and out over the same modem? I do this on SCO Unix machines 
all the time with no problems. The dialer changes the modem settings
to turn echo on to dial out (to detect "CONNECT" messages) and turns
echo off when done. If I leave echo on, the port sees the login
message echoed back and thinks someone is trying to login. This 
causes TD and RD lights to be on all the time. If I run ps it tells
me someone is logging in as "login: Welcome to ........." (whatever
displays from the /etc/issue file and the login prompt). If I turn
echo off (Q1E0) then cu never sees the "CONNECT" message. How can
Linux change these settings each time I dial out, and change them
back when I am done like SCO does?

You haven't given any details of what the error was, but I guess it's
because you haven't read the readme in the kernel source directory
that warns about the new directory structure.  For example, there is
no longer a 'asm' directory, it's a link and if you install by
patching you should clean up very carefully.  It's best just to get
the complete tar file and wipe /usr/src/linux clean before untarring.

By the way, you posted to the wrong group with this question (should
have been .help).  Consult Ian Jackson's frequent postings to c.o.l.*
about appropriate places to post.

I tried this in my XF86Config file. The card is probed correctly as
S3 864 with 20C486 RAMDAC. But the server can't set the clockchip.

What is the problem? Is it the right ClockChip statement? Has anyone
this card running with XFree 3.1?
