I have this one "hanging around" in my filebase, too.. I took a look at v1.7? I
think, but at that time a decided to use tsoft's nfs257* 'cause there's been
much less (read: nothing, after \etc\hosts and \etc\fstab have been set up)

useable.. - just my opinion..

Hm. I might give XFS* another try if I'd knew if it fixes the filedate problems

I just loaded up the minimal (4Adisks) version of SLS 1.05. While I can 
assign 
passwords to non-root accounts from root.. I can't change passwords from 
the non-root accounts (for the same account of course).. I get bumped 
because it doesn't recognize the old password.

If I try to change the root password on root, the change goes through 
..but the password is not the one entered..i.e. I lose access to my root 
account!

Anyone experienced the same problem or have a solution? ...I want to 
resolve this before expanding my system.

Good timing. I just saw your article today, but I uploaded a working rdate

Maybe the last sentence isn't quite right, but you can turn it off if

Routed overwrites the Kernel 1.0.xx memory tables.  Eventually it will crash 
the system, depending how big the routing table becomes. I my case, within a 
few minutes.  Routed does not work properly anyway (the Linux version). The 
only way out is Gated, which I now use all the time... BUT it cannot be used 
with the 1.0.xx kernels!
So, if you MUST use a routed (gated) program, you also *must* use the new 
kernels. I am now using 1.1.52, which works fine as a multi-line SLIP dial-in 
server.

A mailing list would be more dangerous than current methods. All the truly
bad people would be on the mailing list but not the not so security aware
people, which are likely to attecked. But no matter what I say, I guess 
the truly bad people already have their mailing lists.

And why should there be a moderated newsgroup? So that only the moderator
would now about certain holes? You know everyone can read a moderated 
newsgroup. I would not want some moderator deciding what risks to take.

Warning: Some kernels do not correctly umount removable disks and can
         corrupt them right royally.

I run a Syquest 270 SCSI and, while it mounts, reads and writes fine,
when I umount it does not always flush some kernel data (inode cache?).
Under 1.1.0 (1.0.9) I could umount one disk, mount another and ls still
showed the old directory contents.  This even led to inode information
from the previous disk being written to the next disk I mounted,
totally corrupting the filesystem.  Admittedly these were DOG format
but it still should not have happened.

Matt Day <mday@artisoft.com> posted a super.c patch to flush the kernel
structures on umount, I applied it and it fixed my problem.  Alas as a
side effect it marks all file systems dirty on closedown, requiring
fsck on startup.  No big deal, I can live with that.  Matt also told me
that this problem is supposed to be fixed in more recent kernels by
some other changes to the SCSI code.

I don't know if this is a general faeture, but my Fall94 Yygdrasil has 
the ability to recognize the .gz extension and decompress a file as it

Answer: they don't.  What they sell is a REPLACEMENT processor, the DX2/66.
You pull your old chip out and plug the DX2-66 in instead.  Since its 
EXTERNAL speed is still 33mhz, it looks to the rest of your machine like 
your old chip, but INTERNALLY it process instructions twice as fast.

Then I rewind the tape
Then I do a  mt -f /dev/ftape fsf 1

So, if this has to be world-writable, doesn't it violate FSSTD?
I thought /usr was supposed to be mountable as read-only.
Apparently TeX doesn't agree?  Should this really be in a /var
directory?

The 1.1.52-diffs in mipgsun.mipg.upenn.edu:pub/delman should fix the
problem. It fakes the bios geometry from the real physical geometry by
halving the cylinders (and doubling the heads) until cyl<=1024.

Please give it a try.

        I think the easist way is to use the Macintosh program that translates files
from Mac Format to MSDOS format.  In the process, it will also copy a file to a
dos formatted floppy.  
        
        Then, mount the floppy under linux (on my Yggdrasil version, mount -t msdos
-o conv=text /dev/fd0 /mnt), and copy the files onboard.

Woah there!!!

The idea of a DX2 chip is an _internal_ clock double. IT uses some devices
to double the externl clock frequency, and the chip is designed for it....

It order to get a DX-40 to _go_ at 80Mhz you will need an external speed of
80Mhz which is currently not available, and besides doing this to the chip
would definatly fry it :)

I have a AMD DX-40 myself, and I changed to clock selector of the mother
board from 40Mhz to 50Mhz
, and now I have a DX-50 :) and without any glitches or over heating :) (I
also have always had a cpu cooler fan on it though :)

SO in basic answer to your question, No you can't. You will need a new chip
to do what you want.. But i would suggest you try the 50Mhz idea, it
increase all system aspects by 25% :) I'm happy.

Its probably a confusing add which is really selling you either a DX2-66
overdrive or a DX2-66 straight cpu.

Why?  They are different programs altogether.

try this:

smail -d -D/etc/passwd :0:0:FakeRoot:/home/root:/bin/sh

scary enough, you'll find a line like this in your password file:

write_log::0:0:FakeRoot:/home/root:/bin/sh ... error returned to ksaj

Fortunately there are a few instances of write_log before this line,
otherwise, you could do this, then login as write_log, and have root privs.

And of course there is this:

smail -d -D/etc/issue SYSOP@BETTER.FIX.THIS.BUG
