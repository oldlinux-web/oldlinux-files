I am running Linux 1.1.51 using smail for mail and Cnews for 
news. My UUCP feed delivers both news and mail correctly .
Internal news and mail are posted correctly . 

I have two problems . I cannot send external mail and cannot get
Local produced news postings to my UUCP feed . I have read the
appropriate Orilley books and the Linux Docs and Howto's and
still am stumped .

My understanding is that for smail , I need to have a smart host
and smart path defined in the config file . I have smart host
defined for my UUCP feed and smart path set to uux . My 
understanding is that this is all that is neccessary . The error 
message is that /bin/uuname fails . If I use uuname manually , It
shows my UUCP feed with no problems . What should I do ? If I
untar the whole smail package in both slackware 1.2 and 2.0 , I
not only do not have external mail ; but, my internal mail errors
out.

My understanding for news is that I need my UUCP feed defined 
with the L switch in my sys file . I have this done . The docs 
all disagree with what is needed in the command part . I have
tried all the various combinations suggested and they all do not
work . These combinations do not produce error messages . What 
should I do next ?

I would like both news and mail to dial the UUCP feed on demand .
To reduce wasted bandwidth , please respond by e-mail to
mbguest@fastbox.ridgecrest.ca.us . I will summarize.

It would if the comments were right, but the comments in the code

Nope. Using DOSEMU the tapedrive is not recognized. In this QS3 is not

Since I've tuned the shells we use a bit I've had no further problems. For
a long while I just told the Linux kernel where to put its posix compliance
and recompiled.

Hi..
I am using Slackware 2.0 dist.
Is there any reason for not cleaning up /tmp directory when the system boot ?
Also, it seems like /usr/tmp is not used.

Unfortunately my experience with these cards has been much worse.
The ards often spew error messages as described in the first post
but they also enjoy locking the system.

I've crashed my gw2k p5-90 5 times now. I run the 1.1.51 kernel
and it makes no difference. I thought bdflush might help. It seemed
to for a while, but it crashed again SUnday. The same exact error
messages spewed to console. It tried to kick the board and died.
I couldn't even cntl-alt-delete and had to use the reset button.

A fix would be most appreciated.

Newsgroups: comp.os.linux.admin
Distribution: 
After swithching to Yggdrasil Fall 94 Kernel 1.1.47 I have experienced extreme
delays when telnetting into my box from my PC over ethernet. Upto a minute of
delay before I see the issue.net message and a login prompt.  This did not occur
using the 1.1.0 kernel.  It also takes a long time to ping the box, although
pinging my PC from the linux box is ok and telnetting out over my slip is fine.
I am using gated 3.5 alpha, but this was happening even running routed. Every
thing is fine once I get in, but it is so slooooow to login! Any ideas?

Ahem... if close() really doesn't return, a kill won't make any difference.

Anyway, a cursory look at 1.1.53 doesn't reveal any loops the close could
hang in.
Which kernel/sliplogin version are you using?

Edit your /etc/lilo.conf file and add this line:
append = "ether=0,0,eth1"

Rerun lilo.

Reply-To: jkim@panix.com

I have the following setup situation:

I have three physical locations with three separate LAN installations.
I am about to buy a leased line connection to the internet.  The
glitch (I think) is that I need to tie in all three locations under
a single 'C' address via SLIP or PPP.  The question is: can this be
done?  How would the performance be given that the leased line is
56kb and the SLIP connection is via v.fast?  Would PPP perform any better?

Any help will be much appreciated!

I also had this problem, and someone was kind enough to mail me the patch to

A new patch is available for tcpdump 3.0.  This patch adds loopback
support and fixes a bug in libpcap that would only be apparent if you
tried to use it in another program.

For those who don't care about source, a binary is available at:
ftp://ftp.pr.com/linux/tcpdump-3.0-linux-bin3.tar.gz

All patches I've made to tcpdump 3.0 are also available in the same
