Subject: libc-4.4.4 breaks idraw
Date: 1 Mar 1994 22:59:44 GMT

after upgrading from libc 4.4.4 to libc 4.5.21
my idraw stopped working. It reports

        Undefined C library functions:
        1. light C shared image (Use the real one instead.)

when invoked.

After removing lic.so.4.5.21 and running ldconfig -v
idraw runs again and fine. I understand that the
problem lies with the fact that idraw is an old
execuatble, produced by an old g++ compiler.

Is re-compiling idraw an option ?
Does anybody have an idraw execuable that is
happy with libc.s0.4.5.21 ?

What ever happened to backward-compatibility ?

Any help or insight is appreciated.

I don't think this is true at all.  I haven't read the GPL that closely,
nor have I asked RMS for the FSF's lawyers' opinion on the issue, but
the FSF has never stated the Elisp files are automatically GPL'ed, even
though they may be run only under Emacs, nor are programs that use
GCC extensions like complex numbers or alignment predicates auto-GPL'ed.

I think that the current FSF position is more clearly implied by the
spirit of the law than by the letter of it.  Obviously, writing a
Linux program that uses /proc is not creating a "derived work" in
the somewhat extended FSF version of the word, but writing a kernel
device driver that loads by the 'insmod' modules program at runtime
is creating such a derived work.  What's the technical difference?
Well, they both use Linux-only interfaces (Linux /proc is vastly
different from any other existing /proc).  Obviously, the latter
modifies the kernel, thereby creating a derived work, while the
former does not, but I have a very difficult time defending that position.

The point is, I think that it is important to make the FSF opinion
clear on these matters, even if their opinion might not be legally
defensible with the current version of the GPL.  Any firm interested
in marketing software for Linux should be aware of these issues,
not only for their own protection but also so they won't be scared
off by incorrect or misleading claims.

What probably happened: the modem echoed the commands sent to it,
and/or replied with OK and ERROR
Then, getty was happily chatting with the modem (or with itself,
actually).  This generates a lot of serial traffic, and thereby
exposes the overrun problem which is latently present.

uugetty knows how to handle modems, and does not go into this loop.

I have been using it for months, started using the actual code whith 
the serial patches against pl14, whith no particular problems.

I get an average speed of 1650 cps in v32bis mode, whith a 38400 link to
the modem, and whith 16550 or 16450 UART's. (but obviously getting tty
overruns whith the 16450). The (386/25) machine does intensive dialouts
and receives about 20-40 dialin calls a day, everything is fine.

Ftp transfers whith a PPP or SLIP connection give 1.3K / 1.4K speed.

I also  have sometimes my old MS/DOS PC/XT connected as dumb terminal at
9600 bauds, it works. 

As you see, I'm an happy user of the serial code :-)

I have  the same card in one of my two machines.
When there is a small network problem, like the Ethernet disconnected
during less than 1 second, the card seems to hang (not always), and I get 
these messages.

I have to issue a COLD reboot to correct this.

No problem whith the Ne2000 clone plugged in my second machine...

But most of the time, it works fine.

Thanks for the fix.  Have you come across a fix for a kernel panic that
says "Free list contains shared buffers"?  I got this last night - the
system was relatively quiet, having finished a fairly large compile
(lots of swapping) about 15 minutes earlier.

Yea!  Another one bites the dust.  :)  You didn't notice in the release

If you do that, many of your problems will magically disappear.  *grin*

It does. It's alpha but it does. Or, more specifically, we can load COFF 
format binaries, we can load ELF format binaries and we can emulate both 
SVR4 (popularly refered to as iBCS2 compatibility by commercial vendors with 
SVR4 based offerings) and SVR3 kernel interfaces - SVR3 in, at least, SCO, 
ISC and Wyse Unix V/386 flavours including TCP/IP.

  Even more specifically I have the Uniplex office automation suite, 
Informix SQL/SE and WordPerfect 5.1 (all SCO versions) running happily. 
WordPerfect works in X mode as well when talking to the display via TCP/IP 
at localhost:0.

Join the IBCS2 channel on the linux-activists mailing list. Right now you 
can write tests - lots of tests :-). Everything from short programs that 
exercise a single system call - return values, boundary conditions, 
over/under runs, bad data handling - to great monolithic stonkers! It's 
easier to debug from code than to employ psychic abilities on real 
applications :-).

You lose 16 bytes per "page". Next you loose 8 or so bytes per block

The "optimal" values can be calculated from the table in kmalloc.c
by subtracting 8 this leads to the following numbers:

Thanks for the comments, but I can see I posed my question

the '386 so that I could easily move between BIOS based code

For my needs Linux, NT, OS/2, DOS extenders, etc only complicated

"Standard"... My personal opinion is that anybody using _doprnt
deserves to be punished. It is not documented and is not intended to
be used. It is callable (on sytems where it is available) because of a
flaw in the data abstraction mechanism.

I've just tried to get a compiled .99p14d kernel installed on my home linux
system (slackware 1.1.0 based).  Apparently, due to my not having compiled
a kernel and installed directly on a hard disk (instead of using a boot floppy),
I somehow corrupted my system's ability to boot off my esdi hard drive.

I've found an old posting in c.o.l.a. about getting a bootfloppy from the
origional installation and running /etc/lilo/config from it (I'll be doing
that later today, when I bring my 1.1.0 disks from work home).  However,
i think that a few things need to be changed/added:

1) the basic HOWTOs should say how to compile and install a new kernel
to boot off of floppy, hard drive or whatever.  examples using lilo
should also be given.

2) need to change README file in kernel source distribution to go through
specific steps on getting the compiled image to the right place (not assume
that an experienced person is doing this).

I'll be sending a message later today to Linus requesting this.
