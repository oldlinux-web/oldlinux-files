Just a followup to say that at least one other has similar woes.
I started at 0.99pl8, and kernel rebuilds were rock solid for a while.
Somewhere around pl12, I started seeing just exactly what is reported
above.  I'm still seeing it with pl15h.

I've commented about it a couple of times in comp.os.linix.whatever, and
responses indicated that it had to be a hardware error.  That's reinforced
by rock-solid rebuilds on other linux installations.  However, I don't
recall seeing anything like this with anything but cc, and can't localize
it to a hardware problems.  Exercising the disks by copying massive amounts
of data works OK, and standalone memory-test programs run overnight report
no problems.

For now, I'm just living with it.  I restart "make zImage" as needed, and
reboot if that doesn't work (the problem appears less frequently on a
recently booted system).

Date: 29 Mar 94 10:15:53 +0200

Hello there !

I'm about to start my own firm consulting and teaching X windows/Motif,
Unix and C. I looking for opinions/experiences on decent hardware
requirements needen to run and develop X/Motif/Unix for personal use.
I do own a PC 486/66, 4Mb/200Mb (IDE) and have thoughts on upgrading it
and install Linux, FreeBSD or something like that.

But since I also want DOS/Windows I understand that I have to buy
another disk for my Unix system. Also it's been said that PC's can't
cope with selected bootings therefore I've been suggested to throw
my IDE disk away and buy a SCSI controller card and a new disk for my
DOS system. Switching disks in the SCSI card will then determine
what system to run. I also believe I need at least 16Mb of memory
to cope with Unix.

My second, and ideal, thought is to buy a proper workstation but the
onces I've been using at my former jobs are far too expensive for
personel use. Are there any that is less expensive ? How about licences,
service agreements, release updates, etc ? I don't mind buying a used one.

What are your suggestions ?        /Thanks a lot

(P.S. The machine should not be used when teaching. D.S.)

'I've been digging for FAQ files that might answer this for a week without
luck; please, somebody help me out here...

When I attempt to link a number of things, such as pppd or xrn, I get a
messages stating that there are multiple definitions of _NEEDS_SHRLIB_libc_4
in /usr/lib/libgcc.sa and /usr/lib/libc.sa.  I tried the obvious things: I
went back for a new copy  of the libraries with shared libs included (and the
stub libraries), but this didn't help.  I tried working with the source of the
libraries, but ran into other problems there...  I definitely have
/lib/libc.so.4 , but I can't believe that the presence of these would change
a multiple definition somewhere else.

I will confess, I originally loaded my system from SLS 1.03 and then later
applied Slackware 1.1.2 over top of it, without destroying the world first, so
my problem may be related to that.   But if it is, can anybody suggest what I
might do about it?

Thanks, anybody who responds... my life is empty without the ability to link
new executables...

I have currently a plip-connection running between a linux-box and

made are: 
 -  strobe bit-levels need to be inverted
 -  throw out plip_type logic: send as ethernet would do
 -  length byte order inverted
 -  there was a "bug" in the send_byte: To allow the data-bits to
    settle first before they are strobed, they were put without the
    strobe bit first, but without masking off the high nibble of the
    data, so sometimes (if data's 0x10 bit was set, this settle-logic
    failed, and this resulted in receive-errors in dos-plip.com, because
    there is only a single asm-in, which is not repeated after the strobe

Oh sorry Antoni. It's just that you mentioned porting the Linux kernel which is
totally unreal at this moment in time. Of course what you're saying is possible.
A device driver already exists for B004 compatible cards, and the iserver and
afserver have already been ported.

I'm not sure what you want, maybe you need to have Xlib for the Transputer, or
maybe come up with your own server. I don't think any part of Linux need run
on the Transputer - just define a protocol by which the two can communicate.

What's wrong with OCCAM? You have to 'at best' extend the syntax of C or depend
on run-time library support to make use of the Transputer's implementation of
parallelism. Okay, I guess it's up to you!

And no, I don't really think you're crazy ;)

Subject: Bug in TIOCCONS ioctl ?
Date: Tue, 29 Mar 1994 15:33:59 GMT


Hello all,

  Yesterday I tried to make xconsole work for normal users and
found that it is not sufficient to set proper permissions for
/dev/console. The method used by xconsole to catch console output
is as follows (xconsole.c:OpenConsole):
        .
        .       
        .
            struct stat sbuf;
            /* must be owner and have read/write permission */
            if (!stat("/dev/console", &sbuf) &&
                (sbuf.st_uid == getuid()) &&
                !access("/dev/console", R_OK|W_OK))
            {
        .
        .       
        .
#if defined(USE_PTY) && !defined(SOLX86)
                int     on = 1;

                if (get_pty (&pty_fd, &tty_fd, ttydev, ptydev) == 0 &&
                    ioctl (tty_fd, TIOCCONS, (char *) &on) != -1)
                {
                    input = fdopen (pty_fd, "r");
                }
#endif
        .       
        .
        .
Even though the permissions for /dev/console are set properly this fails
in the TIOCCONS ioctl (output of strace):
...
stat("/dev/console", {dev 3 2 ino 42 mode 020622 nlink 1 uid 1418 gid 1400 size 
0 ...}) = 0
getuid() = 1418
access("/dev/console", 06) = 0
open("/dev/ptyp0", RDWR) = -1 (Try again)
open("/dev/ptyp1", RDWR) = 4
open("/dev/ttyp1", RDWR) = 5
ioctl(5, TIOCCONS, 0xbffffb04) = -1 (Operation not permitted)
...
This happens  because under linux this ioctl may only be used by root 
(from linux/drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c:tty_ioctl):
        .
        .       
                case TIOCCONS:
                        if (IS_A_CONSOLE(dev)) {
                                if (!suser())
                                        return -EPERM;
                                redirect = NULL;
                                return 0;
                        }
                        if (redirect)
                                return -EBUSY;
                        if (!suser())
                                return -EPERM;
                        if (IS_A_PTY_MASTER(dev))
                                redirect = other_tty;
                        else if (IS_A_PTY_SLAVE(dev))
                                redirect = tty;
                        else
                                return -ENOTTY;
                        return 0;
                case FIONBIO:
        .
        .

IMHO this is a bug which breaks xconsole. I am not a kernel hacker
and can't provide a fix for it. Suggestions and comments are
appreciated.

NFS is a stateless protocol. You are supposed to be able to read 1/3 of

as if nothing had happened.
Negotiation phases in this environment lose.
Broken design goals, perhaps.

I think it is a relic of the max IP packet size, which is in turn
a relic of the 4Kbyte atomic allocation limit in the kernel.
(so why not a 2K limit? Don't ask me....)

I'm working for a telephony company that is bumping up against the constraints
of having to use finite state machines under DOS to multitask handling making
phone line connections and maintaining them, etc.  They want to make the
switch to Linux.  Right now their DOS machines all use Rhetorex cards, so they
are most interested in using Rhetorex under Linux.  Rhetorex has a SYSV
driver, but no Linux support.  They appear willing to let me write a driver
for Linux, however.  I am an experienced UNIX programmer, have several Linux 
boxes, and know Linux well.  I've only dabbled in driver writing before, 
however.  My company has got me started learning driver writing in preparation
for the looming possiblility of writing the Rhetorex driver.

At this stage, I'd like to get in touch with anyone else working on telephony
drivers or apps under Linux, or anyone who'd benefit from a Rhetorex driver.
I'd also like to know what other drivers exist, if any, for digital telephony.

Thanks...

I got this error after updating my gcc, libc, etc. I was able to fix things
by deleting the old /usr/lib/libgcc.sa which is not part of the new 
distribution, and adding links from 
        /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i486-linux/2.5.8/libgcc.a to /usr/lib/libgcc.a
and some others. I still don't know if I have things set up correctly,
but I am able to compile Xt and Xm programs. This info is in the release
doc, but the instructions are pretty poor, to be honest. 

Hope this helps,

Hi everyone!

While trying to install httpd on my machine, I encountered a problem.
This things always tried to tell me that directories are redirected to
port 20480 (instead of the usual port 80 for http). I tracked this down
and found  that this problem only occurs if httpd is run from inetd. In
that case it tries to determine the port number for stdin/out. I
extracted this code to test it seperately:

============
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

main()
{
  struct sockaddr addr;
  int len;
  unsigned short int p;
  
  len = sizeof(struct sockaddr);
  getsockname(fileno(stdin),&addr,&len);
  p = ((struct sockaddr_in *)&addr)->sin_port;
  printf("port %d\n",  p );
}

========================

Now, if I put a line in inetd.conf to call this program on, let's say,
service http, and I "telnet localhost http" it should print "80", which
is the value in /etc/services. Instead it returns 20480. I tried this on
some other ports, and there's a system: 80=0x50, 20480=0x5000. Ah, you
get the picture, don't you. Motorola meets Intel, there are some bytes
swapped here. I don't know whether this is in gcc or in libc, but it
definitively is wrong.

I have been able to repair this by swapping the bytes, but this sure is
a dirty hack and *very* system dependent, and anyway, this thing is
supposed to work.

Does anyone know whether this is a known feature, and maybe fixed in a
current, not-yet-really-public, release of libc or gcc? I don't have any
sources of those buzzing around (and some fool filled up my disk anyway).

Cheers,

        Hank
